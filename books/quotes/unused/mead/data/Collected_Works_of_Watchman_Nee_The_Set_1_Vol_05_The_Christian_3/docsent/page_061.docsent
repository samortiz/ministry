   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There is also a similar passage in Colossians: "Who is the image of the invisible God, the Firstborn of all creation" 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Does this mean that the Lord Jesus is also a creature, but first among the other creatures?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No, because following this it says, "Because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him; and He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here we see the Lord Jesus as the beginning of God's creation and its relationship to Him as Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Laodicea gave Him no place, but the Bible shows us that the Lord Jesus should "have the first place in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We feel that the Lord Jesus is making a special linkage here.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the book of Colossians, Laodicea is mentioned four times.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Spirit even charged the Laodiceans to read this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a believer realizes that the Lord Jesus is "the beginning of the creation of God," his life and view will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Adam was the first man and the beginning of the first creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But he failed, and everyone in him, who possesses his nature, also fell with him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cross judges everything that is of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the result of the first creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are speaking here of the accomplishment of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Strictly speaking, Adam's life was already judged in Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There, Christ was already the beginning of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, after the cross, there are still many people who have not rejected their Adamic life and are still living in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, even before the actual occurrence of the cross, there were those who had entered the new creation through believing in the accomplishment of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course, the actual event occurred at the cross, even though the matter of crucifixion had been ordained before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the cross God terminated Adam, judged him, and rejected him and caused the second man, who is the Lord from heaven, to forever replace him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ has not come to mend that which is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, He is the beginning of what God has done and will do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as Christ was born, He was the second Man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But before He died and resurrected, He could not yet be the Head of the new life, nor the Head of the Body His church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The old creation was damaged by sin and is now over.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Its history is about to be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Its judgment and its verdict were pronounced on the cross long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ's resurrection from the dead is the real beginning of all those who are God's. This was foreordained according to God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The old creation was used merely to prepare the way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In man's eyes, Adam was the beginning of God's creation, but in God's eyes, the resurrected Christ is the beginning of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the most crucial phase in God's redemption in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can say that this is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's goal is not to improve the old creation or to advance it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has completely rejected the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God would not recognize that the old creation should even exist.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In saying that the Lord Jesus is "the beginning of the creation of God," He is discrediting even the old creation of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He considers the Lord Jesus as the beginning and Adam as nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His goal now is nothing other than the total removal of everything in the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is building everything of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a man is joined by faith to the Lord Jesus in His death and resurrection, He grants such a one a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This new life includes all the nature, instinct, and majesty of God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This new creation even includes all God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In a more confined context, this new life is the regenerated life in man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This life includes all the functions of God's creature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is what 2 Corinthians 5:17 describes as "anyone...in Christ," that is, anyone who is related to Christ in life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"He is a new creation" because a new man has already been installed into him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God no longer cares for the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Neither does He want the believers to care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His goal is now the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is our position.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the day that we are regenerated and receive a new life, God considers us as completely new.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, this has to be worked out in practice.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Experientially speaking, at that time the believers have only received a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Much or even all the old creation may still remain.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God now expects His believers to work together with the Holy Spirit and to put to death through the accomplishment of the cross everything that is of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He desires to see every one of us die with the Lord Jesus and lose our old creation through death so that we can allow the new creation to grow and fill up everything in the newness of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>By the time the Lord Jesus comes, we will be delivered from the body of the old creation and will receive a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At that time the work of redemption will have been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In taking the Lord Jesus as the beginning of the creation of God, God has rejected everything of the Adamic creation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are still ignorant of this and are still trying to accomplish God's holy demands with our mind, emotion, and will of the old creation, or if we think that we still have any strength to do God's will or have any intention to please God, and if we still do not realize our utter corruption and see that our only place is the place of death where we will fully trust in the Lord, we still do not understand what the Christian life means.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we know that Christ is the beginning of the creation of God, we will realize that nothing is according to the will of God unless it is initiated by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What we initiate is not God's creation nor God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The world has never done anything to initiate man's qualification as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Anything that we initiate is of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, since Christ is the beginning of the creation of God, all those who follow Him must bear this nature of Christ as well.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, everything that does not bear the nature of Christ will not survive in God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, if Christ was outside Laodicea, how could Laodicea find its riches in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet they said that they were wealthy and had become rich and had need of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This was what they counted as gain.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is a pity that they did not count them as loss for Christ's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They had not learned what was of the old creation, which needed to be rejected, and what was of the new creation, which needed to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They had forgotten that Christ is the beginning of the creation of God and that they should have continued in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Instead, they had accumulated from themselves many things of the old creation apart from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That is why the Lord spoke such a name to them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They should have manifested the power of the new creation through the Holy Spirit and should have considered everything to be of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Yet they considered themselves too highly and aligned themselves with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At such a time, if we would lift up our faces toward the heavens and would see that although everything is lost from our hands and although we are put to remorse and shame, God will be satisfied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Is this not a consolation to us?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The believers have very seriously misapplied the truth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God's purpose for giving the law was "that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God" Rom 3:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How did the people of God apply the law?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They tried to be justified by the law and establish their own righteousness by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Is it not the same with those under grace?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God's verdict is that there is no goodness in the flesh and that the flesh cannot please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For this reason He points out to us the importance of regeneration and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But what do the believers do?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They hope that by taking in the new life they can heal their flesh: "Before we received the new life, our flesh might have been corrupted, but now that we have the new life, perhaps the flesh can learn from it and can improve itself."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although the believers may not say this, this is what they practice.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If believers would accept God's verdict, how could they depend on the flesh, utilize the flesh, or expect the flesh to gradually change?</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>One thing, however, is sure: God only recognizes the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He sees no other place for the old creation except death.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The truth of the new creation also means to us that this world is under the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Yet in their nature, the believers always love to mend.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>What God wants is a world of the new creation, but what man wants is an improved world.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Man's thought is always different from the goal of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We can see with our eyes the work of the Holy Spirit in many places at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Yet what He is doing is to "rescue us out of the present evil age" Gal 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Man's ideal is to have a kingdom of heaven realized, a utopian society, and a Christianized world, but the result of such a work is a secularization of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Hence, we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We should not think that we know this truth already.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The question is whether or not we have experienced this truth and have practiced it.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>How can we say on the one hand that we are a new creation, while on the other hand hold on to "the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life" of the old creation 1 John 2:16 ?</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>How can we act independently without first waiting for the order of Christ, the Head of the new creation?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>How can we walk according to our own strength?</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>As much as we have followed ourselves, to that extent we are Laodicea.</S>
