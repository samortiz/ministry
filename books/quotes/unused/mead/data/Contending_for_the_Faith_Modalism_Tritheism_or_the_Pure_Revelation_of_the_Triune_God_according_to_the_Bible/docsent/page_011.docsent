   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S INTENTION IN REVEALING HIMSELF AS THE UNIQUE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After this consideration of the pure revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible, it should be evident to any fair-minded reader that the biblical revelation of the Triune God is twofold: He is the Three being one, and He is the One being three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What a marvelous mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both modalism and tritheism have been proved false.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of these two heretical alternatives both of which stress one aspect of the truth in an unbalanced way we proclaim the twofold aspect of God's revelation in His Word without any attempt at reconciliation or systematization.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When people consider the Triune God objectively, trying to analyze what He is in His inner being, they emphasize the aspect of the one-in-three.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when we experience the indwelling of the Triune God subjectively, we enjoy the aspect of the three-in-one, for the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us as one Eph 4:6; Col 1:27; John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>While the objective study of the Triune God has some value and may sometimes be necessary, it certainly is neither the emphasis of the New Testament nor the best way to cooperate with God in His desire to dispense Himself into us for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once we have established what the pure Word says concerning our wonderful Triune God, we should simply rest upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As Henry Barclay Swete has said, "The Spirit alone searches the depths of God, and where the Spirit is silent as to their contents it is hazardous and indeed vain to speculate."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>82 Cyril of Jerusalem A.D. 315-386 , who depreciated theological speculation, who focused his attention on experience, and who was reluctant to go beyond the word of the Bible, once remarked:</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>but inquire not curiously into His nature or substance: for had it been written we would have spoken of it; what is not written, let us not venture on; it is sufficient for our salvation to know that there is Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>83</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Any attempts to go beyond God's revelation of Himself in His pure Word will only lead us into the snare of endless analysis, reasoning, and disputation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The result of this path is spiritual death, the consequence of trying to understand God according to the principle of the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That the "revelation of the Triune God in the Scriptures should be kept as a fact and as a mystery for our experience" is testified to by the Puritan writer Robert Leighton A.D. 1611-1684 :</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As to the mystery of the Most-Holy Trinity I have always thought it was to be received and adored with the most humble faith and reverence, but by no means to be curiously searched into, or perplexed with the presumptuous questions of the schoolmen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We fell by an arrogant ambition of knowledge; by simple faith we rise again and are reinstated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And this mystery indeed, beyond all others, seems to be a tree of knowledge prohibited to us while we sojourn in these mortal bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>84</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This same humble attitude is expressed by Philip Schaff:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Nicene Fathers did not pretend to have exhausted the mystery of the Trinity, and very well understood that all human knowledge, especially in this deepest, central dogma, proves itself but fragmentary.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All speculation on divine things ends in a mystery before which the thinking mind must bow in humble adoration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>85</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As those who receive with simplicity the whole scriptural revelation of the Triune God, let us turn to Him, open to Him, and enjoy Him as our life and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's intention in revealing Himself as the unique Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is not that we might formulate doctrines of the Trinity and engage in endless arguments about them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, it is to prepare the way for Him to dispense Himself into us according to His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, let us turn from the way of mental analysis, which has led either to the heretical extremes of modalism and tritheism or to a rigid and lifeless orthodoxy, and turn to the way of receiving in simple faith the whole revelation of the Triune God in the pure word of the Bible and of appropriating Him in spirit as our life and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the wonderful Triune God, the three-in-one and the one-in-three, be our portion and enjoyment now and forever.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit" be with us all.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Amen.</S>
