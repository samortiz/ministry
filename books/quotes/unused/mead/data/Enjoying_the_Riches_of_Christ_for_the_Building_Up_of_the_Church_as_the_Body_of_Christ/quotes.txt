[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Chicago, Illinois in August and September of 1971.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 1:5, 9, 17-23; 2:15; 3:8-11; 4:11-12 GOD'S PURPOSE, WILL, AND GOOD PLEASURE
[4]  The eternal purpose of God mentioned in Ephesians 3:11 is the purpose God made in and for eternity.
[5]  THE CROSS OF CHRIST PRODUCING THE ONE NEW MAN
[6]  On the negative side, Christ abolished all the ordinances on the cross, and on the positive side, He created one new man of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles.
[7]  Today this one new man is the Body of Christ, the church.
[8]  We know that Christ died on the cross for our sins, yet few have heard that Christ died on the cross to create the one new man, the church.
[9]  Ephesians 1:19-22 speaks of the surpassing greatness of His power, "which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church."
[10]  We may say that our believing into Christ made us happy, but even if we were weeping, we would still have to believe into Him because a kind of power came into us.
[11]  ENJOYING THE RICHES OF CHRIST TO BECOME THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST
[12]  The power of Christ is one thing, but the riches of Christ are another.
[13]  We not only must experience the power of Christ; we also must enjoy all the riches of Christ Eph 3:8 .
[14]  We should pray-read the verses in this message until we enter into the truth and experience of the purpose of God; the cross of Christ, which produced the new man; the power wrought in Christ, which is transmitted to us that we may be the church; the riches of Christ for our enjoyment that we may be the fullness of Christ; and the gifted persons, who are given to the Body by the Head for the building up of the Body.
[15]  CHAPTER TWO THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY FOR THE DISPENSING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 3:8-10; Col 1:15-18; Isa 9:6; Matt 16:16-18; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Col 3:4a, 10-11; 2:6; 1 Cor 6:17 CHRIST BEING MYSTERIOUS AND INCOMPREHENSIBLE
[16]  The source of the church is Christ; the church comes out of Christ.
[17]  Yet the more we study the Bible, the more we realize that it is difficult to completely comprehend who and what Christ is.
[18]  I know that I have a mind, an emotion, and a will; I know that I have two hearts; I know that I have a soul and a spirit; and I know that I have a physical life, a soulish life, and a spiritual life.
[19]  Forty years ago I thought I was very clear about Christ, but today, if you ask me about Christ, I must confess that although I know much about Him, I am not very clear about Him.
[20]  Colossians 1:18 reveals that Christ is the Firstborn from the dead.
[21]  Philippians 1:21 says, "For to me, to live is Christ," and Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me."
[22]  The all-inclusive Christ, the very Christ who is all and in all, is our life Col 3:4 .
[23]  Today He is in us, for He cannot be our life without being in us.
[24]  Some say that Christ is only in the heavens, yet they also say that Christ is their life.
[25]  May the Lord be merciful to us to bring us back to the proper understanding of His economy and the realization that we need the dispensing of Christ.
[26]  God's creation is to bring us into being, incarnation is to bring God into us, crucifixion is to terminate us, resurrection is to bring us into God, ascension is to bring the Body into the Head, and descension is to bring the Head into the Body.
[27]  When Christ ascended into the heavens, He brought all of us into the heavens Eph 4:8 .
[28]  CHAPTER THREE THE DISPENSING OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 15:26; 16:13-15; 6:63a; 20:22; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:6b, 17-18; Rom 12:2-5; 1 Cor 12:12-13
[29]  In the previous chapters we have seen that God's purpose is to have the church and that the church comes out of the dispensing of the riches of Christ.
[30]  Today we are still under the process of the dispensing of Christ.
[31]  God's economy is to dispense Christ into us, and to dispense Christ into us simply means to work Christ into us.
[32]  The economy of God is simply a matter of the dispensing of Christ into all of us, and the issue of God's dispensing of Christ is the church.
[33]  We heard that we were sinful and that we were going to hell, but God was so merciful to us that by His great love He loved us, He saved us, He granted us repentance, He gave us faith, He forgave all our sins, and He even regenerated us; now we are qualified to enter into the heavens to enjoy eternal life.
[34]  Without the proper measure of Christ we cannot have the proper church life because the church life is the issue of the dispensing of Christ, the issue of God's working of Christ into us.
[35]  THE SPIRIT OF REALITY FOR THE DISPENSING OF THE TRIUNE GOD Sent by the Son from with the Father
[36]  The verses in the Scripture reading at the beginning of this chapter are firstly from the Gospel of John.
[37]  The Gospel of John begins with "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" 1:1 .
[38]  It goes on to say, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him" v. 18 . This book starts with God, goes on to show us the Father, and continues to show us that He is the Son.
[39]  Christ Becoming the Life-giving Spirit to Impart Life to Us
[40]  We may illustrate the dispensing of Christ with a watermelon.
[41]  As the Spirit of reality He comes into us to bring us into all reality, but the main thing we must realize is that the Spirit imparts life into us.
[42]  As we behold and reflect the Lord with an unveiled face, we are being transformed v. 18 . To be transformed is not to have an outward change.
[43]  CHAPTER FOUR THE DISPENSING OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST THROUGH HIS WORD Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 4:24; 5:39-40; 6:35a, 57b, 63; 14:23; 15:7-8; 17:17; 1 John 5:6b; Col 3:16; Eph 5:18-19; 6:17-18; Jer 15:16
[44]  In the previous chapters we saw that the eternal purpose of God is to have the church, that the church comes out of the dispensing of the riches of Christ, and that in His economy God eventually became the all-inclusive Spirit.
[45]  It is by this Spirit that all the riches of Christ are being dispensed into us.
[46]  The Lord Jesus seemed to say, "I am one with the Scriptures, and the Scriptures are one with Me. If you come to the Scriptures, you have to come to Me. If you research the Scriptures, you have to come to Me. You have to make the Scriptures one with Me; instead, you have made the Scriptures something separate from Me. Therefore, you are wrong.
[47]  LEARNING TO TOUCH THE SPIRIT AND LIFE IN THE BIBLE
[48]  There is a further problem, which is related to our different organs.
[49]  As humans we have eyes and ears, and we have something deeper, which is our mind and heart.
[50]  Our coming to the Bible should always be our coming to the Lord Jesus.
[51]  The Bible should always be one with the Lord.
[52]  If we do not understand the Bible, we should not be bothered.
[53]  The Lord has shown us in a definite way that we must practice pray-reading.
[54]  Eventually, through our pray-reading we will see that Christ is God, the Lamb, the Creator, the creature, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, life, light, love, the King, the Priest, the Prophet, every kind of tree, wheat, corn, milk, honey, water, green grass, tender pasture, and the cattle.
[55]  CHAPTER FIVE GOD IN CHRIST AS OUR FOOD Scripture Reading: Col 1:15a; 3:4a; John 6:57; 1 Cor 8:1; Rev 2:7b, 17; 22:2a, 14
[56]  From the beginning God has had an intention, but this intention was neglected by the entire human race.
[57]  When the Lord Jesus came, He labored to restore God's intention and to bring people back to the beginning.
[58]  He promised to give these overcomers to eat according to His original intention, that is, to eat of the tree of life 2:7 , to eat of the hidden manna v. 17 , and to dine, to feast, with Him 3:20 . The Lord's promise to the overcomers reminds us of three significant times of eating in the Old Testament: 1 the eating of the tree of life in the garden of Eden as a sign to the man created by God; 2 the eating of manna as a blessing to God's people while they wandered in the wilderness; and 3 the eating of the produce of the good land in the yearly feasts.
[59]  THE TREE OF LIFE BEING GOD IN CHRIST AS LIFE IN THE FORM OF FOOD
[60]  Many of us have been taught that in the Lord's table meeting we should remember the Lord by exercising our mind to recall how the Lord was the One on the throne in the heavens, how one day He became a little child born in a manger, how He lived in a carpenter's home, how He came out to carry out His ministry, how He was persecuted, arrested, tested, sentenced, and brought to Calvary, and how He was put on the cross.
[61]  I had this kind of remembrance many times when I was young.
[62]  However, in Matthew 26:26 the Lord said, "Take, eat; this is My body," and in Luke 22:19 He said, "This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me."
[63]  CHRIST BEING THE CHILDREN'S BREAD AND THE CRUMBS UNDER THE TABLE
[64]  RECOVERING THE CHURCH LIFE AS THE ISSUE OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST
[65]  We all have to realize what the church life is.
[66]  EATING JESUS BY EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO CONTACT HIM
[67]  From the first page to the last page of the Bible, there is the eating of the Lord.
[68]  Many know that Jesus is the bread of life, and some also know that we need to feed on Jesus, but they do not know the way to eat Him, to feed upon Him, and to be nourished by Him.
[69]  Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit."
[70]  CHAPTER SIX TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: Gen 2:22; 1 Cor 3:12a; Rev 21:19a EATING CHRIST AS THE TREE OF LIFE
[71]  In the previous chapter we spoke of eating Christ as the tree of life in the form of food.
[72]  This is revealed in full from the very beginning of the Bible, through the whole content of the Bible, to the end of the Bible.
[73]  The Bible begins with the tree of life, it continues with the tree of life, and it closes with the tree of life.
[74]  BEING TURNED FROM TEACHINGS AND GIFTS TO CHRIST AS FOOD
[75]  The Lord has burdened us with the revelation that teachings can never build up the church.
[76]  Teachings help us to realize that we need Christ as life, and good, proper teachings minister Christ to us as life.
[77]  We all need Christ, not Christ in doctrine, but the living Christ as the life-giving Spirit.
[78]  Gifts help us to take Christ, but if we substitute the gifts for Christ, we are wrong.
[79]  If we have the infilling in our spirit, we surely will have the outflow into our mind.
[80]  We all have to realize that the main thing that we need to build up a local church is to take Jesus as our life to eat Him, to drink of Him, and to breathe Him in. Then all the pieces of clay will be transformed.
[81]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST IN 1 CORINTHIANS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:30; 12:3; 1:2, 9, 22-23 EATING JESUS BEING THE BASIC CONCEPT IN THE BIBLE
[82]  As we have seen in previous chapters, from the beginning to the end of the Bible the main, central, and basic concept of God is that we must eat Jesus.
[83]  After God created man, He put him in front of the tree of life, indicating that man should eat the tree of life.
[84]  When the Lord Jesus came, He presented Himself to us as the bread of life John 6:35 .
[85]  First Corinthians begins in a special way: "Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours" 1:1-2 .
[86]  THE CALLED SAINTS CALLING UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD
[87]  In verse 2 there are two kinds of calling.
[88]  First we have been called by the Lord; then we have to call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[89]  First Corinthians 1:30 says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption."
[90]  CHRIST AS THE LAST ADAM BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT
[91]  We have been called into the fellowship of Jesus Christ.
[92]  Therefore, we have been called into the participation and enjoyment of Christ.
[93]  Day by day, we fellowship with this Christ, we enjoy this Christ, and we participate in this Christ.
[94]  Many have heard much about the Holy Spirit, the baptism of the Holy Spirit, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit, but few have heard that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.
[95]  The Christ who was made wisdom to us from God as our righteousness for our past, as our sanctification for our present, and as our redemption for our future is the life-giving Spirit today.
[96]  CHAPTER EIGHT EATING, DRINKING, GROWING, TRANSFORMATION, AND BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:2; 5:7b-8; 10:3-4, 16-18, 21; 11:23-25; 12:13b, 3b; 3:6, 9b, 12a
[97]  From the verses in the Scripture reading above we can see the unique matters of eating, drinking, growing, transformation, and building.
[98]  The word transformed is used in 2 Corinthians 3:18, which says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."
[99]  To this Paul said, "Is Christ divided?" v. 13 . Secondly, this book deals with the excommunication of an evil brother 5:1-13 . A sinful brother committed incest with his stepmother, so Paul told the Corinthians to remove the evil man from among them v. 13 . In chapter six is the dealing with lawsuits among believers 6:1-11 and dealing with the abuse of freedom 6:12-20 . In chapter seven is the dealing with marriage life 7:1-40 . Following this is the dealing with the eating of things sacrificed to idols 8:1 11:1 with the vindication of Paul's apostleship and authority 9:1-27 . In chapter eleven are the matters of head covering 11:2-16 and the Lord's supper 11:17-34 . Then in 12:1 14:40 is the dealing with the gifts.
[100]  In 1 Corinthians there are many verses dealing with the matter of eating and drinking.
[101]  Paul went on to say that Christ is our Passover 5:7 .
[102]  Following chapter ten is the Lord's supper in chapter eleven.
[103]  Although I was in Christianity for many years, and I attended the so-called communion many times, I never heard anyone say that to remember the Lord is to eat Him and to drink Him.
[104]  The Lord Jesus told us to eat and drink in remembrance of Him 11:24-25; Matt 26:26-27 .
[105]  To remember the Lord Jesus is to eat Him, to take Him in. "Take, eat; this is My body" Matt 26:26 ; "this do unto the remembrance of Me" 1 Cor 11:24 . "Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood" Matt 26:27-28 ; "this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me" 1 Cor 11:25 .
[106]  CHAPTER NINE CHRIST AS LIFE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:18-23; John 3:6b, 29-30; 12:24; 19:34; Matt 13:3, 24; 1 Cor 3:6, 9b; Rev 19:7; 21:2, 9b
[107]  In Genesis 2:21-23 Eve was presented to Adam as a bride; in John 3:29 the believers are a bride to Christ as the Bridegroom; and in the book of Revelation, at the conclusion of the Bible, the bride is mentioned again 21:2, 9; 22:17 .
[108]  THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE FULFILLED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[109]  Adam was a type of Christ, the Man, and Eve was a type of the church as the bride to Christ Eph 5:25-32 .
[110]  In Christianity we heard many messages telling us that we were sinful and that Christ died on the cross for our sins.
[111]  This is true, but these messages never told us that Christ died on the cross to produce the church.
[112]  Adam was a type of Christ, and Adam's sleep was a type of the death of Christ on the cross.
[113]  The growth in life is revealed in Matthew 13.
[114]  In this chapter the Lord Jesus told us that He came not as a teacher but as a Sower to sow Himself as the seed of life into us vv.
[115]  Pentecostal Christianity, reacting to the deadness of fundamental Christianity, cares mainly for the gifts, especially tongue-speaking.
[116]  I spoke in tongues more than thirty-five years ago, but after carefully studying the Bible concerning this matter, I dropped this practice.
[117]  In this century, perhaps no one has been used by the Lord as much as Watchman Nee.
[118]  If we read and pray-read the New Testament again and again, we will see that our primary need is Jesus Christ, who became the life-giving Spirit as our life and life supply.
[119]  CHAPTER TEN LIFE, GROWTH, AND TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; 1:8-9; 4:7-8, 10; 12:9; Rom 8:28-29
[120]  However, we must realize that transformation is not simple.
[121]  BEING PRESSED TO TRUST IN THE GOD WHO RAISES THE DEAD
[122]  Paul also said they were "unable to find a way out" v. 8b . He did not know what to do or what to say.
[123]  Verse 10 says, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus."
[124]  In 1:8 and 9 Paul said, "For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living.
[125]  Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead."
[126]  Recently some young people asked me to fellowship with them about marriage.
[127]  I told them that thirty-five years ago I had many things to say about marriage.
[128]  We must not forget, however, that without water in the pot the fire will burn the food.
[129]  While our dear wife is cooking us, we must call, "O Lord Jesus."
[130]  CHAPTER ELEVEN MINISTERING CHRIST BY PROPHESYING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:7a; 12:1-13, 27-31; 13:1-2, 8, 11; 14:1, 4-6, 12, 18-19, 23-26, 31-32, 39 TEACHINGS AND GIFTS BEING RELATED TO CHILDREN
[131]  Ephesians 4 mentions the teachings of doctrines, while 1 Corinthians 12 and 14 speak about the gifts.
[132]  I wish to impress you that in the New Testament, teachings and gifts are childish.
[133]  In Christianity today the traditional teaching about gifts is not trustworthy.
[134]  One traditional teaching concerning the meetings says that there are nine gifts as manifestations of the Spirit.
[135]  For to one through the Spirit a word of wisdom is given, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit; to a different one faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing in the one Spirit, and to another operations of works of power, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits; to a different one various kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues."
[136]  It is greater to prophesy than to speak in tongues.
[137]  Verses 23 and 24 of chapter fourteen say, "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place, and all speak in tongues, and some unlearned in tongues or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?
[138]  In all the writings of the apostle Paul we can find only a few predictions.
[139]  CHAPTER TWELVE CALLING ON THE LORD IN OUR DAILY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 24; 5:7b-8; 12:13, 3b, 31; 13:1; 14:1, 5, 23-26, 31-32, 39; 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 2:14-15
[140]  First Corinthians may be considered the richest, most wonderful book in the New Testament.
[141]  If we wish to know how a Christian must live day by day, we have to come to this book.
[142]  Verse 2 of chapter one continues to say, "With all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[143]  We have to call upon the name of the Lord.
[144]  First Corinthians 12:13 says, "For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit."
[145]  BUILDING UP THE CHURCH BY PROPHESYING WITH A LIVING SPIRIT
[146]  Acts 9:14 says that Paul received authority from the chief priests to go to Damascus to cast into prison all who called on the name of the Lord.
[147]  The more we call, the more we gain, enjoy, and experience Christ, and the more Christ we have.
[148]  Day by day we live by Christ, we enjoy Christ, we experience Christ, we gain Christ, we are filled with Christ, and we are full of Christ.
[149]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE UNIQUE ONENESS FOR THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: John 10:16; 17:21-23; 1 Cor 1:5, 7a, 10-13, 22-24; 2:1-2; Eph 4:3-6; Titus 3:10
[150]  In the previous chapters we saw the building of God.
[151]  In verse 16 the Lord Jesus said, "And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold."
[152]  Dropping the Divisive Things and Coming Back to Christ
[153]  In the spring of 1963 after I was first sent by the Lord to minister in the United States, I was invited to speak to three Brethren assemblies.
[154]  John 17:23 says, "I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one."
[155]  ONENESS BY CARING ONLY FOR CHRIST IN 1 CORINTHIANS Caring for Christ, Not Knowledge or Gifts
[156]  The Corinthian believers were rich in all utterance and in all knowledge, and they did not lack any gift 1 Cor 1:5-7 .
[157]  In other words, they had all the utterance, they had all the knowledge, and they had all the gifts.
[158]  On the one hand, this is wonderful, but on the other hand, they were divided by the knowledge and gifts v. 10 . They were divided because they were too much in the teachings and the gifts.
[159]  In 1 Corinthians 1:10 Paul says, "Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion."
[160]  Recovering the Genuine Oneness by Dropping Everything Other Than Christ
[161]  The Lord's recovery today is the recovery of the genuine oneness, the oneness of Christ.
[162]  The Lord is going to recover us out of the teachings, out of the gifts, and out of the opinions back to Himself.
[163]  We do not have natural friendship; rather, we are one in Christ, by Christ, with Christ, and for Christ."
[164]  THE GROUND OF LOCALITY BEING FOR ONENESS NOT FOR DIVISION
[165]  I regret to say that some of the saints who have read our publications concerning the ground of locality have used them to cause division.
[166]  Some have said that they are taking the ground of locality in a certain city and that they do not want to have fellowship with others.
[167]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE ONENESS OF THE FAITH AND THE WINDS OF TEACHING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-14; Rev 2:2-4, 14-15, 20, 7, 17; 3:20
[168]  Ephesians 4:13-14 says, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error."
[169]  Whether or not we will be one in doctrines in the New Jerusalem, there is no possibility in this age for us all to be one in doctrine.
[170]  They all believed that the Bible is God's Word, that God is triune, that He is our Father, that Christ is the Son of God as well as the Son of Man becoming our Redeemer, and that Christ has a Body, the church.
[171]  We believe in the Bible, in God, in Christ, and in His redemptive work, and we also recognize that the church is uniquely one in this universe and in any locality.
[172]  The Teaching of Balaam and the Teaching of the Nicolaitans
[173]  Following the church in Ephesus, the other churches became more and more degraded by taking doctrines, such as the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans Rev 2:14-15 .
[174]  If today we are still for certain doctrines, sooner or later all the other doctrines will creep in. Because Christians were for doctrines, there was the ground for the doctrine of Balaam to creep in. If they had not been for doctrines, they would have said, "No, we don't care for this doctrine.
[175]  To the church in Thyatira the Lord Jesus said, "But I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices" v. 20 . The evil woman Jezebel was prophesied by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13:33.
[176]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE RECOVERY OF GOD'S BUILDING 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:6, 9b, 12; 1 Pet 2:2-5; Eph 2:21-22; 4:11-16; Col 2:19; Rom 12:2, 5 GOD'S WORK OF CREATION AND BUILDING
[177]  As we have seen, the two ends of the Bible reflect each other.
[178]  What is there at the beginning is also there at the end. At the beginning of the Bible there was the tree of life, and at the end of the Bible we have the same tree of life.
[179]  The building is the ultimate consummation not only in the entire Bible but also in all the Epistles, including those written by Paul, Peter, and John.
[180]  Then Romans shows us that regardless of how much we are justified through the blood of Christ, we were born in Adam, so we still have the old nature, but by God's grace we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ.
[181]  The building is the ultimate point of all the Epistles written by the apostles.
[182]  Concerning the building, we must not care for what people say.
[183]  BUILDING THE CHURCH BY COMING BACK TO THE PROPER GROUND
[184]  Today there are about thirteen million Jews on the earth.
[185]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE RECOVERY OF GOD'S BUILDING 2 Scripture Reading: Ezra 1:3, 5, 7, 11; 2:1; 3:1-6, 8-13; 4:1-5; 5:1-2 A FULL TYPE OF THE CHURCH
[186]  In this message we come to a wonderful point that we call the Lord's recovery.
[187]  Ezra is a book of recovery, and today we also are in the time of recovery.
[188]  THE LORD'S NEED FOR A RECOVERY, NOT A REVIVAL
[189]  Now we must see what the Lord's recovery is.
[190]  THE RECOVERY BEING WITH THE SMALL AND LESS SPIRITUAL ONES
[191]  We praise the Lord that there was a response to the Lord's call.
[192]  THE RECOVERY BEING SMALL IN SCALE BUT RIGHT IN PRINCIPLE
[193]  COMING OUT OF OUR OPINIONS AND TEACHINGS AND BACK TO OUR SPIRIT
[194]  If we are still in the mind, we will be divided, but now we are in the spirit.
[195]  THE NEED FOR THE ALTAR, ALERTNESS, AND THE PROPHETS
[196]  The returned ones did not firstly rebuild the temple; they firstly rebuilt the altar Ezra 3:1-6 .
[197]  In order to have the rebuilding of the church life, we need first to have an absolute consecration.
[198]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE NEW MAN AND THE MAN-CHILD Scripture Reading: Rev 2:7, 17, 26-27; 3:12, 20-22; 12:5; 17:3-5; 18:2a, 4; 19:7-9; 22:1-2a, 14, 17
[199]  As we saw in chapter one, the eternal purpose of God is to have a corporate man to express Him and represent Him.
[200]  However, just as the first man failed God, so this new man also failed God.
[201]  The first man was a failure; the second man was a success, but the new man again became a failure.
[202]  As the One who cares for the churches, Christ speaks as the Spirit to the many saints who have become degraded in order to call the overcomers to overcome the degraded situation of the church.
[203]  THE DEGRADATION OF THE CHURCH Leaving the First Love toward the Lord
[204]  Now we must see how the church as the new man became degraded.
[205]  According to the first of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3, the church left the first love toward the Lord 2:4 .
[206]  The church turned from the Lord Himself to something that was for the Lord but not the Lord Himself.
[207]  On the positive side, the Lord Jesus mentions our eating of Him at least three times.
[208]  Revelation 2:7 says, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life."
[209]  Now we can see that there is no other way to overcome.
[210]  OVERCOMING FOR THE BUILDING Overcoming to Be Transformed Materials for the Building
[211]  The overcomers, who are the eaters of Jesus, are the right materials for God's building.
