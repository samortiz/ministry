   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It was the same with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He said, "For I could wish that I myself were a curse, separated from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh" Rom 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If Israel could not be saved, he would rather lose his own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These were not just words on his lips, nor were they an outburst of his emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The pressure of a need gave him such a feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many times people imitate the prayers of others, but there is no power, and the prayers are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is because there is no pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Has anyone ever prayed, "God, if You will not answer me, I will not rise up"?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you have such feelings, and you utter such words, God will surely answer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps some will go home and say the same words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That is not what is important; what is important is to feel the pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was a very good believer in Tsinan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had a brother who always opposed and ridiculed him in his school class.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Last year when I was working at his school, I talked with the unbelieving brother, but he would not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His brother used to testify about the Lord very often on the campus and help many others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But one time he stopped testifying and the smile left his face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Another believer told me about his situation when I was there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They were afraid that he was discouraged and backslidden, and they hoped that I could render him some help.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although I met with him several times, he would quickly walk away after we exchanged a few words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was surprised that he was trying to avoid me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a conversation with another believer, I was told that there was nothing wrong with him except that his brother had not yet been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He would no longer testify unless his brother was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The conversation was concluded with the comment: "Although this is what he said, I wonder if there is some other hidden reason."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After our last meeting, I talked with the discouraged brother again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I asked him what was the reason for his recent behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He answered, "If God will not save my brother, I will never testify of the Lord again."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I realized that he had a special burden for his brother and was greatly pressured.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There could be only two reasons for his situation: either the enemy had deceived and discouraged him from working and advancing, or God intended to save his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If God had given him this pressure and was causing him to pray in such a desperate way, his brother would surely be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the pressure on him was too great; he could not get through.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That is why he had this kind of reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Immediately after I returned home, I received a letter from another brother at that school, telling me that this person's brother was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not long after I left, the unbelieving brother had become very sick.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he decided to receive the Lord, and he recovered from his illness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can realize a principle from this brother's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before God listens to our prayer, He always puts a great pressure on us so that we have to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At first we did not have the power to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But with pressure, we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The stronger the pressure is from God, the more powerful our prayers will become.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, let us learn the lesson that pressure produces power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The purpose of pressure is not to oppress us, but to afford us the opportunity to turn it into power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we can understand why God listens to some prayers, but not to others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can understand why God listens to prayers concerning big things, but not to prayers concerning small things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why does God listen to your oppressed prayer when someone you love, either a friend or co-worker, is very sick?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why does God not immediately answer your prayer when you have a headache, flu, or cut?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As I have said before, every prayer that does not touch you can never touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is altogether a problem of power, and power is always determined by pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why does God allow difficult things, unsolvable things, and unavoidable things to happen to us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The only reason that God allows these things to come to us is so that we will use the pressure to gain the power to seek for God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our failure lies in the fact that we do not know how to turn our pressure into power.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We know that all pressures have a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not have to wait until we are pressed beyond measure before we begin to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to learn to pray with pressure and without pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, if there is pressure, we should turn it into power.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we turn every pressure into power, we will see that pressure comes for the purpose of manifesting God's power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No power is greater than the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are pressed, and things are hopeless on all sides, we will clearly feel the power of resurrection rising up within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I were to ask how many times our prayers were answered during our lifetime, every one of us could recall at least some prayers that have been answered.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why were those prayers answered?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Is it not because the pressure was too great, that we were not able to get through, and that we poured out our hearts to God and He listened?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps we had never fasted before that time.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But on that day we found that we had to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We felt that we were forced to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We found that prayer was no longer a burden, but the removal of a burden.</S>
