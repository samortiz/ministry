   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>g. His Coming in Power, Majesty, and Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>as the Beloved Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revealed on the Holy Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to bring us into the eternal kingdom, Christ will come in power, majesty, and glory as the beloved Son of God revealed on the holy mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verses 16 through 18 say, We did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we became eyewitnesses of that One s majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For He received from God the Father honor and glory, a voice such as this being borne to Him by the magnificent glory: This is My Son, My Beloved, in whom I delight.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And this voice we heard being borne out of heaven while we were with Him in the holy mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Myths were the superstitious stories cleverly devised in Greek philosophy, which was related to the apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The apostles preached and taught concerning the power and coming Gk. parousia, presence of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To unbelievers, the preaching concerning the Lord s coming sounded very much like a myth or a superstitious tale.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But here Peter says that the apostles did not follow cleverly devised myths when they made known the power and coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning the word eyewitnesses, Darby comments, Admitted into immediate vision of the glory, a word used for full initiation into the mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter realized that he, James, and John had been admitted into the highest degree of initiation at the Lord s transfiguration, admitted to be the initiated spectators of His majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He considered the transfiguration of the Lord a figure of His second coming, even as the Lord did in Luke 9:26-36.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord s transfiguration in glory was a fact, and he was in it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s coming back in glory also will be a fact, as real as the Lord s transfiguration, and he will be in it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter says that the apostles became eyewitnesses of the Lord s majesty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This majesty denotes magnificence, greatness in splendor, honor, and glory, even magnificent glory 2 Pet 1:17 , as that which appeared to the eyes of Peter and the other two disciples in the Lord s transfiguration Matt 17:1-2; Luke 9:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 2 Peter 1:16 Peter indicates that the Lord Jesus will come back in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not a tale or a myth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even when He was on earth, the glory came out of Him, and He was transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peter, James, and John saw His majesty when they were with Him on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were eyewitnesses and were initiated into a vision of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 17 tells us that Christ received from God the Father honor and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Honor is a matter of position, and glory is a matter of state.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the Mount of Transfiguration, the Lord was in a position of honor and in a state of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter says that a voice was borne to the Lord by the magnificent glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This magnificent glory denotes the overshadowing cloud at the Lord s transfiguration Luke 9:34-35 , like the shekinah glory overshadowing the expiation cover Exo 25:20; 40:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we read the accounts in Matthew, Mark, and Luke concerning the Lord s transfiguration, we will see that the magnificent glory in 2 Peter 1:17 refers to the overshadowing cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Peter, James, and John saw the cloud, and that cloud was the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, after the tabernacle had been erected in ancient times, it was filled with the glory of God, for the cloud of God s glory overshadowed the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It would have been difficult to discern the cloud from the glory, because the cloud was with the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>111.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Master</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Second Peter 2:1 says, There arose also false prophets among the people, as also among you there will be false teachers, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here Peter speaks of Christ as the Master who bought the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The word Master implies the Lord s person and His redemptive work Jude 4; 2 Tim 2:21; Rev 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The false teachers at Peter s time, like today s modernists in their apostasy, denied both the person of the Lord as the Master and His redemption, by which the Lord purchased the believers Acts 20:28; 1 Cor 6:20; 7:23; Rev 5:9; 14:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The false teachers despised the lordship of Christ and were made slaves of corruption 2 Pet 2:10, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In contrast to the false teachers, we need to escape the defilements of the world by the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ v. 20 . This indicates the importance of having the full knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the Master who bought us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>112.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Element of Our Growth</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 2 Peter 3:18, Peter tells us to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This verse reveals Christ as the element of our growth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word grow in verse 18 indicates that what Peter wrote in his two Epistles is a matter of life 1 Pet 2:2; Eph 4:15; Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To grow in grace is to grow by the bountiful supply of eternal life provided by the divine power 2 Pet 1:3-4 , and to grow in the knowledge of the Lord is to grow by the realization of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is to grow by the enjoyment of grace and the realization of truth John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Grace is the Triune God being life and the life supply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to grow in this life supply, in this nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, to grow in grace means to grow in this inward source of the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the beginning of this Epistle, Peter speaks of grace, and now at the end he charges us to grow in this grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Grace is God Himself with divinity processed through incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All these elements of grace are within us to be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Grace is God Himself as our life to be one with us, to save us, to make His home in us, and to be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To grow in grace is to grow in the increase of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Grace is God s visitation to us to stay in us and make Himself one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to grow in such a grace for His glory today and unto the day of eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Second Peter 3:18 is the concluding word of the apostle Peter s writings, indicating that whatever he has written is of, in, by, and through the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 18 tells us to grow in the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that to grow is by the feeding and watering, as revealed by Peter in 1 Peter 2:2 and by Paul in 1 Corinthians 3:2 and 6.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To grow in grace is to grow in the enjoyment of all that Christ is to us as our spiritual food and living water.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the riches of what Christ is to us are for our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more we enjoy the riches of Christ Eph 3:8 , the more we will grow in life 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peter also encourages us to grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The realization of the knowledge of our Lord equals truth, the reality of all that He is, as in John 1:14 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Peter charged the believers to grow not only in grace but also in this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The full knowledge of Jesus Christ, knowing Christ in a deeper and fuller way, helps us to grow and develop.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Both in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the believers should grow unto His glory both now and unto the day of eternity.</S>
