   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This issue will be the last issue of this magazine for this year.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Next year we will continue to publish this paper, and we will continue to distribute it free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But our hope is that every copy will fall into the hands of those who really want to read it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, we have the following requests:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 We ask all those who would like to read it to please continue to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 Those who do not want to read it should please write to us to stop mailing it to them next year.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Also, please give us the code number on the wrapping.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You are not embarrassing us by telling us to stop mailing; rather, you are helping us to save some wasted efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We thank God that Brother Watchman Nee's health has been greatly blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He does not have any plan of his own; he is looking to God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Next year he will be able to meet with the readers through these columns again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By then we will also say something concerning the work ahead and our condition here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We ask the concerned brothers and sisters to thank God for us and to continue to pray for us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All our publications which are marked Not for Sale are free for reprints and extracts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we ask those who are reprinting or making extracts of our writings not to sell them at a price or print them in regularly-priced publications.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They must also be Not for Sale items.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Back issues of this paper and back issues of Notes on Scriptural Messages are out of stock; we have given them all away.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who have them should keep them well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We apologize for not being able to make up the missing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May God bless you!</S>
