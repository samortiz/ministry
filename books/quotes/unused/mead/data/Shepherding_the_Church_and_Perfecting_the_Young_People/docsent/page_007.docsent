   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT RESTRICTING THE LORD S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although it is not appropriate for the elders to choke the workers so severely, the co-workers should be choke-proof.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A brother who serves in a locality should not stop doing something simply because he feels that the elders are not fully supportive.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders should not control him, but the brother should still be able to coordinate with the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the elders should not direct him in his service, whether it is giving messages, working with young people, working on the campuses, or contacting saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While the elders should not restrict the co-workers, the co-workers should not blame the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Instead, the co-workers should supply others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the co-workers have something, they will supply life in the meetings, and whenever they open their mouths, the saints will be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Who would restrict the co-workers if they supply the saints?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The co-workers should always have the supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They should be like a river.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The co-workers should forget about any restrictions and instead have a ready supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would advise the elders to administrate less but exercise discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They should see whether a brother has a genuine supply.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a brother has the supply, he should be encouraged to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The brothers can testify that our work has never restricted the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the work there is only leading, supplying, and supporting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must reduce the administration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the church life no one is useless; rather, everyone is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In any case, a person s usefulness depends on whether or not he is used.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A co-worker should not allow himself to be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the very least, he can preach the gospel to one person a day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He can distribute two hundred tracts every day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are useless, we bear the blame.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not say that we are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even a person who is mute and cannot speak can distribute tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The co-workers have many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A co-worker with no function has not developed his function.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is not good for the co-workers to delegate everything to others and then merely attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The co-workers should never be useless; instead, they should always advance and look for opportunities to develop their function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No saint is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be useless means that we have not worked to develop our function.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not blame our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must develop our function.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord s work cannot be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s work cannot be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is always work to do.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must labor to the extent that all the saints are stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>LETTING THE SAINTS WORK</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must have a long-range view.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must have a change of concept and let go of any thought of controlling the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church life will not become worse from a lack of control.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Twenty years ago I would not have dared to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, today I can say this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not control out of fear that the saints will make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Last year in Los Angeles three young top serving brothers volunteered to labor with the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more they worked, the less the young people came to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One day they came to fellowship with me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I told them that they should no longer work with the young ones; rather, they should let students work with students.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I also said that those who are not in school should not work with students.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, the work with the young saints was put into the hands of the students.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I even told the elders not to check how the students work was progressing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even in a young people s conference during the Thanksgiving holidays, the young students bore the responsibility of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before the conference, the young saints heard that no one would be overseeing the conference, and they were afraid that they might make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So a few of them made a plan for the conference and brought it to me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Instead of reviewing their plan, I told them to hold the conference and that it would not matter if they made mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I can testify that that young people s conference was blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The young people did an excellent job.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This subdued the brothers who were ambitious to work with the students.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The young people are qualified to take care of other young people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The young ones who thought they were incapable of doing a good work were quite capable in the end. We later asked the young people to take care of another conference, and two hundred and twenty-five young people were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should let go and let the saints serve.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should be bold and let them do the work.</S>
