   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE A CHILD OF BOTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE DIVINE AND HUMAN NATURES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BORN OF A HUMAN VIRGIN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND A SON IN THE DIVINE NATURE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GIVEN BY THE ETERNAL FATHER Scripture Reading: Isa 7:14; 9:6-7; Matt 1:20, 23, 21; John 3:16</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message we come to two of the greatest prophecies in the Bible concerning Christ, recorded in Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These prophecies speak of a child born and a son given.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word child in these verses implies God, implies man, implies God becoming a man, and implies God and man mingled together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a child was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This child of both the divine and human natures born of a human virgin was also a son given in the divine nature by the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first poetic pair of items revealed concerning Christ in the book of Isaiah is that He is the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The second pair of items concerning Christ is an issue of the first pair.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This pair is Christ as the covering canopy of glory and the overshadowing tabernacle of grace 4:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are covered under the glory and we are overshadowed by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ as grace is a tabernacle overshadowing us, and Christ as glory is a canopy covering us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of the riches of Christ seen in Isaiah are not pointed out in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul's writings, for example, do not speak of Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Christ whom Paul ministered to us and helped us to pursue is God's Shoot to branch out God and the Fruit of the earth for His multiplication and reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's branching out was for Him to spread Himself from and with divinity into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In eternity past and before the incarnation, He was merely in the territory of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then through His incarnation, He branched out into another territory, the territory of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second revelation Isaiah saw concerning Christ was that of Christ in His divine glory with His human virtues held in His holiness 6:1-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His divine glory is signified by the smoke, His human virtues are signified by the train of His robe, and His holiness is held by the seraphim.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Isaiah was sent by the Christ who is full of the divine glory and the human virtues in His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this message we come to the third major revelation of Christ in Isaiah, seen in 7:14 and 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This pair of items of Christ is a child born of a human virgin and a son given by the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Isaiah 7:14 says, "Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah 9:6 says, "For a child is born to us, a son is given to us; and the government is upon His shoulders; and His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The child born in 9:6 is the One born of a virgin and called Immanuel in 7:14.</S>
