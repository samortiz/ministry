   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Twelve</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Twelve is an eternal number.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Seven is the dispensational completion or temporal completion; only twelve is the eternal perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Seven is four plus three, the creature man joined to the Creator God .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Twelve is four times three, the creature man mingled with the Creator God .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Seven represents man and God joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Twelve signifies that God bestows grace on man and receives him so that the creature is mingled in with the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, seven represents dispensational perfection, and twelve represents eternal perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The former indicates the contact between the creature and the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although it is complete, it is temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The latter indicates the mingling of the creature with the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not only complete but eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We ought to know that both seven and twelve are derived from the numbers four and three.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whereas seven is the sum of these two numbers, twelve is the product of these two numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Addition means that two numbers are parallel; they are put together.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Multiplication means that they are mingled together into one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The meaning of multiplication is deeper than addition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, one is eternal, and the other is temporal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the creature and the Creator are put together, there is completion, but there is still the distinction between the eternal and the temporal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we can see the importance of mingling with God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are twelve months to a year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There were twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There were twelve precious stones on the breastplate of the high priest Exo 28:21 .</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There were twelve springs at Elim Exo 15:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There were twelve men that were sent to spy out the land Num 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Joshua put twelve stones into the Jordan River Josh 4:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Elijah took twelve stones and built an altar 1 Kings 18:31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Solomon used twelve brass oxen upon which the molten sea was set 1 Kings 7:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus went to Jerusalem when He was twelve years old Luke 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He chose twelve apostles and promised that they would sit upon twelve thrones to judge the twelve tribes of Israel Matt 19:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He healed a woman who had an issue of blood for twelve years Luke 8:43-44 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He raised Jairus' daughter who was twelve years old Luke 8:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He took five loaves and two fishes to feed the multitude of five thousand, and the fragments that remained were twelve baskets full Matt 14:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He had the power to pray to the Father who would present twelve legions of angels to save Him Matt 26:53 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Revelation, we can see that the number twelve is used more than in any other book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The woman has a crown with twelve stars on her head Rev 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Jerusalem has twelve gates of twelve pearls Rev 21:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are twelve angels at the gates v. 12 , and the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel are written thereon v. 12 . The wall of the city has twelve foundations and on them are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb v. 14 . The tree of life bears twelve kinds of fruit 22:2 . There is one thing that deserves our attention: in the eternal kingdom of the new heaven and new earth, all the numbers are twelve; there is no seven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The first part of Revelation uses the number seven many times when it speaks of the situation of the temporary age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the eternal kingdom, twelve is used.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This proves even further that seven is the temporal perfection and twelve is the eternal perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Bible there are many other significant numbers, but according to our need today, these numbers are enough.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we review the meanings of the relationships between these numbers, we will see more wonderful things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the Bible, one to seven is a cycle of numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we look carefully we will see that their sequence is also meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the other numbers in the Bible are derived from the multiplication and addition of these seven numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the Bible these seven numbers are the base of all numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before we continue we should see one thing, that is, although all the numbers have their own meaning, their denotation can be either good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the number is to refer to God, it is good; if it is to refer to man, it is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Numbers one, two, and three represent God's completion the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God ought to be before all the numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God ought to have the first place in all things, otherwise, we will see failure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Four is the symbol of the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the Bible, four is composed of three and one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Four is the first number after three.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Three represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Four represents what comes out from God, that is, every created being.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, four is the number of the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here we see the relationship between the creature and the Creator: the creature comes out of the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is pitiful that men do not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Besides the creature and the Creator, there is nothing else in the universe; therefore, three plus four is a complete number; all the other numbers are based on this.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Five, six, and seven are based on four.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One, two, and three are the first three of the seven numbers; they represent the greatness of the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Four is the middle number of seven, and it represents the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Five, six, and seven are the last three of the seven numbers; they represent the condition of the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Five is four plus one, six is four plus two, and seven is four plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's number is only three.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Man's number is only four.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The relationship between God's number and man's number goes only to seven four plus three .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Therefore, seven is a complete number.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Five is four plus one which indicates that the creature four is the antithesis of the Creator one .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In another sense, five is four plus one, meaning that the creature is before the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Hence, it has the meaning of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although the Creator is merciful, that does not mean that man's responsibility is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, all the numbers that have five in them such as ten, forty, etc., denote responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Six is four plus two.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It indicates how the creatures four are in want and always disputing two .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It also indicates how they four receive help and deliverance two .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, six indicates the real situation of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Seven is four plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It indicates the creatures four being well accepted by the Creator three .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Seven is a complete number.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we read the numbers that God shows us in the Bible, we have to praise Him for His wisdom and admire His wonderful teaching and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After we know the overall meaning of the numbers, whenever we read Revelation, we will see new meanings in connection with the numbers in the book.</S>
