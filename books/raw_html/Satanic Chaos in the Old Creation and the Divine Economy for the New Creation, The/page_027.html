<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>e. The Word of God Growing<br>and the Number of the Disciples Multiplying Greatly</H2><P>According to the record in the book of Acts, the word of God grew, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly (6:7; 12:24; 19:20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. The Disciples Being Scattered<br>from Jerusalem to Preach the Gospel<br>throughout the Regions of Judea and Samaria</H2><P>The disciples were scattered from Jerusalem throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. Those who were scattered went throughout the land preaching the gospel (Acts 8:1, 4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. The Gospel Spreading under Peter's Ministry</H2><P>In Acts 9:32-43 we see that the gospel spread under Peter's ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. The Gospel, through Paul's Ministry,<br>Spreading to the Gentile World,<br>and Many Churches Being Raised Up</H2><P>Through Paul's ministry the gospel spread to the Gentile world, and many churches were raised up (Acts 13&#151;28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>i. The Churches Raised Up through Paul's Ministry<br>Being Strengthened and Corrected<br>under John's Ministry</H2><P>The Epistles of 1, 2, and 3 John and the book of Revelation show us that the churches raised up through Paul's ministry were strengthened and corrected under John's ministry.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Satanic Chaos</H2><P>Again the satanic chaos was unavoidable and went along with the divine economy in the ministry of the apostles. This chaos includes twenty-six items.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Jewish Religion and the Roman Government<br>Persecuting the Apostles and the Church</H2><P>The Jewish religion and the Roman government persecuted the apostles and the church (Acts 4:1-3, 5-6; 7:57&#151;8:3; 12:1-4; 16:22-24). Religion and politics often collaborate to persecute and damage the Lord's interest on earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Ananias and Sapphira Deceiving the Spirit<br>and Being Punished to Death</H2><P>In Acts 5:1-11 Ananias, a brother, and his wife Sapphira deceived the Spirit and were punished to death in the presence of the church. That surely was something of chaos.</P>
