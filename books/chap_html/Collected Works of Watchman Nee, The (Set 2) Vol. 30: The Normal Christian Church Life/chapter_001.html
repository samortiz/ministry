<h1 class="msg">PREFACE</h1><p>The contents of Volume 30 of The Collected Works, with the exception of some minor adjustments to British punctuation, expressions, idioms, and spellings, have been taken directly from the edition published by Watchman Nee in England in 1939 under the title Concerning Our Missions. The 1939 English edition presents Watchman Nee's own work in the English language; he was directly responsible for its translation and editing. Any differences between the English and Chinese editions reflect Watchman Nee's own revisions. The contents of Volume 30 have been published separately by Living Stream Ministry under the title The Normal Christian Church Life.</p>
