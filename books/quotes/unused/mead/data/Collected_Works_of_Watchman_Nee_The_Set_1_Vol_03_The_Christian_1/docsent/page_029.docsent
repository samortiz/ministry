   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The firmament separated the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The cross of the Lord Jesus separated the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When He was crucified, His cross forever separated the two thieves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One went to Paradise, and the other went to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Throughout their lives, the two had been sinning together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But during their last few minutes, one received the substitutional death of the cross of the Lord Jesus, and the other refused to accept.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There was a separation of heaven and hell!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This separation lasts forever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His cross separated the two thieves then, and in the same way it separates the whole world today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, this separation does not happen only today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Throughout history His cross has separated all the people in the world into two kinds: the saved ones and perishing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"For the word of the cross is to those who are perishing foolishness, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God" 1 Cor 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The cross divides salvation and perdition for man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The separation of perishing ones and the saved ones is based on nothing other than their attitude toward the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only the firmament can separate the waters that are above from the waters that are beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the same way only the cross can divide perishing ones and saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, the firmament separates the waters that are above from the waters that are beneath so that the waters above cannot come down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The firmament stands in the middle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It prevents the waters above from coming down and mixing with the waters beneath, which would make them once again without form and void, and return them to the desolate condition of God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have seen from Revelation 17 that the waters on the earth are a type of the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The waters above, however, typify something else.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of Noah the world fell into sin, and God judged it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He sent the rain and opened up the window of heaven, pouring down the waters from above.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From this we see that the waters above are a type of the wrath, punishment, and judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this is true, it is not hard to find the meaning of the firmament.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The firmament holds back the waters above so that they will not come down to the waters beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It stands between the waters above and the waters beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He stood in our place and bore our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The judgment, punishment, and wrath of God should have fallen upon and desolated us, making us the "deep."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the Lord Jesus stood between us and God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When He was crucified on the cross, He allowed God's wrath to fall on Him and not on us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to God's ordination, the wrath of God should abide upon us John 3:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But He has established Him as the bearer of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him" Isa 53:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thank the Lord for the firmament in the heaven that separates the waters above from the waters beneath!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thank the Lord for the cross of the Lord Jesus which separates the world from the wrath of God!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet He has borne what we should have borne ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the waters above are not separated from the waters beneath, the world would forever perish under water.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the Lord Jesus had not borne God's wrath on behalf of man, the world would forever be in desolation and hopelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the substitutional work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The firmament was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The decision was made by God, and the creation was also accomplished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Superficially, the Lord Jesus was crucified by the Jews and killed by the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seems that His life was taken by men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to the Bible, however, He was not killed because He said that no one could take His life away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His death was the judgment of God upon Him for all the sins of the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>/ When He makes Himself an offering for sin" Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The cross was God's direct work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was not men who ill-treated Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible says, "This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to a cross and killed" Acts 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Among the six days of God's work, He considered that His work during all the other days was good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This was the only day when God did not say that what He had made was good.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What God has not said is as meaningful as what He has said.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The work on the second day was God's dealing with sin on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's wrath was manifested on the righteous One for the purpose of releasing the unrighteous ones.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was there that God made the sinless One sin for us and caused Him to suffer the punishment for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is very meaningful that He did not say that it was good.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God takes no pleasure in judging sin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He loves to give grace; He does not like to judge.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The deliverance of the cross is the basis of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Without the substitution of the cross, Christ's birth is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The whole world has sinned, and the wages of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Unless there is a Savior who will die on the sinner's behalf, no one will escape the judgment he deserves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If there had been only the birth of Christ, it would have been completely useless in saving sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What man lacks is a sin-bearing Savior, not a holy teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only a vicarious Savior can deliver sinners from their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If there is no vicarious death, even resurrection will be useless, because without death there can be no resurrection and no need for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All the facts of salvation are based on the work of this day.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If the waters had not been separated, there would have been no possibility for the land to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Even the shining of the light on the previous day would have been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should pay attention to this matter and never forget that the Lord Jesus died on the cross for us.</S>
