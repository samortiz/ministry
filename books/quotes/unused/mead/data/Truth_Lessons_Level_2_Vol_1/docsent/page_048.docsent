   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Conditions for Receiving a Reward</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord will give us a reward according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It will not be given to us in the same way as salvation is given, according to grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since God s salvation is according to grace, we receive it freely.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, since the Lord s reward is according to righteousness, we must pay a considerable price to obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Scriptures contain many conditions for obtaining the reward, but in this lesson we will mention only the more important ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we will receive a reward according to our own labor 1 Cor 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the Lord s giving us a reward will be according to His righteousness, our obtaining the reward must be according to our own labor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After we are saved, if what we produce before the Lord is gold, silver, and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 , the Lord will give us a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Bible, gold refers to the divine nature Exo 25:11, 17-18, 24, 31 , silver, to redemption Exo 30:16 , and precious stones, to the expression of God s glorious image Rev 4:3; 21:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, a work which is of gold, silver, and precious stones is a work which is of God and which corresponds to God s nature, a work which is according to the principle of God s redemption, and a work which is able to express God, manifesting the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If what we produce is wood, grass, and stubble, which is of man, of the flesh, and full of the earthly element and condition, we will not receive a reward from the Lord; rather, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, we will receive a reward according to our work Rev 22:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows us that although receiving salvation does not require work, receiving a reward does.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether we will receive a reward from the Lord depends on whether we have the work that is pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a work is the surpassing righteousness that we live out by His life Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How great a reward we will receive from the Lord also depends on how much of our work is pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Third, we will receive a prize because we are faithful to the Lord unto death, not caring for our lives Rev 2:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The believers ability to be faithful unto death, overcoming Satan s infliction of death, is an issue of their living by Christ s resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of this, they will receive the crown of life to enjoy the glory of life and not be hurt by the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fourth, we will receive a reward because we overcome Rev 2:7, 10-11, 17, 26-27; 3:5, 11-12, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The overcoming that the Lord requires is the victory that we achieve in fighting against anything that opposes His testimony and damages His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord s testimony rests with the church that He loves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His intention is to bring in the kingdom He treasures through the church He loves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan knows this and has been trying his best to frustrate the Lord s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the Lord wants us to fight for this and to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since this overcoming is necessary to the bringing in of the Lord s kingdom, overcoming becomes indispensable to our receiving a prize and entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our overcoming includes the following items: recovering the first love toward the Lord; enduring persecution or tribulations to be faithful unto death; not mingling with the world, rejecting hierarchy, and leaving the worldly organization of Christianity; removing the heresies of the Roman Catholic Church and not being contaminated by the defilement of idols and spiritual fornication; overcoming coldness, deadness, and decline; striving to keep the word of the Lord s endurance and not denying His name; and not being self-satisfied, but humbly pursuing, opening our heart to let the Lord in to gain the ground in us and have fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these are conditions for receiving the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only the overcomers can enter into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens to be enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The defeated believers in the present dark and evil world will not be allowed to reign in the coming kingdom, which is of light and of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who are not able to be the overcomers in this age of desolation will not be able to be the rulers in the coming age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s ordination is that we must first fight and overcome, then we will reign.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Fifth, we will receive a reward because we love His appearing 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To love the Lord s appearing and to love the Lord Himself are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we truly love the Lord, we will love His appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All those who love the Lord and forsake everything for Him love also His appearing, that they may receive His reward; those who do not love the Lord, but love the world or love sin, are afraid of the Lord s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, loving the Lord s appearing is a proof that we love the Lord and live for Him today; hence, it also becomes a condition for us to receive His reward.</S>
