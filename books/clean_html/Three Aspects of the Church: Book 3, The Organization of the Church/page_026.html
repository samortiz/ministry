<h2 class="head4">Gifts Being Sustained in Grace</h2>
<p>Gifts are given according to and based upon the grace within. After a person has a gift, God needs to continue to supply that person with grace. This is what is spoken of in Ephesians 4. Grace is according to the measure of the gift. The Lord gives a person grace, produces a gift within him, and then supplies grace according to the gift in him. If a person&rsquo;s gift is great, God will supply him continually with a great amount of grace. If his gift is small, God will supply him continually with a small amount of grace. Thus, grace is given according to the measure of the gift. In order to exercise our gift, we need the supply of grace.</p>
<p>All those who minister the word can testify that they need a great supply of grace from God. Although to minister the word is not necessarily a great gift, neither is it a small gift. Hence, it requires much grace from God. It would be terrible if God gave us gifts without supplying us continually with grace. If God gave us ears but did not give us a supply of blood, our ears would be useless. Moreover, if the blood supplied to our shoulders was only equal to the supply to our ears, it would not be possible for the shoulders to function. The shoulders need much blood in order to function properly. Grace abounds in us according to the gifts that we have received. Grace is given to us according to the measure of our gifts.</p>
<p>The strength for a person to minister the word depends entirely on the inward anointing, supply of life, and presence of God&mdash;all of which are grace. I can testify that when I speak for the Lord, I am not afraid of not having anything to say. What I am afraid of is that when I am speaking, I may not be able to touch God inwardly. This is the most awful thing. If grace is gone, God is gone, and nothing is left within. It is most terrible for the inward source to be cut off and for there to be no supply of grace. However, it is wonderful when a person who has been appointed as God&rsquo;s mouthpiece opens his mouth and the supply within him begins to flow. As long as he is ministering the word for God, the grace and supply within him will come. The grace given by God to each one is according to the measure of the gift that he has received.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Gifts Being a Matter of Life and Spirituality</h2>
<p>Offices are a matter of authority, that is, of submitting ourselves to God. Gifts are a matter of grace, that is, of touching God, living in fellowship with God, and having the presence of God, the life supply, and the anointing. Gifts are produced from grace, and when we exercise our gifts, we need the supply of grace. Romans tells us that gifts come from grace, and Ephesians tells us that we need the supply of grace in order to exercise our gifts. Hence, we need grace both in the receiving of gifts and in the exercise of gifts. Without grace, there is no gift. If we have gifts but are without a continual supply of grace, we will not be able to exercise our gifts. The producing of gifts requires grace, and the exercise of gifts also requires grace. Gifts are produced and exercised through grace, and grace is related to life. Hence, when we touch life and exercise our gifts, all the problems are solved.</p>
<p>Offices are a matter of authority, and gifts are a matter of spirituality. Spirituality is a matter of grace, that is, a matter of life. Every gift comes from life, from the Spirit. The Spirit is the realization of God&rsquo;s life. Hence, only by living constantly in grace and in the anointing can one be spiritual. Grace and spirituality are inseparable.</p>
<p>If a saint constantly lives in fellowship with the Lord and is continually experiencing the supply of life and the anointing, a gift will surely be manifested in him. In contrast, if a person ceases to experience grace and loses his fellowship with the Lord, he will have no anointing, no supply, and no manifestation of gift. If a brother is weak and depressed, his function will not be manifested. However, once he is enlivened, the gift within him will immediately be manifested without his having received any teaching. Formerly, he may not have been willing to give hospitality, but after praying and contacting the Lord, he may have the burden and willingness to pay the price and to joyfully provide hospitality to saints from afar.</p>
<p>Likewise, a brother may cease meeting for a long period of time and have no inward fellowship with the Lord. Being severed from grace, He does not have a heart to love the Lord. Although He may attend meetings occasionally, he does so out of duty and has absolutely no heart for the service or administration of the church. One day, however, he may touch the Lord inwardly, receive grace, and be revived. Later, when he stands up in a meeting and gives a testimony, many saints may have a response in their spirit, saying, &ldquo;This brother will one day be an elder.&rdquo; Even though he was revived only recently, his gift, that is, his care for people and for the church, his insight, and his orderly handling of matters may immediately be manifested. In other words, the brother definitely has a gift, and this gift comes from grace.</p>
<p>Another brother, after being saved for five years, may not be clear regarding spiritual matters; however, he may be able to speak clearly and reasonably about many secular topics, including philosophy, aesthetics, politics, or economics. One day he may touch the Lord in a meeting and receive grace. Three weeks later he may give a testimony in a meeting. Upon hearing him speak, many may sense that he has the gift of ministering the word. Even though his testimony is about how he was saved and gained by the Lord, his speaking is nonetheless an excellent message that inspires people. He is able to do this because he has enjoyed grace and has a gift for ministering the word.</p>
<p>Gifts come from grace. In the church even sweeping the floor is a gift. When we live in grace, it is impossible not to manifest the gifts that we have received (Rom. 12). For instance, when a person touches the Lord, he may receive grace to wipe the windows and to clean the meeting hall on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. The reason he does these things is not that certain ones have asked him to; rather, he does these things because of the gift within him. If he does not function according to his gift, he will feel uneasy for the entire week. This is a gift.</p>
<p>Grace enables us to manifest our gifts; thus, we should never forget that we need a continual supply of grace in order to exercise these gifts. According to Ephesians 4, the amount of grace we receive depends entirely on the measure of gift we have received.</p>
