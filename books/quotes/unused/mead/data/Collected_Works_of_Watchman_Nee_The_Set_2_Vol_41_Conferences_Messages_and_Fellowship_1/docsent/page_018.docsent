   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT ACCORDING TO ANY FORM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is no need to adhere to any form when reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some have asked how I live.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I answered that I live in a very nonrigid fashion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes I visit people at midnight.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes others visit me at six o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The same should be true with our reading of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must follow the Spirit, not the form.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>REACHING GOD'S STANDARD</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When most people think of sanctification, they think of the negative aspect of deliverance from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But biblical sanctification is toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Being sanctified is being separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Once we lay hold of the source, the other negative things will be dealt with easily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the source of sanctification is God Himself, all the sins will be dealt with easily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our view must be elevated to God's standard.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even in saving men, our center should be God, not man, because God wants to gain many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we should work to save men, not because they are suffering, but because God wants to have sons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our work is man-centered, we will not be able to sleep well when we get to heaven because we will see others still in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some mothers will not be able to say "hallelujah" in heaven when they see their children in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing of what we do should be earth-centered, and nothing should be self-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everything should be divine and God-centered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>WAITING FOR THE LORD'S COMING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When I first read Sister Dora Yu's book, The Prayer Life, and saw two chapters on the Lord's coming, I was stirred up to study the prophecies in Daniel and Revelation very much.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later I met Miss M.E. Barber, who did not talk about the prophecies of the Lord's coming at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I was very proud and thought that I understood much about prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet in the course of our conversation, I found that she was the one who was truly waiting for the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My studying was genuine, but my waiting was not.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I studied about the Lord's coming, but I was not waiting for it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, she not only studied the prophecies of the Lord's coming, but she was genuinely waiting for it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Her studying and her waiting were both genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE NEED FOR EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In 1922 Miss Barber explained the book, More Than Conquerors, by Jessie Penn-Lewis to me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She often said, "We need her to tell us about her experience of the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I was quite puzzled and could not understand what she was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later I gradually learned that a man does not need the doctrine of victory and of being more than conquerors, but the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A man will have the genuine experience of victory only after he has accepted the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Western missionary who was over forty years old could not overcome a certain habit of snacking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She wept about it for two weeks, but was still unable to overcome the sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every meeting she came with tears in her eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I asked her for the reason, and she told me that she had committed some very serious sins.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I asked about it, she told me that she could not overcome concerning certain kinds of food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She was sorrowful because she could not overcome when she saw that many others had experienced the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Later, I talked with her about the secret to victory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When she went home, she committed the matter to the Lord, and the Lord brought her through.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She later testified that during that week she was so exuberant that she did not know if she was living on earth or in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later, I found that she fasted more than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She fasted once or twice a week and sometimes fasted for over twenty consecutive days.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Romans 7 can be called a chapter of desperation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This chapter tells us that a man must give up hope in himself before he can overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a man has not reached his end, God will not begin His work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In America a believer had a frame on his wall that read "Let God."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He prayed to "let God" do many things for him, but failed again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One day either the wind or some naughty children took away the letter "d" in the word God, and only "Let Go" was left!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>These two simple words helped him to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>GENUINE SPIRITUALITY</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a meeting renders others a spiritual supply, that meeting has spiritual worth to it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When others attend your meeting, they can only receive the supply which you already have.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Others can never receive more than your capacity to give.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In spiritual matters, it is a matter of whether or not we have the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are spiritual, we are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we are not spiritual, we are not spiritual; there is no way for us to perform anything.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If someone has accomplished something that has spiritual value to it, there is no need for us to be jealous of him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Brethren are sound in theology, and they can analyze doctrines well, yet there is not much spiritual worth to their work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First Corinthians 8:2 says, "If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has not yet come to know as he ought to know."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To think that one knows anything is spiritual pride.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who think that they know anything actually have nothing, yet they presume that they have something.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>My Bible is very clean because every time I read it or speak about it, I forget what I read or spoke, and put it behind me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this way, I am not tempted to speak from memory at a later date when the light is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once we have delivered a message, we should try not to ever repeat it again, unless we have more light on it at a later date.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>GENUINE LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whether or not you can love a person depends on your knowledge of him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>First, you have to know how much he loves you, and then you have to know why he is so lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once you know these things, you will love him willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>True love is having no complaint in the midst of sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If you love your father, you will be happy when he chastises you for your mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will wish that he chastised you more, if that will make his heart happy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Once a brother said to me, "If you love a person, you will be happy even if he rebukes you."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Love suffers willingly for the sake of rendering joy to others.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is true between friends and between fathers and sons.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is also true between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Hence, the more we know the Lord, the more we will love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In order to know the Lord, we have to know His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord's Word is simply the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Through the Lord's Word, we know how He loves us and how lovable He is.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This knowledge will attract us to love Him and follow Him willingly.</S>
