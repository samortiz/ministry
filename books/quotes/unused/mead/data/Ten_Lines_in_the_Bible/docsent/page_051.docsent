   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This refers to the Judaizers mixing things of Judaism with the gospel of the Lord Jesus, causing people to be partly in Christianity and partly in Judaism, partly in grace and partly in the law, and partly relying on the Lord Jesus and partly relying on themselves.</S>
