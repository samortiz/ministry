   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"YOU ALSO OUGHT TO WASH ONE ANOTHER'S FEET"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 14 the Lord said, "If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord washed the disciples' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today He wants us to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The washing of sins by the blood is God's work, whereas the washing of feet by the water is man's work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has not charged us to wash the whole body; He only charges us to wash the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot give others a bath, because we cannot redeem them from their sins; we cannot save anyone or cause anyone to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The work of salvation is God's work alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our only responsibility is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, the Lord wants to wash man's feet today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This washing is an indirect washing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He washes us through the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With what does He apply the washing?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have mentioned previously that the Lord washed by pouring water into the basin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does water signify?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord died, blood and water flowed out of His side.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The blood signifies the redemptive aspect of His death, whereas the water signifies the non-redemptive aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The blood washes away our sins, whereas the water becomes the source of our new life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible water sometimes denotes death and sometimes denotes life in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This life is the new life that we received at the time of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This life comes out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The water in the basin signifies that the life is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we sin, we need to go to the Lord for our washing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when our feet are defiled, we need to go to the brothers for our washing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord said, "You also ought to wash one another's feet."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows that the foot-washing is carried out by the brothers and sisters, that is, by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one can say that he does not need his feet washed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"One another" includes all the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only you and I need the washing, Paul and John needed the washing also.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every believer, as long as he lives on this earth, will find his feet defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is different in the case of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many believers can completely overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But no one in this world can avoid having his feet defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>HOW TO WASH ONE ANOTHER'S FEET</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can we wash one another's feet?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose you have completed your day's work and feel tired.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You cannot utter any praises from your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the evening when you come to the meeting, someone asks you to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Halfway through your prayer, you cannot go on, and you stop.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You feel as if your prayer is nothing more than a composition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, perhaps one brother in the meeting has a fresh spirit, and his prayer refreshes your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Your spiritual energy is renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is washing one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times when we come to the meeting, we find the saints' spirit weak and downtrodden.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We pray and read the Word, but nothing seems to work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The reason for this is that everyone's feet are defiled, and there is no basin to wash the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is as if something is quenching our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If someone would stand up at this point and wash everyone's feet by offering a prayer or saying a few words, the whole meeting will be refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the basin and without the foot-washing, everyone's spirit is bound.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The same is true in our family life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A brother or sister may unexpectedly drop by your home and fellowship a short while or give a testimony, and everyone in the family is brought into the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before that time there was a separation between them and God, but after such a simple conversation, all the separation is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is washing one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who do this are precious in the Lord's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should have an ambition before the Lord to wash others' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In order to wash others' feet, we must have the water, that is, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit and be in constant fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For this cause we must live in the Holy Spirit daily.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only then will we have the living water to wash others' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Every time we come to the meeting, we must have the living water to wash others' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should never try to wash others' feet without water; that will only defile their feet even more.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Those who cannot wash others' feet may still fellowship and communicate with God, but their spirits are definitely cold.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today the Lord does not wash anyone's feet directly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Instead, He charges us to wash one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must all learn to be those who can wash one another's feet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"IF YOU KNOW THESE THINGS,</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>BLESSED ARE YOU IF YOU DO THEM"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In verse 15 the Lord said, "For I have given you an example so that you also may do even as I have done to you."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The words "even as" mean to do exactly the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whatever the Lord did, we should do in exactly the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do this we will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Foot-washing is not only a thing in the spirit, but also an actual, outward practice.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When the Lord washed the disciples' feet, He used a basin.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We also must have our basin.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If the Lord washed in a literal way, we should also wash in a literal way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord was not merely performing a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He was actually washing with water.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Since He washed literally, we should do the same; otherwise, we cannot express the spiritual reality behind it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we are baptized, not only do we remember the spiritual significance, we also go into the water literally.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The outward practice helps us to remember the inward, spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, on the one hand, we need to remember the inward, spiritual significance, and on the other hand, we need the outward practice.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Foot-washing is a practice carried out in the family, not in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For example, 1 Timothy 5:10 mentions the widow receiving hospitality and washing the saints' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This, of course, was conducted in the home.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We have to follow the Lord's example.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to wash the feet of the saints physically with water and a basin on the one hand, and wash their feet spiritually for their renewal on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>There is one further point.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should note the time the Lord washed the disciples' feet.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He washed their feet before the Feast of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We know that the Passover signifies our bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Why are we not fresh in our table meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is because we have not washed our feet before coming to the Passover feast.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If some can bring freshness to a bread-breaking meeting, they are remembering the Lord in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What is the result of such foot-washing?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>"If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The Lord blesses the foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is something that is acceptable to the Lord and well pleasing to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If we do this, we will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>May we all do what the Lord has done.</S>
