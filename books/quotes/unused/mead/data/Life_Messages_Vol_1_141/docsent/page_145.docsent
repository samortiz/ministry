   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"INTO THE INNER MAN"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This phrase, especially the word into, troubled me for years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did Paul use the word into rather than in?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt he chose the word into intentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Gradually through experience I began to understand the thought behind the words.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we are weak, we are outside the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are in our mind, or emotion, or will, or heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we are considering how inadequate the elders are or how insubordinate the sisters are, we may be assured that we are in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever we are thinking will lead to trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Flee from the mind!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Escape to the spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are weak when we are in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mind is the highway on which the brothers drive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most sisters, in contrast, are in their emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They consider why this or that sister does not pay any attention to them, or why the elders respect another sister more than them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are also a few brothers and sisters who stay in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their aspiration is to be better than all the others in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They resolve not to criticize the elders, even though they feel the elders are not doing a good job.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These descriptions give us a picture of the general condition of a local church: most brothers in their mind, most sisters in their emotion, and a few brothers and sisters in their will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a weak condition!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That is why Paul prayed that God the Father might grant us to be strengthened into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE WAY TO BE STRENGTHENED</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Exhorting or admonishing the saints does not help to bring them into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Telling the brothers and sisters not to gossip, for example, seems to lead to more gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The best way to be drawn into your inner man is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Forget your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not consider your condition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not be concerned about your gossiping tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Pray!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Lord, I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I want to breathe You in. Impart Yourself into the depths of my being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I long to see You.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Meet me as I pray-read Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Add more and more of Yourself to me."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you spend some time praying this way, you will find that you are transferred from your mind, or emotion, or will, or even your heart, and into your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The interest in gossiping will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You will be strengthened by the Spirit of God with power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Father longs to see us live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His good pleasure is that we be strengthened into the inner man according to the riches of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Morality and ethical virtue cannot compare with the expression of the divine life through us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not a matter of staying away from department stores or from places of worldly entertainment because we do not love the world any more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That attitude is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What we do is the outcome of our being strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>FILLED</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we are thus strengthened, Christ will make His home in our hearts and we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God Eph 3:17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By being filled with God's riches, we become the expression of those riches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are strengthened into our inner man, Christ makes His home in our heart, and we are filled even to the extent of the full expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not think such a living is beyond us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If this were not possible, it would not be mentioned in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the normal church life, fully expressing the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord's recovery is not for doctrines nor for outward practices.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is that we may experience this very strengthening into our inner man, that Christ may occupy our whole being until eventually we are filled with God unto His full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not be discouraged about the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not worry about the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Do not talk about this brother or that sister.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Pray, "Lord, thank You for my regenerated spirit where Christ dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do strengthen me according to the riches of Your glory, by Your powerful Spirit, into my inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Spread out from my spirit and settle also in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Make Your home in my whole inward being, that I may be filled with God, unto His full expression."</S>
