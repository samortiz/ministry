As the Lord's recovery is continually spreading throughout the world, these messages are more than crucial and urgently needed
Our hope and expectation is that these messages will become a governing and controlling vision for all in the Lord's recovery
We may be able to relate quite much to doctrine and visions, but now we must see the way to carry out what we have seen
Paul told Timothy to commit the things that he had heard from him to faithful men who would be competent to teach others
According to my experience and observation, we must first pick up the crucial points of the truth to carry out what we have seen
Even those of you who have a master's degree in English cannot explain a word exactly and adequately unless you go to the best lexicon
When a particular sentence uses a certain word, you must have the discernment to realize which denotation of this word to apply
They translated the word initiation into Chinese according to the first denotation in Webster's dictionary, that is, 'the beginning'
To initiate, to begin, something is one meaning; but to initiate a person into a particular club or organization is another meaning
When a person is initiated into a new group, that means the person is being brought in, introduced, or conducted in
In the book of Mark it is not the beginning of the Savior, but the Savior's being brought in, being introduced, being conducted in
The human language does not have the vocabulary because there is not something corresponding to it in the human culture
We must see that in any culture new words must be invented as the culture is progressing and new things are transpiring
There are a number of messages though which have been given on the matter of the designation of Christ and of our experience of designation
Public speakers are trained not to repeat too much, but in the ministry we are not concerned for the rules of public speaking
You must follow the Spirit's feeling as to whether what you have spoken has been really taken and received by the audience
Many times in our past we sat under a very trained, educated, and eloquent pastor but after his speaking we went home with nothing
In the same principle, in reading the pages of the Life-study messages, we must learn how to realize the crucial points
According to the flesh Jesus is out of the seed of David, but according to the Spirit of holiness Jesus was designated the Son of God
According to the flesh our Lord is out of the seed of David, but according to the Spirit of holiness He is designated the Son of God
Theology would merely tell us that this shows that Christ has two natures-one according to the flesh and the other according to the Spirit
We must learn that when we read a proper exposition or commentary of the holy Word, we should not read it as a newspaper
In the ancient Greek manuscripts of the Bible there is no space between words and sentences and even no punctuation
The scholars who put out the modern form of the manuscripts spent much time to decipher the word, sentence, and paragraph divisions
There is still some argument as to whether some words go at the end of a sentence or at the beginning of another sentence
Many of us who read the Bible and the Life-studies pick up some points but we do not relate any of these points to other points
In our studying of the Recovery Version there are three subsidiary items to the text itself the outlines the notes and the crossreferences
You must have a full understanding of its contents and every crucial point should have been impressed into your understanding
They would pick a word such as 'sanctified' and use the chain reference to trace this word's usage in the Bible
Even to learn a language you must learn the alphabet, the spelling of certain words, and then you must learn more words
You must learn how to compose a single sentence and progress further to composing a paragraph with five sentences
Even in the playing of basketball, the players must practice what the coach teaches them until this practice gets into their being
Without any intention and without any thought they can execute the plays and the moves out of their very being
Many of us have been in the Lord's recovery for at least fifteen years, but we did not get much of the proper help
If you would pick up this fellowship and go back to practice every day, you will see the difference after only half a year
The best way to become impressed with a book of the Bible and to keep this book in your memory is to keep the bird's-eye view of this book
After the healing of the entire person, there is the exposure of the real inner being, the heart, in chapter seven
The heart is seen in chapter seven as something that is dirty and contaminated with nothing good and nothing pure
The one who is sick of fever, leprosy, paralysis, and the flow of blood is rotten, dirty, and contaminated within his heart
Accompanying this sort of feeding are two miracles of feeding-the feeding of five thousand and the feeding of four thousand
We should praise the Lord that we are not wild dogs, street dogs, but we are pet dogs under the table of the children, who are the Jews
We cannot compare with the Jews, but, praise the Lord, we are still the pet dogs under the table eating the children's crumbs
Only such a person who passed through this marvelous process is qualified to go up to the mount of transfiguration
It was on the mount of transfiguration that the need of the healing of the listening organ, speaking organ, and seeing organ began
You need to see that Christ is unique and that He is the unique replacement to replace everything, including you
Do not hear culture; do not hear the prophets; do not hear the law; do not hear Moses or Elijah; do not hear anyone
From Mark 9 the Lord began to unveil who Christ is, what Christ will do and go through, and where Christ will be
In the first few chapters of the book of Mark, it seems that the Lord Jesus did not grasp Peter, James, and John
Even Peter's mistakes and shortcomings did not stop the Lord from grasping him until the Lord Jesus brought him to the cross with Him
Jesus brought Peter and the other disciples into His death, into the tomb, into His resurrection, and into His ascension
Jesus brought this person into His death and into His resurrection and this person ascended to the heavens in Jesus Christ
When a wife gets mad with her husband or when a husband gets mad with his wife their temperature goes up to one hundred and ten degrees
The case of the woman with the flow of blood is merged with the case of a girl who died at twelve years of age
Finally, the last section is a station ending with the local churches because the churches are mentioned in chapter sixteen
Also, since you are in Christ, you are in union, identified with, His death and resurrection, and you are in His death and resurrection
Because you are no longer a natural person in Adam but a resurrected person in Christ, you should no longer live in the old flesh
Now you have been transferred out of Adam into Christ and in Christ through His death and resurrection you are being transformed
Through this sanctification, we are fully conformed to the firstborn Son of God as His many brothers and as the many sons of God
You were once sinners in Adam, but now you are here in Christ, sons of God and brothers of Christ, to be conformed into His image
In chapter eleven we can again see the thought of God's mercy-all things are out of Him, through Him, and unto Him
Everything is up to Him and we as the Gentiles are the wild olive branches grafted into the genuine olive tree
If we do not receive a brother and keep him outside the door of the church because he is not 'our kind of Christian,' this is sectarian
It does not matter how weak this believer is, however, you must realize that as long as he is a real brother you must receive him
You may know all the crucial points in these books and you may even have a bird's-eye view of the entire Bible
They saw much more and went much further, but they did not call people's attention to Christ as life and to Christ as the Spirit
They did not see the crucial, subjective aspects of the church, which include the church as the fullness, the new man, and the lampstand
Their teaching became shallow and superficial because they thought most of the Chinese people were not educated or knowledgeable
Many of the missionaries at that time thought that the Chinese language was not adequate for the translation of the Bible
They lowered down their teaching purposely because they considered that the Chinese people could not understand the higher and deeper truths
He discovered that there were a lot of books written which were much deeper in their content than what we had heard
He began to buy many books and we were all influenced by him to buy many books concerning church history and the truths of the Bible
As a result, we uplifted the preaching with a higher kind of Bible interpretation and we presented the higher and deeper truths
Because western Christianity had become more than contented, this kind of situation forced the Lord to do a new thing
According to this theology, you should never say the Father is the Son and the Son is the Father and the Son is also the Spirit
They said that the everlasting Father in Isaiah 9:6 is not an accurate translation because in Hebrew everlasting is a noun
For the traditional teachers to indicate that besides the Father in the Godhead there is another Father is a top heresy
Jesus' is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew word Joshua , which means Jehovah the Savior or the salvation of Jehovah
If you do not say that the Father in Isaiah 9:6 is the Father in the Godhead, then what about the Father in 63:16 and 64:8
Isaiah prophesied in Isaiah 9:6 that a child would be born to us and a son given to us and that this son is called the everlasting Father
They say that the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17 does not refer to Jesus Christ, but that it is a general address referring to God
We have argued in the past that according to the context of this section which starts at 2:12, the Lord here must refer to Christ the Lord
With this understanding as a basis, verse 17 is a direct continuation of verse 6 which ends with the word 'the Spirit gives life'
It indicates that we need Jesus as our life supply so we receive Him into us as life supply just as we eat food
Ministry in the biblical usage means to serve people with something, just as a waiter in a restaurant serves people with the courses of food
At the conclusion of his writing ministry, Paul wrote 1 Timothy to inoculate the church against all these poisons
There is a proverb which says, 'One sentence can build up the nation and one sentence can destroy the entire nation'
As we have seen, Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 1:3 that he left him there in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently
We would all agree that to teach the way of Judaism is surely wrong, but what about teaching how to preach the gospel?
There is only one unique ministry that is justified, promoted, uplifted, and even glorified in the New Testament
In 1 Timothy 1:4 Paul went on to tell Timothy what those ones who were teaching differently should be occupied with-God's economy
Is there anything wrong with teaching people the Bible, with teaching people theology, or with teaching people how to preach the gospel?
The reason why their teachings were received is because they were scriptural things from the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament
We must realize that this is not a matter of being wrong or right, but it is a matter of 'cutting Christ's Body into pieces'
We may insist, stress, and emphasize a scriptural item which seemingly is right, yet actually it cuts the Body of Christ
On the other hand, there were some missionaries who went to China to teach different things according to their concept
As a result, they brought divisions there that have cut the Body of Christ in China into pieces and which could never be healed
They are altogether right and altogether scriptural, but we must be on the alert as to whether or not we are divisive
Paul could not control the situation in Corinth, but he charged the Lord's seekers and lovers to speak the same thing
It is possible for you to do something like the missionaries, who did a great work in China, but they cut the Body of Christ into pieces
If we are through with the oneness, we are through with the recovery, and we will become another repetition of today's Christianity
Be on the alert to watch for the subtle one, the Devil, who can put any kind of mask on his face to come to you
We must realize, though, that it is a serious matter to teach scriptural things and good things, yet somewhat different from God's economy
Peter never fell into division, but his being 'grey' in his ministry issued in the Corinthians taking him as a foundation of division
Some in Corinth were saying that they were of Cephas, that they were of Apollos, and even that they were of Paul
In the earlier chapters, we have seen what the New Testament ministry is and what the vision in the Lord's recovery is
As long as you can teach something different from the New Testament ministry, this indicates that you have never been constituted with it
He was the central figure of the New Testament ministry in Acts 2-5, but in Acts 10 he was on the border, even 'on the fringe of the roof'
The Lord came to him in the Old Testament way of a vision to move him from the 'fringe of the roof' of the New Testament to the center
Galatians 2 shows us that Peter had fallen away from the truth of the New Testament ministry, so Paul rebuked him
Even that little doubt is an indication that the institution of the New Testament economy into you may not be that thorough
Even if someone were to 'break us up' and 'grind us into powder,' it would show that we are not only golden but gold
We must ask, though, which students of the Bible and which teachers of the Bible have never used commentaries, expositions, or other books
Because we need the help of reference books, this does not mean that we replace the Bible with reference books
All of you should be encouraged not to be contented with what you already know, but you need to go further to develop more and more
Also, on the highway are white lines which indicate to us that we need to be restricted in our driving on the highway
The traffic on the earth must be regulated, and even the air traffic has its regulations; otherwise, many lives would be lost
Some have interpreted the land of Canaan, the good land, as a type of heaven and the Jordan River as a type of death
It seemed alright to say that after death we go to heaven, so the good land of Canaan must be a type of heaven
They said that Canaan typified the battlefield in the spiritual warfare where the overcoming saints fight the battle
By eating the Lamb, which was the beginning of their redeemed life, they were energized to cross the Red Sea to journey to God's destination
At the beginning of their journey they enjoyed Christ, not only as the redeeming Lamb, but also as the nourishing Lamb
They took their journey and on the way they enjoyed Christ again as the heavenly manna in the wilderness, as their daily portion
Eventually in the eighteenth century the Moravian brothers under the leadership of Zinzendorf began to practice the church life as brothers
At some of these secular universities, the students learn theology just like people learn art in the school of art
These dispensations are the dispensations of innocence, conscience, human government, promise, law, grace, and the kingdom
Some of the stricter Brethren teachers, though, say that according to Romans 5:14 there should be just four main dispensations
They did not see that God's dispensation, God's arrangement, or the arrangement of His divine administration, has a purpose
Based upon this, we have the light, the boldness, and the assurance to say that the dispensational teachings are right but missing the goal
To allegorize any kind of case in the Bible, both in the Old and New Testaments, you must allegorize with Christ and for the church
You are safe, and whatever you say is right because the entire Bible was written according to the basic principle-with Christ for the church
In our developing in the truth we must first keep the principle of the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people
God created man in His own image in Genesis, and in the New Testament Colossians 1:15 tells us that God's image is Christ
Another principle which we must take in our interpretation of the Bible is the principle of four items Christ the Spirit life and the church
The first principle we have seen is a general principle-the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people
Any message or any development of the Bible without Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church is an empty shell with no content
Many of these people turned to the way of the Lord's recovery to pick up Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church
Those who did not turn this way, including the evangelists, either disappeared or still remained with emptiness
The ones who turned this way not only remained but they became solid with the truth concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church
All the heresies came in by the way of developing the truth in the Bible apart from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church
If they had developed the truth of the presbytery with the church, they would have dared not set up a Presbyterian church
If God's holiness is going to be increased within you, you must live according to God's nature and by God's life
We must also realize that this holy life should not only be for our personal living but it must also be a part of the church life
If we would develop the doctrine of holiness with Christ with the Spirit with life and with the church we would see a marvelous revelation
Your doctrine, on the other hand, may not be wrong, but eventually the issue of your practice will be a division
Even if something is good and scriptural, never develop it apart from Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church
Far, the two main aspects we have seen concerning the divine Trinity are the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity
In the essential Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere at the same time and in the same way with no succession
The Father planned, the Son accomplished, and the Spirit applies what the Son accomplished according to the Father's plan
The essential Trinity refers to the essence of the Triune God for His existence; the economical Trinity refers to His plan for His move
There is the need of the existence of the divine Trinity, and there is also the need of the plan of the divine Trinity
In essence, the three of the Godhead exist equally at the same time and coinhere equally at the same time from eternity to eternity
We must be careful, though, to realize that the Father did the selection and the predestination, but He did not do them alone
If we say that the Father chose us and selected us alone, we jeopardize the coinherence and the coexistence of the divine Trinity
He came to live a human life for thirty-three and a half years, to die an all-inclusive death, and to resurrect from the dead
If the Son had come by Himself alone this again would have jeopardized the coexistence and the coinherence the essence of the divine Trinity
We need the Spirit to lead us and to guide us not only day by day but also minute by minute in all the details of our daily life
We can only say that the Son did all the works to accomplish the Father's plan with the Father and by the Spirit
We cannot say, though, that all the works in the third step are done by the Father with the Son and through the Spirit
In a general way God is dispensing Himself into us, but in a particular, actual, and practical way God is dispensing His Trinity into us
Ephesians 4:6 shows us that the Father is in us: 'One God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all'
His Trinity is constituted solely with His Person, and His Person is in the Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
If someone preaching the gospel says, 'If you do not repent, you will go to hell,' is this a kind of threatening?
In 1922 the recovery was in an experimental stage, but today it is no longer that much an experimental operation
In the history of theological study concerning the divine Trinity, three words have been used-essence, hypostasis, and substance
We need to clarify the meaning of these three words, which we have already mentioned in relation to the divine Trinity
We can see what the word essence means in the study of the divine Trinity by defining two related words-element and nature
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the three hypostases or substances of the divine Trinity or of the Godhead
In the study of the divine Trinity the following crucial statement was made-the Triune God has three substances but only one essence
The first step was taken by the Father, the second step was taken by the Son, and the third step was taken by the Spirit
God selected persons according to His foreknowledge, and third, He predestinated or marked out His chosen people
In the Bible we are told that all things came into being through Him and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being
We do not consider God's living on this earth in the Man Jesus for thirty-three and a half years as a great work
His conception His birth His death resurrection and ascension are at the two ends of this revelation while the main part is His human living
Many of today's Christians merely pick up 'gleanings' from the field of the divine revelation, and they become proud
Even what we have picked up from the divine revelation of the holy Word might also be considered in the Lord's eyes as 'gleanings'
The Son was sent by the Father and He was even given to us by the Father, but when He came, He came with the Father
The Son came in a way of divine conception which was carried out by the Spirit, of the Spirit, and with the Spirit
The divine conception of Jesus was carried out by the Holy Spirit, of the Holy Spirit, and with the Holy Spirit
His conception was a mingling of the divine essence with the human essence, and this mingling produced a God-man
According to the entire revelation of the sixty-six books of the Bible, the Trinity of the Godhead is for God's dispensing
Baptism brings people into the Triune God, into a spiritual union with the Triune God as indicated by the word 'into'
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
In 2 Corinthians 13:14 grace, love, and fellowship are attributes of the Triune God, but the top attribute of our God is the Trinity
If God were not triune, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, He could not have a way to dispense Himself into us
As the Son, the Triune God did many works in creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Now He is doing a finer work as the Spirit in regeneration, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification
There is nothing wrong with saying that God exercised His foreknowledge, chose us, predestinated us, and created the world
In the Bible we cannot see the church of the Father or the church of the Spirit, but the church of Christ and the church of God
Throughout church history, Christendom has picked up many things which are not in accordance with the truth of the divine revelation
Up until Luther's time, the Catholic Church had picked up much 'dirt' of pagan practices and unscriptural doctrines
Based upon our experience over the years, we must admit that in the matter of educating the saints we have not been very successful
We all have to admit that from the point of view of educating the saints with the basic truth our way of meeting has not been so successful
Not only in the matter of life but even more in the matter of the truth not much intrinsic element has been wrought into the saints
He indicated that Britain and Germany were solid countries, but that the United States was loose and too worldly
Other expositions and commentaries, for example, do not correctly point out what the main truth in the book of Matthew is
The first purpose of the notes is to present to you the truth, and the second purpose is to minister to you the life supply
Many of you can testify that you do not get as much nourishment from other expositions and commentaries as you can from the Recovery Version
The notes in the Recovery Version are also an attempt to solve the hard problems in the Bible to help the readers get through them
Because we have a Recovery Version of the entire New Testament, we must testify that the books of the New Testament have been opened to us
To most believers Revelation is a closed book, but when you get the Recovery Version of Revelation you cannot say that it is a closed book
The basic truths have been presented to us, and much life nourishment has been put into print, especially with the Life-study messages
The intention and the goal of our publishing of the Life-study messages is to open up the mine for you to go in and dig
There was nothing of the Triune God dispensing Himself nothing of Christ and the church and nothing of Christ the Spirit life and the church
Some of you have been in the recovery for years and yet you have never gotten into the intrinsic element of the Lord's recovery
When the Lord was on this earth He also preached the gospel, taught the truth, ministered life, and prepared the disciples
Our meeting should be carried out in a living way such that all the saints might be nourished on the one hand and educated on the other hand
Many saints have been meeting with us for over five years and yet they do not know much concerning the basic truths
After three years of meeting with us, the saints should have received some solid education of the New Testament ministry
To see something short or weak in the past does not mean that we blame that, but it means that we have to improve
Maybe one local church has a sense to take a certain way and another local church takes a little different way
In principle, we need thorough fellowship, and then the Lord may lead us to pick up a better way to take care of our meetings
History has clearly shown us that the existence of a denomination, free group, or the genuine church life all depends on the doctrines
The Assembly of God, the solid and big denomination built up by the Pentecostal movement, was established in 1914
They charged their students to realize that the way to build up the church is to put out doctrines or teachings
We are not for the ology of God, the ology of Christ, the ology of the church, or the ology of the divine things
For the long run, we surely have to help the saints in the Lord's recovery to get into the top spiritual education
You must remember that we still uplift the living Christ, the life-giving Spirit, life itself and its riches, and the church in a living way
Many Christian publications are produced in the United States; in other countries, however, there has nearly been nothing produced
The saints there really saw something, and groups of great Bible teachers were produced in Britain up to the first third of this century
After the first third of this century, however, Britain has produced nearly nothing in the way of top spiritual publications
We must have a personal way laid as a foundation for us to stand on and then go on to take care of the meeting way
During this time, all those who left the church and who caused trouble and became a failure never received a solid foundation in the Word
When the patient comes back to him after two months, the doctor can tell whether or not the patient took the drugs
The patient's breathing, color, and entire being tells the doctor that the patient did not take the prescription
If you would begin to study the Life-studies every day starting tomorrow morning, you will become a different person even after fifty days
We should help the saints to build up a practice or a habit that every day they would spend a least thirty minutes in the Word
After one year of studying the Bible in this way, there will be a solid change in the saints' home life, private life, and church life
We may think this is too slow, but even if it took us ten years to finish the entire New Testament that would be wonderful
Many of you leading ones have never encouraged the saints in the last five years to get into the truths in the way of using the Life-studies
We must realize that to shepherd a church is to take care of a big family with many folks who are young, old, and middle-aged
If the saints do love the Lord's recovery, they must get themselves fed all the time with the healthy food that they may be strong
As a result of eating a proper, regular diet, the saints will be strong and the Lord will have a strong testimony
They should be full of life and full of living prayer to bring in a living atmosphere which is full of freedom for everyone to function
The elders and all the ones who take the lead in any kind of meeting should bear the responsibility to pray for this
Every elder should come to the meeting after some prayer for the meeting and come into the meeting with a praying spirit
In the church meetings it would be good to continue on a certain book and to go through it chapter after chapter
Undoubtedly we have to prayread the basic verses in the meeting but the leaders and the elders should not let the prayreading go too long
If thirty minutes have gone by and it seems that there has been nothing solid to nourish people, you should 'put out a dish'
To put out a dish means to minister a certain crucial point which is rich, refreshing, enlightening, edifying, and building
Even now we may encourage the saints to preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life, but they are empty
You want to minister life to others in your neighborhood to your cousins to your relatives and inlaws but you do not have the riches of life
It is basic to have the saints getting into the Word personally every day and to have the entire meeting entering into the truth
Corinthians 14:26 tells us that whenever we come together, each has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation
They should pick up the crucial points, especially the points concerning the life supply or concerning the unveiling of the truth
The elders and the seeking ones who really bear the responsibility of the Lord's recovery in their locality must make up the lack
They need to strike the match to start the burning, and then keep their hands off the meeting and let others do it
If after ten or fifteen minutes nothing good has come out then the ones who bear the responsibility especially the elders must do it again
Did not the Lord use the five loaves and two small fish to feed five thousand, and still there were twelve baskets left over?
To work properly, to gain more so that you can take care of the needy ones, is the proper going on for the long run in the New Testament
It would not be like some of our experience in the past, because in the past nobody actually bore the responsibility
When the whole church comes together, this one may have a psalm, that one may have a teaching, and another may have a revelation
To prepare yourself for the meeting is to get into the Word and to get into some messages which can help you to enter into the truth
Once the truth has been constituted into someone, however, it will remain there forever and its remaining is its supply
Our need for the long run is this kind of education with the truth, which is really something solid, living, and existing
If we serve the living God and this God is the Spirit, we should be in the Spirit all the time if we mean business with Him
When you come in the meeting in this way you are not in the Spirit but in death, and your coming in brings in death
When you speak something, that kills the meeting or at the very least lowers down the meeting because you are not a person in Spirit
Every one of these serving ones must be charged, including the elders, to bear the ark of the testimony on their shoulders
Before every meeting, these dear saints should be living in the Spirit and should get themselves fully ready to bear the ark
The church belongs to the saints and the meetings are the saints' meetings, so you must be one with the saints
Some of the saints are still young, yet a good number have grown up and they are serving and bearing some responsibility
As long as you have the knowledge of these three matters, it will be easy for you to cover a complete message in one meeting
Sometimes in reading messages in a church meeting you may skip over part of a paragraph, or even an entire paragraph, in order to save time
The reading of a Life-study message in a meeting should be considered the same as the speaking of such a message
If you, then, speak something that is off from the ministry, surely the recovery will not follow that speaking
It is a dream to think that the entire recovery will follow the speaking that is different from that of the ministry
We have taught very strongly that each local church is not a Body of Christ; all the churches together are the one Body
If you speak something contrary to the taste of the Lords recovery your speaking will be rejected and you will be the first to suffer loss
Those who teach differently are not wise, for they do not know the environment, situation, and condition of the Lord's recovery
If you try to change the taste of the saints, you will be foolish, you will waste your time, and you will cause damage
If you feel that your teaching is better than that in the Lord's recovery, you should serve your 'food' to those who have a taste for it
For the long run in their daily living they will eat what matches their taste and reject what is contrary to it
If you can give messages that fit the taste of the Lord's recovery without using the Life-study messages, that would be wonderful
Anyone who does not have this knowledge of the truth cannot take care of the church, God's flock, in a proper way
My purpose in saying this is not to disappoint anyone; my purpose is to present the situation in an honest way
When some hear that certain brothers have become elders in a natural way they may say Brother Lee why dont you do something about this
The more you are constituted of the truths of the New Testament, the more you have been divinely appointed to be an elder
Today the divine appointment is nothing other than the adequate knowledge of the basic truths of the New Testament
Some in the Pentecostal movement claim to have a divine appointment, but the result of their so-called appointment is confusion
They may not have the title or the position of an elder, but as long as they are present in a locality, the church receives the benefit
Rather, being an elder depends on the degree to which one has the proper knowledge of the New Testament economy
It is difficult to gain from the writings of expositors the adequate knowledge of the basic truths of the New Testament
If you do not have this divine deposit in your being, you are not qualified for the eldership, because you lack the necessary 'capital'
Those who are not constituted of the truth may be able to bring people into the church life, but they are not able to take them on
We all treasured those twenty-four volumes and to some extent the messages conveyed in those twenty-four volumes got into our being
During those two or three years he would have a few days for a conference about every two months but most of those messages were not printed
The messages which Brother Nee gave were good messages and were very touching, rich, uplifting, living, and refreshing
When there was a need to present the truths in Brother Nee's messages to others, very few were capable of doing this
Even among the co-workers at that time, only a few out of five hundred co-workers could present a truth in a doctrinal way
Yu's translations of the mystical books such as the autobiography of Madame Guyon, and a small portion of my books
In 1 Timothy 2:4 Paul tells Timothy that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth
The conferences mainly were to pick up a certain burden or an item and give anywhere from seven to ten messages
The messages in the conferences mainly impressed people with the point of life and rendered them some inspiration
They do not, however, serve the purpose of educating the saints or building up the saints in the full knowledge of the truth
When you make a decision to cover all the books of the New Testament, though, you cannot avoid covering the truth in its entirety
It is divided into three parts the fellowship of the divine life the teaching of the divine anointing and the virtues of the divine birth
All the saints in the Lord's recovery need to be those who preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life to others
They have the desire to teach the truth, but they do not have the materials constituted into their being to talk about
Eventually he is not able to preach even a little of the gospel because he was not trained or raised up in that way
Proper parents must take care of bringing their children up through elementary, junior high, high school, and college
We should not only help them grow in life, but also help them to be educated and built up in the proper knowledge of the truth
To carry out this educational work we must come to the Life-study messages with the Recovery Version and the notes
There is also a need among us for many young people to dedicate two years to the Lord after graduation from college
They should study book after book and chapter after chapter with no choice for a particular book of their preference
All of us elder brothers need to get ourselves saturated, soaked, and constituted with this basic knowledge of God's Word
All of us who have some experience with the Life-study messages know that they may be considered as the best help
We should encourage the saints to have a private time in the Lord's Word and that they should do this as a proper rule of their daily life
Regardless of how busy or how tired we are, we can reserve thirty minutes a day for a time with the Lord in the Word
The truth concerning the salvation of the soul is contained in a textbook we have published entitled God's Full Salvation
We have covered the salvation of the soul quite often and have published many pages on this matter with many points
It seems that we all heard this and probably we all knew this, but when we try to present it we cannot make it
One evening a week should be used for the prayer meeting and another evening to gather together around the Lord's Word again
In addition to these main meetings, there are also small meetings such as the young people's meeting and children's meeting
It is possible for us to reserve thirty minutes in both the prayer meeting and the Lord's table meeting to train the saints in the truth
We need approximately one hour and fifteen minutes for the Lord's table and then about thirty minutes for the saints to share
The last half hour of the Lord's table should be devoted to another training, which could be called a church family training
If the elders would give these types of lessons twice a week, this would impress the saints and build them up in the knowledge of the truth
When they need to talk to people about the gospel, they will have the utterance, the expression, and the material
It will not be rich in stories jokes or even in socalled biblical doctrines but rich in Christ in the Spirit in life and in the church
We will be the kind of people who live in the way of preaching, teaching, and ministering to others wherever we are
Years ago we probably went to our 'refrigerator' and there was nothing there, and we went to our 'shelves' and they were empty
We need to measure and weigh what our present need is to decide what particular groceries can meet the need in our locality
A diligent seeker of the Lord could possibly finish the entire New Testament by studying two hours a day for two and a half years
If the church, however, took seven and a half years to get through the entire New Testament this would still be wonderful
