   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DYING FOR THE CREATION TO TASTE DEATH ON BEHALF OF ALL CREATION IN HIS HUMANITY WITH HIS DIVINITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not only so, but once He passed through human living, He went one great step further to die for the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Apparently, the Lord was crucified because He was betrayed by Judas, arrested by the servants of the high priest, and condemned to death by Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Actually, it was He Himself who helped to materialize His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you study the Bible carefully, you can see that when the Lord Jesus was in Galilee, He went hurriedly to Jerusalem because the Passover was approaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why did He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was because that year was the time for the completion of the sixty-ninth week of the seventy weeks mentioned in Daniel 9:24-26.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was very clearly mentioned there that during the sixty-ninth week, the Messiah, who was Christ, would be cut off, that is, killed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He knew that at the Passover of that year, He would be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He also knew that He had to die in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Abraham had offered Isaac and which was later called Mount Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, according to the type of the Passover, He had to die on the fourteenth day of the first month.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, He went quickly from Galilee to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Six days before the Passover, He entered Jerusalem, giving the Jews four days to examine Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was also for the fulfillment of the type in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Exodus 12:3-6, the Passover lamb, which was to be without blemish, had to be prepared in the four days preceding the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, in those four days, He placed Himself in the temple under the meticulous examination of the Sadducees, Pharisees, chief priests, scribes, and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After examining Him for four days, they found no fault in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then they arrested Him and delivered Him up to be examined by a Gentile official.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet, Pilate said three times, "I find no fault in this man."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was truly the sinless Lamb, the Lamb without any defects or blemishes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, He was worthy to die on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By this we can see that in actuality He was not arrested by men; rather, He delivered Himself up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He walked into death Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, He did not go merely to die; instead, He passed through death to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A certain portion of His work had to be done in death.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If He did not enter into death, He could not have done that work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He went into death to accomplish a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As we have pointed out in the past, the Lord Jesus died on the cross in seven statuses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First, He was the Lamb of God; second, He was a man in the flesh; third, He was the One signified by the bronze serpent; fourth, He was the last Adam; fifth, He was the Firstborn of all creation; sixth, He was the Peacemaker and the peace; and seventh, He was also a grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When He died on the cross, He died in these seven statuses.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, His death included at least seven aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First, He was the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, He was a man in the flesh who was considered sin by God; He did not know sin but was made sin by God, and in His flesh God condemned our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Third, He was the bronze serpent with the serpent's form but without the serpent's poison.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As such, when He was judged on the cross, He destroyed Satan, the ancient serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Fourth, He was the last Adam, the last old man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, when He died, He crucified the old man and ended the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, Romans 6:6 says that our old man has been crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Fifth, He was the Firstborn of all creation, and He died as a creature, representing all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This may be compared to the veil in the temple in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The veil signified His flesh, and on the veil were embroidered cherubim, the four living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the veil was rent, the four living creatures were also rent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This meant that when Christ died, all the creation died and was terminated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sixth, when He died on the cross, He abolished all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Judaic ordinances made it impossible for the Jews to be one with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every people has its own ordinances, and every place has its own customs and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All these resulted in dividing the peoples on the earth into nations.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He abolished all these ordinances on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lastly, He died on the cross as a grain of wheat sown into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the positive side, He released the divine life that was within Him to produce many grains, which are the tens of millions who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these grains are made into one bread, which is one Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How all-inclusive and unlimited His death is!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Why is it unlimited?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is because He was crucified in His humanity with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can illustrate this by a grain of wheat sown into the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, the grain dies because its shell decays.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the same time, however, the life within the grain begins to operate and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, 1 Peter 3:18 says that when Christ was on the cross, He was put to death in the flesh but made alive in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is just like the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to its outer shell, it is decaying, but according to its inner life, it operates to bring forth tender sprouts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a picture of resurrection.</S>
