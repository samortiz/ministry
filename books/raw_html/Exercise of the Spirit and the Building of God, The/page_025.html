        <h2 class="head1">PRAYING INDIVIDUALLY</h2>
<p>We must spend more time to exercise our spirit in individual prayer. We must learn and practice this even when we are very busy. The brothers should exercise their spirit both when they are on their way to work and while they are at work. The sisters should exercise their spirit while they are doing their chores at home and while they are buying groceries. This is our urgent need. If we cannot learn to exercise our spirit, the Lord will not gain a way to build His church among us.</p>
<p>The Lord has achieved much among us. In Taipei alone, there are over two hundred elders, co-workers, and responsible ones. We must admit that we have a considerable amount of building material. However, this material has not been sufficiently blended in spirit. We are not able to meet the Lord&rsquo;s requirement or afford Him a way to spread, because our spirit is still not strong or living. We need to focus on exercising our spirit when we pray individually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING FORMALITIES AND REGULATIONS</h2>
<p>We must also consider the condition of our meetings. Christian meetings in both Catholicism and Protestantism have fallen into rituals and regulations. According to Acts, the early saints did not have forms, rituals, or regulations when they met together. They met and served in spirit. They did not meet on a fixed date or at a fixed time. It seems as if they were always meeting. When the apostles Peter and John were released from prison in chapter 4, they went immediately to their own people (v. 23) and had a meeting. On another occasion, after the apostle Peter was released from prison, &ldquo;he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark, where there was a considerable number assembled together and praying&rdquo; (12:12). We should not think that this was the only group of saints who assembled together and prayed. We should believe that many other groups of saints were assembled together in other places. Their meetings were not bound by time, date, or place, nor did they have rituals or regulations.</p>
<p>The situation in Christianity, however, has degraded. Catholicism and Protestantism have fallen into rituals and rules. We have to admit that we too have been affected by Christianity. Unconsciously, our meetings have fallen into rituals and regulations.</p>
<p>We must consider the condition of our meetings. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day there is a message in the morning, and we break bread in the evening; the prayer meeting is Tuesday evening, and there is another message meeting on Thursday evening. We know that these meetings are on fixed days and are conducted in a particular way. The new believers might feel that the meetings are fresh and rich in supply, but the saints who have been meeting for five to ten years feel that the meetings are wearisome and even burdensome. If a meeting is scheduled to begin at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, these saints will arrive at half past seven. On the way to the meeting they talk freely with their companions, but once they step into the meeting hall, their spirit is closed, and their whole being is locked. It seems as though they have made up their mind not to open their mouth in the meeting. Everyone knows the procedure for the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. First, the brother who accompanies the speaker to the podium selects a hymn for the saints to sing. After the congregation sings, he offers a prayer. After the prayer, the speaker reads the Scriptures and then gives a message. After the message, there are announcements, and then the meeting is dismissed. At this point everyone can relax.</p>
<p>Can we expect the saints who attend such meetings to take the initiative to exercise their spirit? We admit that some saints are able to meditate and fellowship with the Lord in spirit, but only a few saints practice this. However, even if all the saints practiced this, their spirit would still not be sufficiently released. We simply cannot believe that this was the situation of the early church.</p>
<p>A situation that does not involve the release of the spirit is abnormal and improper. In a normal situation, every child of God should use his spirit, exercise his spirit, and fellowship with the Lord in spirit. Furthermore, when there is the opportunity, he should gather other saints together, not to gossip but to pray in spirit, read the Scriptures, fellowship, and exhort one another or to preach the gospel to their relatives and friends. If it is inconvenient to meet in their homes, they can go to a nearby meeting hall. They should not be bound by time, location, or formalities. The ministry of the word should also be done in a flexible way. When there is a burden, the brothers can give a message, just as the saints did in Acts 20. On the first day of the week, while the saints were gathered together to break bread, the apostle Paul rose up and gave an extended message (v. 7). This shows that their meeting did not have a set time to begin or to end.</p>
<p>In order for the Spirit to have a free course among us, we must learn to exercise our spirit in private prayer, and our meetings must break away from formalities and regulations, not being bound by time, place, or form. The church in Taipei has thirty-five districts. When it is convenient, the saints should gather in the nearest district for prayer and fellowship. The saints should be able to meet at any time, from morning to evening, in the meeting hall seven days a week in order to pray, read the Word, sing hymns, fellowship, and preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we need to be flexible. It is not necessary for everyone who comes to the meeting hall to do the same thing. Perhaps three or five saints would pray and sing in one corner, while seven or eight saints would read the Bible and fellowship in another corner. Perhaps in still another corner some saints would fellowship concerning preaching the gospel to their schoolmates, relatives, or friends. This means that the saints are exercising their spirit to serve God in whatever they do.</p>
<p>Our meetings must have a radical change. In the past, the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning message meeting began at ten o&rsquo;clock. A brother would release a message, then everyone would pray silently, and the meeting would be dismissed. This meeting does not have to begin at ten o&rsquo;clock. Early in the morning some saints can come to the meeting hall to pray in groups, and other saints might come to clean the hall. Some saints might remain in the hall until it is time for the message, but others might leave to take care of personal matters and then return later for the message. Then at around ten o&rsquo;clock all the groups of saints can stop what they are doing and listen to the message. After the message there is no need to dismiss the meeting, because some saints might remain in the meeting hall to pray and have thorough fellowship.</p>
<p>Likewise, the bread-breaking meeting does not have to begin at seven-thirty in the evening, because we spend only about forty-five minutes to remember the Lord and worship the Father. Some of the brothers who are in the military service might come to the meeting hall by five-thirty and pray, read the Word, and praise. A group of sisters might come after six o&rsquo;clock. Most of the saints should arrive by seven o&rsquo;clock and form groups to pray, sing hymns, read the Word, or fellowship with one another. As a result, everyone will be released and living, and they will be able to focus on remembering the Lord and worshipping the Father. The praise in such a meeting will be fresh and uplifted.</p>
<p>The prayer meeting on Tuesday should not be bound by time or form. If necessary, the leading brothers should fellowship concerning some of the items for prayer so that the saints can pray concerning these items in their group meetings. The meeting on Thursday should be conducted in the same way as the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. A brother should spend about forty minutes to release the Lord&rsquo;s word, but the saints do not need to arrive or leave at a specific time.</p>
<p>The saints should not be bound by time or formalities; they need only to serve the Lord in spirit. The way we serve may vary every week; it all depends on the move of the Spirit. Some saints may feel to &ldquo;burn the incense&rdquo; through prayer, others may feel to &ldquo;light the lamps&rdquo; by reading the Scriptures, and still others may feel to sing and praise. Some saints might bring unbelieving relatives, friends, or schoolmates, and other saints might preach the gospel to them. This is the way for us to break away from formalities and regulations in our meetings. The building of the church is without formalities; it depends on our using and exercising our spirit in our daily living so that we can serve and coordinate with others with a living spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>May the Lord grant us to not merely have a change in method. If the saints are enlivened, they will not be limited by time or methods when they pray, sing hymns, read the Bible, or minister the word.</p>
<p>May we all bring this matter to the Lord in prayer. May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us from the rituals and regulations of worship in Christianity. Then His church can be built up in spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
