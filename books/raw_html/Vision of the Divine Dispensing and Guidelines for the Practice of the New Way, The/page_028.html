In this chapter we will see the matter of being cultivated in the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE</H2><P>The first thing we have to see is that Christ is the life of the believers (Col. 3:4a). The life that we have originally is the human life. When we believe in the Lord, we receive another life, the divine life. In God's salvation, He has worked Himself into us and has become our life. Therefore, there are two lives within us, the human life and the divine life.</P><P>We were created in God's image and after His likeness (Gen. 1:26). Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." Hence, man is a living creature. He is like God in that he has a mind, a will, and an emotion, with feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure. When we believed in the Lord, another life came in, and we became even more complicated. This is like a person after he gets married. Prior to his marriage, he lived a bachelor's life. But after marriage he has to learn to live one life but with two persons. This becomes more troublesome and difficult. Herein lies a practical problem: since we now have two lives, according to which life do we live?</P><P>God's salvation for us is a person. This person is Christ Himself. God's salvation is Christ as a living person coming into us to be our life. For this reason, we need to cooperate and coordinate with Him. This requires much discipline and learning. For this reason, God not only gave us the Holy Spirit within as our life, but He also gave us the Bible outside of us to teach us the way to cooperate with Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST LIVING IN US</H2><P>Christ is not only our life, but He also lives in us. Galatians 2:20a says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me." This does not mean that since we have received Christ into us, we have exchanged our life with Christ's life and that the superior life of Christ has replaced our inferior life. Although the first half of this verse says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live," the second half of this verse says, "And the life which I now live in the flesh." Hence, it is still I who am living. What is crucified and terminated is the old "I," and what is regenerated with God within as life is the new "I." On the one hand, I have been terminated, and on the other hand, I still live. This is like Romans 6:6, which says that our old man has been crucified with Christ. Verse 11 then says that in Christ we are dead to sin but alive to God. From this we can see that we do not have an exchanged life but a joined life.</P><P>This joined life can be illustrated by the grafting as seen in Romans 11. Here it says that we the Gentiles, who were the wild olive branches, have been grafted into a cultivated olive tree (vv. 17, 20). We have become the branches of Christ, the true vine (John 15:1). Grafting is an organic joining together. It is not to exchange an inferior life for a superior life. Rather, it is the joining of two lives as one, so that there is a mingled life and a mingled living. The joining of the branches to the tree is not an outward union, but an inward mingling. Through the supply of the sap of the tree, a new life element is brought in. As a result, sweet fruit is produced. The life that a Christian has received is such an outwardly-joined and inwardly-mingled life. Christ and we share the same life and the same living.</P>
