<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The title of this chapter is &ldquo;Endeavoring to Have Church Meetings Rich in Mutuality.&rdquo; The words <em>church</em> and <em>mutuality</em> are complicated. The Greek word translated &ldquo;church,&rdquo; <em>ekklesia,</em> denotes &ldquo;a called-out congregation.&rdquo; The word <em>church</em> has been damaged by its usage in traditional Christianity and has lost its original meaning. When the Brethren were raised up in Great Britain over a hundred years ago, they felt that the word <em>church</em> was inappropriate. Hence, based on the notion of a congregation, they used the word <em>assembly</em> instead of <em>church.</em> Some believers in the Pentecostal movement in America do not use the word <em>church</em> and thus call themselves the Assemblies of God. Some of their missionaries who went to China around 1930 used the word <em>assembly.</em></p>
<p>When we were raised up by the Lord in China, we knew that the Chinese term for <em>church,</em> which is <em>jiao-hui,</em> was coined by the Western missionaries for the translation of the Bible. This term was not in the Chinese vocabulary. <em>Hui</em> means &ldquo;gathering&rdquo; and <em>jiao</em> means &ldquo;religion&rdquo;; hence, this term means &ldquo;religious gathering.&rdquo; Christian meetings should not be religious gatherings but a gathering of the called-out ones. According to the meaning of the Greek word, in our Chinese publications we use the term <em>zhao-hui,</em> which means &ldquo;a called-out assembly.&rdquo; We made this change because the Lord&rsquo;s Body is not a religious gathering; it is the assembling together of those who have been called out by God. We have been called out of the world to become God&rsquo;s called-out congregation, the church as the Body of Christ for the expression of God. This is the significance of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MUTUALITY IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2>
<p>The word <em>mutuality</em> is used in relation to church meetings and is the basic principle of the meetings of the church. This is shown in three portions of the Word. Colossians 3 says that we need to practice &ldquo;teaching and admonishing one another&rdquo; (v. 16). Teaching one another means that you teach me and that I teach you; admonishing one another means that you admonish me and that I admonish you. This indicates that as believers, we should be full of mutuality when we come together. Hebrews 10:25 says that we should not abandon &ldquo;our own assembling together...but exhorting one another.&rdquo; Since we are the Lord&rsquo;s disciples, we should not abandon proper Christian meetings. Moreover, whenever we meet, there should be mutuality. First Corinthians 14:26 says that whenever we &ldquo;come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation.&rdquo; This verse refers to the gathering of the whole church (v. 23). In such a gathering there should not be only one person speaking; rather, each one should function for building up (v. 26), that is, for mutual building up.</p>
<h2 class="head2">One Person Speaking Being a Meeting<br />
Related to the Work, Not a Church Meeting</h2>
<p>A meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening does not refer to a meeting of the church. Rather, it refers to a meeting related to the work. The purpose of such a gathering is to listen to God&rsquo;s speaking. Meetings related to the work may have one or two speakers, because their main purpose is to teach. In the Bible such meetings were not held regularly. On the day of Pentecost Peter stood and spoke to all the people. That was not a church gathering. The meetings of the church have a different setting.</p>
<p>In Acts 20:5-11 the apostle Paul spent seven days with the church in Troas. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day the church gathered together to break bread. Because Paul was planning to leave the next day, and being concerned that he might not return, he grasped the opportunity in that meeting and spoke until daybreak. During such an all-night meeting, Paul spoke for the first half of the night, then they broke bread, and he spoke again until daybreak. Such a meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening was not a regular meeting of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking to One Another with Hymns</h2>
<p>In this conference one person is speaking, and the rest are listening. However, this is not a meeting of the church. It is a Chinese-speaking conference. As such, these meetings are not regular church meetings but special gatherings. Regular church meetings should not have only one person speaking and the rest listening. Instead, church meetings should be mutual in nature, that is, everyone speaking and everyone exhorting. In other words, there should be mutual teaching and mutual exhorting. There may also be the speaking of hymns to one another (Col. 3:16; Eph. 5:19). Regrettably, such a practice has been abandoned by Christianity.</p>
<p>I was born in a Christian family, and from my youth I attended the so-called services with my mother. In those services I never saw believers speaking to one another. Even in our meetings it is rare to see such a practice. At the most we have one person calling a hymn and all the saints singing together. The Bible says that we should not only sing hymns but also speak them. This does not mean that I alone speak to all of you but that we all speak to one another&mdash;you speak a line, and I speak another line. This kind of mutuality should not have rules or regulations. As soon as there are rules and regulations, the practice of mutuality will become mechanical and lose its sweetness. Genuine mutuality is without regulations and causes the saints to be released and to touch the Lord.</p>
<p>Meetings related to the work, with one person speaking and the rest listening, are not suitable for mutual speaking because there are too many people present. The best setting for the practice of mutuality is the small meetings of the church, such as a home meeting with three to five people, a group meeting with eight to ten people, and a district meeting with not more than fifty people. In a meeting with around eight hundred people, speaking to one another would become shouting at one another in a disorderly manner. In such a large meeting it would be best to divide into groups for the practice of speaking to one another. We need to be trained in this matter.</p>
<p>We have never practiced speaking hymns to one another. However, in a conference in Indonesia twenty years ago, I asked the saints to speak a hymn to one another. Since then I have not seen another meeting like that one. The Holy Spirit did a powerful work that day, for the mutual speaking was full of enjoyment and supply, even though several hundred saints were present.</p>
<p>I would encourage the married couples to practice speaking to one another. A husband can say to his wife, &ldquo;You should love the Lord,&rdquo; and the wife can respond, &ldquo;You should also love the Lord.&rdquo; The husband may say, &ldquo;We should pray,&rdquo; and the wife can respond, &ldquo;Yes, we should also praise!&rdquo; Such mutual speaking is wonderful because it will eliminate quarrels and arguments. Sometimes if a husband notices that his wife is about to quarrel, he can say, &ldquo;You should pray.&rdquo; If his wife becomes angry and says, &ldquo;You should pray too,&rdquo; he can take the opportunity to say, &ldquo;Right! Let us pray together.&rdquo; She will surely agree with him. Such mutual speaking would be wonderful!</p>
<p>Married couples often argue when they eat together. If a husband criticizes another sister&rsquo;s cooking, his wife will not be offended, but if he appreciates another sister&rsquo;s cooking, his wife will become suspicious. She might say, &ldquo;Are you saying that my cooking is not good?&rdquo; Eventually, this will lead them to argue. If at such a time they would speak to one another with hymns or with verses, the works of the flesh will be abolished.</p>
<p>The Bible teaches us to speak hymns to one another. Hymns are rhythmic and can be compared to proverbs. In Chinese the hymns have couplets and rhymes and are appealing to the ear. Hence, they are inspiring and suitable for speaking to one another. We should constantly practice speaking hymns to one another so that in the meetings our speaking to one another will be enjoyable. Christian meetings of the church should be rich in mutuality. They should not have only one person speaking and the rest listening.</p>
