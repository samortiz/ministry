   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE ANOINTED OF JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Isaiah 61:1-3 is a prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A. This Prophecy Having a Foretaste Fulfillment</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>at Christ's First Coming</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah had a foretaste fulfillment at Christ's first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament, we cannot see the two comings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It shows us only that Christ will have one coming.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The two comings of Christ can be likened to two peaks of a mountain range.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They may only look like one peak from a distance, but when you come near them, you can see that there are two peaks with a big valley, a big plain, between them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The prophecy concerning the coming of Christ in Isaiah 61 is actually in two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the New Testament, the peak of the Lord's first coming is mentioned in Luke 4.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Luke 4 speaks of the Lord entering into a synagogue on the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him, and He read the first few verses of Isaiah 61.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then the Lord rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, sat down, and said, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing" v. 21 . All of them marveled at the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth v. 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Luke 4 gives us a record of the first "peak" of the prophecy in Isaiah 61:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in Isaiah 61 itself we can see only one peak, not two peaks.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The final twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah, from Isaiah 40 through 66, speak about Christ's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaiah told us that the Lord's coming will bring in the time of restoration, the restoration of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when we come to Isaiah 40 66 today, in the view of the New Testament light, we can see two comings here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For instance, Isaiah 40 speaks of the glory of Jehovah being revealed v. 5 and of the Lord Jehovah coming with might v. 10 . This refers to Jesus' appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That appearing surely is not His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was His first coming ushered in by John the Baptist vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3-5; Luke 3:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The chapters following Isaiah 40 contain many verses telling us about Christ's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Isaiah 53 tells us that the Lord comes as a tender plant, as a root out of dry ground v. 2 , and as a man of sorrows v. 3 . This surely refers to His first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we know this, but in the ancient times they did not have this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I doubt even whether Isaiah knew this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They only knew that Messiah would come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To them there was only one coming.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But actually Messiah, the Anointed One of Jehovah, will come two times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first time is for the age of grace, and the second time will be for the age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The age of grace is a foretaste of the age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews 6 tells us that the age of grace is a foretaste of the power of the coming age v. 5 . Today we are enjoying the power of the coming age, the age of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This coming age is the age of the kingdom, the age of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we get into the age of grace, we are walking toward the next age, the age of restoration, the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What we are enjoying today is the foretaste, but this foretaste will have a full taste in the time of restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first fulfillment of the prophecy concerning Christ's coming is a foretaste, whereas the second fulfillment is the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah had a foretaste fulfillment, at Christ's first coming, for the age of grace, in producing the church, as the acceptable year of Jehovah Luke 4:16-22a .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Old Testament, the church was hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church was hidden between the two peaks of Christ's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the Lord read Isaiah 61:1-2, He sat down and said, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing" Luke 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That meant that since the Lord was there, that was the acceptable year of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But this was just a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The acceptable year of Jehovah will come in full when Christ comes the second time.</S>
