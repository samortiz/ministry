   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING OBEDIENCE IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to see that it is difficult to practice obedience in the world or in the universe, but it is spontaneous to submit to authority in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is hard not to submit in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 12 Paul shows us the Body ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today some people are fighting for a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are in the Body, everything becomes one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since the time of creation God has been manifesting His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today is the age of the church; we are in the fourth stage.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only in the church, that is, in the Body of Christ, do we find a perfect relationship between submission and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is hard to ask children to submit to their parents, wives to submit to their husbands, or servants to submit to their masters in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is hard to find a person who happily pays taxes to a customs officer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the Lord is asking us to learn obedience in the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first place to learn submission is not in the family or the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Unless we learn obedience in the church, we will not obey in the family or obey the government, because we will not have the proper foundation of obedience in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are many members in the Body of Christ, and there are many opportunities to learn obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we learn the proper lessons in the Body, we will do well in every other relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have seen many brothers and sisters who obey their parents only because they have learned obedience in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First we learn obedience from the Lord and the church, and then we will have proper relationships with others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church is the test of our obedience to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unless a man learns these lessons in the church and tears down his individualism there, he will not know how to behave himself anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is the testing ground; it is also the perfecting ground.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not learn our lessons here, we will fail in everything else we do.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we learn our lessons well in the church, the problem of the kingdom, of the world, and even of the entire universe will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AUTHORITY AND SUBMISSION BEING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PERFECTLY JOINED AS ONE IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's work is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything depends on us today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is recovering His system of authority; His authority must be recovered in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not wish to see even the slightest trace of rebellion in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way to go on today is to live the Body life, where authority is complemented by mutual love and coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once this problem is settled, all other problems are settled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the past the truth of authority and submission was objective and impersonal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Authority was objective, and so was submission.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Authority was impersonal, and so was submission.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We submitted to outward things in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today authority and submission have to become organic; they have to become inward and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Body of Christ, that is, in the church, authority and submission meet in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The two become a subjective and living whole.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Authority and submission become one living entity, a oneness in life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the highest form of divine authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No other oneness can be compared with the oneness of the Head with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Head and the Body are fully one; there is no possibility of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Previously, authority was one thing and submission another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today in the Body of Christ there is no separation between them; they have become inseparably one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Body is the place where God's authority is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is also the place where submission is practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the place where one touches God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is also the ultimate expression of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Authority and submission reach their peak in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the Body of Christ is the peak!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we cannot learn submission in the church, we will not learn it anywhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not take this way, we will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If God cannot get through in this matter, He cannot get through in other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May we learn our lesson here.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without this, we do not have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The one place where we will touch authority on earth is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we learn this lesson well, we will get through in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to learn to touch God's authority, not man's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Head is in the church and so are all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not touch authority here, we will not touch it anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>May the Lord have mercy on us.</S>
