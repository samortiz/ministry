In the Bible there are many wonderful stories: one tells us about a prostitute who was saved, one about a robber who was saved, one about a tax collector who was saved, and even one about a bad Pharisee who was saved. Today we will talk about a lame boy who was saved.</P><P>Most of the people sitting here have read the Bible. When we talk about friendship in the Bible, we often mention David and Jonathan. Some secular writers also use the story of David and Jonathan as an example of love between friends. But today I want to speak about how David graciously treated Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth, and about Mephibosheth's gratitude to David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MEPHIBOSHETH BEING LAME<br>(2 SAMUEL 4:4)</H2><P>Second Samuel 4:4 says, "And Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up, and fled: and it came to pass, as she made haste to flee, that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth."</P><P>Please pay special attention to the fact that Mephibosheth's grandfather, Saul, was David's enemy. Many times he persecuted David and wanted to put him to death. He was a great enemy of David. When Saul and Jonathan were killed, Mephibosheth's nurse took him and fled quickly. She thought that since both his grandfather and father were dead, David might come to avenge and kill Mephibosheth if they did not flee fast. The boy fell on the ground and became lame because she was running too fast. Consider for a moment: does this not look like the picture of a sinner before God?</P><P>Man has misunderstood God! I say again: man has misunderstood our God! Because man has devious thoughts about God, he thinks that God also has devious thoughts about him. Because man hates God, he thinks that God also hates him. Man knows that he has sinned, and he thinks that God hates him. Mephibosheth thought, "My grandfather was David's enemy; therefore, David must hate me. I have no love for David; therefore, David must have no love for me." This is the way we also think. We think that God has no love for us because we have no love for God. We think that God cannot love us because we hate God. But God is not the same as we. Mephibosheth had no ground to receive grace, yet he received it. The same is true with regard to us and God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DAVID SHOWING MEPHIBOSHETH KINDNESS<br>(2 SAMUEL 9:1-13)</H2><P>"And David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul, that I may show him kindness for Jonathan's sake?" (v. 1). God is also asking, "Is there yet any that is left of Adam, that I may show him grace?" David showed Mephibosheth kindness for the sake of Jonathan; God graced the sinners because of His Son Jesus. People make a great mistake in thinking that God hates man. They think that man has to do a great deal of good before God's face will be turned to them. Yet they are not sure how much good should be done before God will stop His wrath, consider them, and be pleased with them. But Mephibosheth had no position at all before David. David did not know Mephibosheth. David only knew Mephibosheth's father, Jonathan. He was gracious to Mephibosheth for Jonathan's sake. Mephibosheth did not have to do anything good before he could receive David's favor. Mephibosheth had no position at all before David. He received kindness not because of himself but because of another person. This is true for a sinner before God. Many people think, "I must do something good before I can please God." But the Bible tells us that God loves us without a reason. We did not have any position before God, and we should not have obtained His grace. But we have our Jonathan, Jesus Christ. God has graced us because of Him. We are saved because we have the Lord Jesus before God. With the Lord, we can come before God.</P><P>The universities in the old times required two years of pre-university studies. Some medical schools required three years of preparation. But to obtain salvation, there is no need to enter any pre-university. Many people think that they have to prepare themselves before they can win back God's heart. But I can tell you that there is no need to do anything to please God. There is no place in the Bible that says that God wants to be reconciled to us. The Bible only says that we need to be reconciled to God. God is reconciled to us already! God gave His Son to us because He loved us. He did not love us only after He gave His Son to us. Someone said, "It is fortunate the Lord Jesus died so that God could love us." But there is no such thing. He gave His Son to us because He loved us.</P><P>"And the king said, Is there not yet any of the house of Saul, that I may show the kindness of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, Jonathan hath yet a son, which is lame on his feet. And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar" (vv. 3-4). Lodebar is a Hebrew word which means "a place without grass." The world today is a "Lodebar"; it can never fill up man's hunger or quench man's thirst. "Lodebar" can never satisfy our heart. Brothers and sisters, do you know that we are created for God and not for ourselves? All those who have not turned back to God will never be satisfied.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 18: Notes on Scriptural Messages (2) &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
