<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER NINE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE BATTLEFIELD<br>OF THE TWO KINGDOMS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 12:26; Acts 26:18a; Phil. 2:13; Matt. 10:19-20; Eph. 2:2; 4:17-18; 2 Cor. 4:4; Eph. 6:11-12; 2 Cor. 10:4-5; 11:2-3; Rom. 8:6</H1><P>The Bible reveals that in the universe there are three parties: God, man, and Satan. According to Genesis 2, man was placed before two trees. The tree of life signified God, and the tree of knowledge denoted Satan, the evil one. The revelation of the Bible declares that God's intention is to come into man and be one with man. Satan, however, got into man before God could do so. Satan took the first step, getting into man not according to God's way, but according to his own evil way. God's sovereignty is displayed here, for God allowed Satan a certain degree of liberty to do what he wanted with man. However, God did not allow him to do everything he wanted. The book of Job demonstrates this principle. God permitted Satan to do certain things to Job, yet He limited him (Job 1:12; 2:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF MAN</H2><P>Although God has permitted Satan to damage man, He has never allowed him to enter into the spirit of man because the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord (Prov. 20:27). God created man in a very specific way. Some people consider man as a kind of animal, but God does not consider man as an animal. None of the birds, fish, or beasts has a spirit. They are animals because they do not have a spirit. We are human beings because we have a spirit. God is Spirit, and we have a spirit. They who worship God must worship Him in spirit (John 4:24). Animals never worship God. Have you ever heard of monkeys erecting a temple and worshipping God? Have you ever seen a dog or a cat worshipping God? However, if you study world history from ancient times to the present, you will realize that man has always worshipped God. Perhaps man has not always worshipped properly, but he has always worshipped because there is a worshipping organ inside of him, his human spirit. The animals have some things in common with man, but man has something that no animals have. He has a human spirit. Therefore, we are not animals; we are human beings. The difference between animals and human beings is this one thing&#151;only man has a human spirit.</P><P>Throughout the centuries, Satan in his subtlety has covered this matter of the human spirit. Few Christians speak about the human spirit. Some even say that the human spirit is the same as the human soul. Although dogs and cats have a soul, they do not have a spirit. Our human spirit is the specific organ for worshipping God. So our spirit is both the lamp of the Lord and the sanctuary of God. According to Hebrews 4:12-16, our spirit is the Holy of Holies, the Most Holy Place. First, our spirit is the lamp of the Lord; eventually, it becomes the Holy of Holies.</P>
