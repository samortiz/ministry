<P>Very few babies die after being delivered today in the United States because after the delivery the modern hospitals have the best way to protect, shepherd, and feed them. Premature or sick babies are even put in an incubator for protection and nourishment. We should keep going back to the new ones again and again. We meet with them, not in the hall but in their homes. This kind of meeting in the homes will shepherd them and will keep us alive. To come to the hall to big meetings week after week on the one hand helped us and on the other hand killed our function. Some who came into the church life were initially very active, but eventually after attending big meetings for a length of time they became dormant and out of function with no interest and no incentive. But if we have new ones to take care of, this will be our incentive.</P><P>Our trainees have been trained not to spend too long a time at a home meeting, only twenty or at the most thirty minutes. You have to take care of two home meetings in one hour or four home meetings in two hours. When you go to the home meetings you have set up to visit all these new ones, you will be happy. Most of the nurses in the hospital who take care of the newborn babes are happy. The new ones that you have to nourish will become an incentive to you to encourage you to work for the Lord. What happiness this will be!</P><P>Then maybe once a month or every two months, the whole church can come together. What a church life that would be! How will you feel when you see forty-five of your fruit in the meeting whom you baptized in the bathtubs? Glorious! Then when the Lord comes back, you will be bold to go to Him. All the ones you brought to the Lord will be your joy and your crown at the Lord's coming (1 Thes. 2:19-20). This will change, revolutionize, and transfer the church life into another realm. This all depends on our faithfulness.</P><P>Today we say we live Christ but by what way? Just by having morning watch, reading the Bible in our home, and coming to the meetings on the Lord's day? If we are living Christ, we will release Christ out of our being to bear fruit, and our fruit will remain. This is the real church life and the real Christian life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PUTTING THE NEW WAY INTO PRACTICE<br>TO SEE THE LORD'S BLESSING</H2><P>Your success in the new way depends upon your practice. With the right practice, you will eventually discover all the necessary details. But I assure you the blessing will be there with you. The Lord will bless your knocking on doors. The Lord will bless your setting up home meetings, and He will bless all the home meetings if you will practice this way according to what I have instructed. Do not use any natural way. The natural way will not work. Go strictly according to the instruction of the Lord's new way. If you will be faithful to put all these things into practice, there will be some among you to help you to understand all the fine details.</P><P>I believe everyone can bring in one a month and that the home meetings will be very much blessed. The new ones will learn to go out knocking on doors, to take care of their home meetings, and after two or three years to teach others. Then you have to seek the Lord's leading when to set up the Lord's table with them. Maybe after a certain time they can have the Lord's table meeting. You have to teach them how to live the Christian life, including their giving something to the Lord. Do not use the old way; everything must be new. Then you will see the Lord's blessing. This is the way for the Lord to carry out His eternal economy that He may prepare His bride for His second coming.</P>
