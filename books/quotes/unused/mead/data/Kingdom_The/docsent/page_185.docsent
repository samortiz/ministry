   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRIED BY FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to 1 Corinthians 3:12-15.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These verses are very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>. These verses tell us that all our works will be tried by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we build with gold, silver, and precious stones, they will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we build with wood, hay, and stubble, they will be consumed by the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our work abides at that time, we shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not say that we shall receive salvation, but a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In addition to our salvation, we shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, it does not say that if a man's work is burned, he will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It says he shall suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To suffer loss does not mean to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The last part of the verse says that he himself shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not comfort yourself, however, by saying that as long as you are saved, you are okay.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don't neglect the words "as through fire."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What do the words "as through fire" mean?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not know, but I do know that the pure Word of the Scripture says that we shall be saved "as through fire" at the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Certainly this will not be a pleasant experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Don't think that these verses in 1 Corinthians apply to the Jews, or that this is a dispensational matter which does not apply to the believers in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Please remember this was a letter written to the Gentile believers in the city of Corinth, which was a city in Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was a letter written to those who call upon the name of the Lord Jesus in every place 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This means this letter is also written to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must take heed to this word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we have been saved we will never lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once God gives you salvation, it is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The suffering of loss does not refer to losing salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our God is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even parents in dealing with their children are not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When they are good, they may give them some good things as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they are bad, they may punish them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If even earthly parents have this kind of wisdom, how much more wisdom does our heavenly Father have!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>RECEIVING THE PRIZE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians 9:24-27 continues the same concept.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>So run, that ye may obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In these verses Paul said that he feared he would become a castaway.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Does this mean he feared he might perish?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This simply means he feared he might lose the prize, the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because of his fear, he exercised discipline to keep his body under subjection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The word "castaway" actually means to be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means to be rejected from the prize, not from salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After we have been saved, we have to run the race properly, and we have to fight the battle in the right way.</S>
