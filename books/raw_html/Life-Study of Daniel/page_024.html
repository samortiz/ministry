<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S PRAISE CONCERNING GOD</H2><P>In 4:1-3 we have Nebuchadnezzar's praise concerning God in His greatness, might, eternal kingdom, and everlasting dominion. In verses 2 and 3 he said, "It pleases me to declare the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me. How great are His signs, / And how mighty are His wonders! / His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, / And His dominion is from generation to generation."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S TESTIMONY</H2><P>Verses 4 through 18 are a record of Nebuchadnezzar's testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Seeing a Dream, and the Magicians<br>and Chaldeans Not Being Able to Interpret It</H2><P>Verse 5 says, "I saw a dream and it frightened me, and the imaginings upon my bed and the visions of my head alarmed me." He decreed that the wise men of Babylon make the interpretation known to him. However, the magicians, conjurers, Chaldeans, and diviners could not interpret the dream to Nebuchadnezzar (vv. 6-7).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Daniel Coming In to Interpret the Dream</H2><P>Eventually Daniel came in to interpret the dream. Nebuchadnezzar told him about the dream and then asked him to make the interpretation known to him (vv. 8-18).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. DANIEL'S INTERPRETATION OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S DREAM</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Daniel Being Appalled and Alarmed</H2><P>Having heard of the dream, Daniel was appalled for a while and his thoughts alarmed him. When Nebuchadnezzar told him not to be alarmed, Daniel said, "My lord, may the dream be for those who hate you, and its interpretation for your enemies!" (v. 19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Great Tree Signifying Nebuchadnezzar</H2><P>In his dream Nebuchadnezzar saw a great, strong, tall tree, beautiful in foliage, rich in fruit, and good for food. This tree signified Nebuchadnezzar himself (vv. 20-22).</P>
