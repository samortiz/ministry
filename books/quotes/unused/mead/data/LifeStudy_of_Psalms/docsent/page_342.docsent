   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE CONSUMMATE PRAISE Scripture Reading: Psa 146 150</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will cover the last five psalms, Psalms 146 through 150.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because each of these psalms begins and ends with the word "Hallelujah," these five psalms are called Hallelujah psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Septuagint says that Psalms 146 to 149 were written by Haggai and Zechariah after their return from captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The return of God's people from captivity was a great release and restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some expositors say that the five books of the Psalms correspond to the five books of the law written by Moses: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Other expositors say that the Psalms are an abstract of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Certain expositors exalt Psalms 146 through 150.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, these psalms reveal very little concerning God's economy and dispensing, for when they were written the "spiritual civilization" was still quite primitive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since the book of Psalms was written, the divine revelation in the Scriptures has progressed very much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, Psalms 146 through 150 cannot compare with the book of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I. THIS CONSUMMATE PRAISING CORRESPONDING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WITH THAT AT THE END OF REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have entitled this message on Psalms 146 through 150 "The Consummate Praise."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This consummate praise corresponds with that at the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Revelation 19:1 says, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The salvation and the glory and the power are of our God."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here God is praised for His salvation, glory, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 6 says, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>PRAISING JEHOVAH FOR HIS REIGNING FROM ZION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Psalm 146 is on praising Jehovah for His reigning from Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A. He Being the Help of His Saints</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 3 through 5 are a praise to Jehovah for His being the help of His saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verses 3 and 4 we have the background of the psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 3 says, "Do not trust in princes,/In a son of man, with whom there is no salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Haggai and Zechariah, who were born in captivity, saw the kings of Babylon and Persia, and this was why they said that we should not trust in princes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 4, referring to a son of man, says, "His breath goes forth; he returns to the earth;/On that day his plans perish."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The plans of the Babylonian and Persian kings perished.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 5 continues, "Blessed is the man whose help is the God of Jacob,/Whose hope is in Jehovah his God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The writer knew that the returned captives were the blessed ones.</S>
