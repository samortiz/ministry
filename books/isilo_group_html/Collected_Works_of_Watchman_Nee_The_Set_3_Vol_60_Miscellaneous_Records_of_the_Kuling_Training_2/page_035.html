God is eager to dispense His grace to the world, but He is held back by man's sin. Sin hinders God from dispensing His grace to man. Isaiah 59:1-2 says, "Behold, Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save; / Nor is His ear so heavy that it cannot hear. / But your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God, / And your sins have hidden His face / From you so that He does not hear." John 9:31 says, "We know that God does not hear sinners." We should read these verses to a sinner. This is the third step.</p><p>We should not preach a gospel which tries to bring men to God without the need of prayer. I am afraid that there is no such gospel. We must help a sinner to make a turn to God. God is willing to dispense His gift to man, and He will always dispense His gift to man. Man's sinfulness, however, prevents God from answering his prayer and petition. This brings us one step further, from a sense of need to a sense of sin. In preaching the gospel, we should let the sinner see God's gift. After this we should let him see what kind of God He is, and then let him see his own sins. As long as we can get a person to come to God, the question of His existence will not pose a problem. Bringing a person to God is easier than trying to prove His existence. After we have done this, we should awaken him to a sense of sin. After he becomes conscious of his own sin, we have reached the fourth step.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cross of the Lord Jesus</h2><p>The fourth step is to show the sinner the cross of the Lord Jesus. Only the cross can solve the problem of man's sin. We can ask a sinner to read Hebrews 9:27-28, 1 Peter 2:24, and 3:18. We only need to read these few passages with him. We do not have to speak too much about the doctrine of the cross. All we need is to let a sinner know that the Lord Jesus has borne our sins. This simple preaching is all that is needed. As preachers of the gospel, we must not interrupt our own message. We should never try to be omniscient or try to explain everything clearly. We only have to speak a little; we should not lead the listeners into detours. Rather, we should use simple words and use our own testimony.</p><p>Concerning the Lord's crucifixion for us, we can consider a few types in the Bible. The first is the Lord Jesus as the ark. God's judgment fell on Him, and we who are in Him are spared from judgment. The second is the Lord Jesus as the Lamb. He was slain for our sins and transgressions, and His blood was shed for our redemption. The third is the Lord Jesus as the brass serpent being hung on the pole for sinners. As soon as sinners look up to Him, they are saved. The Lord's crucifixion is also like the offering of the sacrifices in the Old Testament. He is the Lamb of God, sacrificing Himself for our redemption. In preaching the gospel, we only need to let sinners know the simple fact of the Lord's crucifixion. As long as they believe, they will be saved by the redemption of the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">KEYS TO PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2><p>The above four steps constitute a direct way to preach to the awakened sinners. Through these four steps, we can easily bring them to God. These are basic truths; they are also simple truths. We want to bring men to salvation with the least amount of truth. We want them to know these four things because the thoughts of sinners are totally in darkness. Their mind is not open to God, their emotion does not desire God, and there is no room in their judgment for God. We have to use the above four steps to lead them to a proper desire and decision. This is what we called "clinchers" in the earlier chapters. The goal of our preaching is to create a desire for God within sinners.</p><p>Mr. Wilkes said that we have to pray for the sinners, believe for them, and even receive for them. This is true. He meant that we have to feel the sins of the sinners; we have to feel as if their sins are our sins, and that together we have offended the Lord and rejected Him. We should join ourselves to their confession and even to their believing. When they believe, we believe. As they repent, we repent. The two are joined as one. When we deny the world, we are denying the world with and for them. When we accept the Lord, we are accepting Him with and for them. We should join them in prayer, in believing, and in receiving. In this way, sinners will be brought to the Lord easily.</p><p>A gospel preacher must be burning in his heart. A cold person cannot save others. For this reason, we must first be kindled ourselves with fire before we can kindle others with the same fire. Only one who identifies himself with those who are about to be saved and feels the same as they do can bring about their salvation.</p><p>Next, we have to preach a gospel that speaks of things that are here with us today. We should not preach a gospel that merely speaks of things that happened two thousand years ago. God's gospel is like the manna; it must be fresh and living every day.</p><p>Third, we have to grind ourselves into fine powder before we can touch others' feelings in a tender way. We have to echo the sinners' feelings. We have to bear the sinners on our shoulder and carry them to salvation. Our words have to be clinchers, but even more our very person has to be a clincher. A gospel preacher has to possess a certain rare power, a power that will electrify others. He has to be an "electric conductor,"  and he has to join himself to sinners and pass on this "electricity" to them. We have to be receivers and conductors, those who can pass electricity on to others at will. We have to waste our lives before we can do the work of soul saving. Paul was one who gave up everything for the gospel's sake. He was willing to spend and be spent for others' souls (2 Cor. 12:15). He was not only good at preaching; he was able to waste himself on behalf of others. Paul is a good example to us.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 60: Miscellaneous Records of the Kuling Training (2) &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
