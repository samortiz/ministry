   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When we believe in God, spontaneously we will not worry and strive.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We will not do these things; this is the negative works of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The negative works of faith are important and necessary, but they are not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After one has faith, he still needs the positive works of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have previously mentioned that there are things that we should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now, through the power of God, there are things that we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our positive works must match our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, these works complete our faith, and we receive the promised blessings of God much sooner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not a matter of hastiness in the flesh, but an expression of the strength of the power in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God would like to give us what we need immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But, if the death of our natural life is not substantial and deep enough, an immediate answer would strengthen our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Until our own life has lost all possibility of being active again, God has to delay what He has long promised.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Positive works are a death-blow to our self-life and an expression of the vigor of spiritual strength.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, they will accelerate the accomplishment of God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What are the positive works of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are to walk and act as if we have received God's promises.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, we believe that something is already accomplished and behave as if it is already accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us consider a few matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suppose you are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God may give you a personal promise that you will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the negative side, you should rest in God's work and not disturb His work by any human means.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, you should commit yourself to the hand of the Almighty without worry or concern.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the positive side, there are important steps that you should take.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You should walk as if you are a healed person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You do not have to wait until you are really healed before you can consider yourself healed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God gives you the faith to believe that you are healed, at that moment you are healed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are healed, you should act like you are healed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, when you receive faith, you should ask, "How should I act if I am a healed person who has been restored by God?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Should I lie on my bed for a long time, or should I stand up to walk?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should walk as if you are a healed person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, this must be done after you have received a promise from God and must be carried out in complete reliance on God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Otherwise, the result will be a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true in regards to trusting in God for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although sometimes we may be in great want, what we look toward is a fountain and not a bucket.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not worry or be tempted to borrow Rom 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the God-ordained principle of giving, we should still be very generous.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we trust in God when we are in trials, we should not tell others, hint at help from others, or resort to other methods.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should live as if nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Other matters such as peace within the family, occupations, livelihoods, sufferings, dangers, and other similar matters should follow the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to know that God is not only interested in our spiritual affairs; He is equally concerned with the many matters related to our physical being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the characteristic of faith: faith does not wait until something is done before believing, because then there is no need to believe anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Faith is exercised before something is accomplished and believes, based on God's promises, that it has already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus' teaching concerning faith is, "Believe that you have received them, and you will have them" Mark 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Faith is not believing after receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, it is believing, before ever receiving, that one has received.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the most profound aspect of the law of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nevertheless, we have mentioned that faith must be expressed through works.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, when one believes that he has received, he should act as if he has received.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such work is very spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The eyes of faith do not see dark clouds in the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Rather, they see an unchanging sun above the dark clouds.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Physical eyes can only see the present darkness, but the eyes of faith can see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They do not imagine; they actually see.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Is not the light they see more real than the darkness the world sees?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Faith despises all dangers, sufferings, and trials, for it knows what the end will be.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The work of faith is not a risk but a sure and practical act.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It sees what others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Although others may consider such acts dangerous, these "dangers" have been well thought through, prayed about, promised by God, and taught by the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a person has not received the teaching of the Scriptures or the promise of the Holy Spirit in his spirit, forcing himself to do such acts is indeed a risk.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But for a believer who has truly received God's revelation and has faith, these acts are spontaneous and unpretentious because they are the most natural result of his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Although many believers have never heard these teachings yet, God has been leading them this way already.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the work of our faith is something conscious, artificial, and pretentious, we have not yet learned the lesson of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although all the works of faith are beyond human reason, they are carried out according to the principle of one's living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This one has received God's promise and knows what is going to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, he acts ahead of others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The works of faith are often the works that glorify God.</S>
