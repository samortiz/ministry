   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Moon</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 2:16-17 also indicates that Christ is the new moon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The new moon signifies a new beginning with light in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As such a new moon to us, Christ affords us a new beginning with light in this dark age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is also what we experience and enjoy of Christ as our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the process of our growth, again and again we need Christ to be our fresh start, our new beginning, which is signified by the new moon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>30.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Sabbath</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Colossians 2:16-17 also shows us that Christ is the real Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Sabbath signifies completion and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After God completed His work of creation on the sixth day, He enjoyed rest on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God blessed the seventh day and made it the Sabbath Gen 2:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, after man was created, man did not work first; instead, man first enjoyed rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To enjoy rest before work this is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The significance of Christ's being our Sabbath is that we do not work but enter into what He has accomplished and rest in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ has accomplished all His work and is sitting on the right hand of God in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now He is in our spirit to be our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Feasts are yearly, new moons monthly, Sabbaths weekly, and eating and drinking daily.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Daily we eat and drink Christ, weekly we have completion and rest in Him, monthly we experience a new beginning in Him, and throughout the year we experience Him as our joy and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly Christ is to us the reality of every positive thing and is for our enjoyment and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>31.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Armor</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is also our armor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 6:11 says, "Put on the whole armor of God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To defeat God's enemy, the devil, the believers need to put on the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To fight the spiritual warfare, we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our weapons do not avail, but God's armor, even the whole armor of God, does avail.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The whole armor of God is for the entire Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers are parts of this unique warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only the corporate warrior, not an individual believer, can wear the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, we must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body of Christ, not individually.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ephesians 6:14-17 shows us six aspects of Christ as our armor: the girdle of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the firm foundation of the gospel of peace the shoes , the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of these six items of Christ as our armor, only the sword is for offensive warfare against the enemy; all the other items are for defense.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must put on Christ as the whole armor of God that we may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil v. 11 . These stratagems are the devil's evil plan.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only does the devil have an evil will, but he also has subtle stratagems to work out his will.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we want to stand against these stratagems, we must put on Christ as our armor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To us the armor has six aspects:</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>a. The Girdle of Truth</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ephesians 6:14 says, "Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For us to gird our loins with truth is to strengthen our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the purpose of standing, our whole being needs to be strengthened with truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and experienced by us as our living John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our whole being for spiritual warfare.</S>
