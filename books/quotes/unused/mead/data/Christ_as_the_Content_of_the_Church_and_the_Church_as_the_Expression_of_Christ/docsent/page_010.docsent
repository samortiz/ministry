   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Enjoyment of Christ as Our Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually, our natural man including the will, the self, the flesh, the "I" must be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The "I" has to be broken, riven, torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we will get into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are walking in the spirit and not in our natural life, we will enjoy Christ as the glory of God in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We will have Christ expressed among us and through us as the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the expression of Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not only have Christ as righteousness in our behavior and holiness in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should also have Him as our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the natural life, the self, the flesh, the "I," has been put away and we are in the spirit, the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are in the spirit, we can sense that we have Christ as the glory expressed among us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the outer court we see the white linen, and in the Holy Place we see the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The most significant thing in the Holy of Holies is the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory is the very content of the church life, and the church is the expression of such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In these days we expect that such a local expression of Christ will be raised up in many places.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is God's intention, and this is what His enemy is trying to frustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can never be built together in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The acacia wood of the standing boards of the tabernacle signifies our regenerated, resurrected, uplifted, and reinforced human nature, not our natural human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In our untransformed human nature, we cannot be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The stronger we become in our natural man, the more independent we are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The weaker we become, the more we become limited and dependent on others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to be overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we enjoy Christ more and more, the increasing measure of Christ unites us with others in God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In ourselves we are too independent and can never stand with others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But when we enjoy Christ, we are being overlaid with Him, and the Christ whom we enjoy unites us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we enjoy Christ, the more unity we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>EATING CHRIST AS OUR SPIRITUAL FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to stress the matter of eating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the altar in the outer court, there was the eating of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the showbread table in the Holy Place, there was the eating of the showbread.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also, in the Holy of Holies within the ark was the golden pot with the hidden manna Heb 9:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This signifies the Christ eaten, digested, and assimilated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to put Christ on as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we also have to eat of Him to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We feast on Him at the altar in the outer court and at the showbread table in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also enjoy Him as our inward, hidden supply in the ark in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We enjoy Christ subjectively by feasting on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all have to learn to feast on Christ day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we feast on Him, He will sanctify us, transform us, and conform us to His image.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then there can be the building up of the church as the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The content of the church is Christ Himself as righteousness, holiness, and glory, and the church is the expression of such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When there is such an expression in our locality, both we and the Lord will be satisfied to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we have such a church life, we will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our being satisfied means that the Lord is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This must be our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must go on by His grace to attain this goal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In all of the localities we must build up such a glorious expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the ultimate recovery of the Lord.</S>
