        <h2 class="head1">NEEDING A VISION TO SERVE THE LORD</h2>
<p>All God&rsquo;s serving ones must have a vision. From the Old Testament to the New Testament, every serving one of God had a vision. Abel offered sheep based on vision and revelation. Cain&rsquo;s offering of the fruit of the ground, however, was not according to vision or revelation. Many Bible readers feel that God was unfair to Cain. Both brothers brought an offering, but God had regard only for Abel&rsquo;s offering, not for Cain&rsquo;s offering (Gen. 4:3-6). When I first read this account, I felt that way, but gradually I realized that Abel offered sheep according to a vision, whereas Cain offered something out of himself. Abel&rsquo;s offering was based on a vision; God showed him the way, and he made an offering according to God&rsquo;s way. Thus, his offering was accepted by God (3:21; Heb. 11:4). Cain followed his own way with no regard for God&rsquo;s heart. Thus, God could not accept his offering. This can be likened to a servant doing something with no regard for his master&rsquo;s instructions. No master would hire such a servant.</p>
<p>Noah built the ark because he received a vision from God, not because he had a personal dream. In regard to the ark, he did according to all that God commanded him (Gen. 6:13-22). Similarly, Abraham&rsquo;s decision to leave Ur of the Chaldeans was not initiated by a personal decision but by a vision that he received from God (12:1-4).</p>
<p>The children of Israel were brought out of Egypt by Moses because he was sent by God, who said to him, &ldquo;I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt&rdquo; (Exo. 3:10). Later, God established the passover and, through Moses, instructed the children of Israel to prepare the lamb, to put its blood on the doorposts and lintel, and to eat the flesh of the lamb and the unleavened bread with their loins girded, sandals on their feet, and a staff in their hand (12:1-14) so that they could go out from the Egyptians (11:1-8; 14:1-31). All this was according to a vision that God gave to Moses. God commanded him, and he brought the children of Israel out according to God&rsquo;s command. After bringing the children of Israel into the wilderness, Moses did not presume to set up the tabernacle, altar, Ark, and golden lampstand according to his own pattern. Rather, he received revelation from God during the forty days that he was in God&rsquo;s presence. Moses built according to this heavenly pattern, and he set up the priesthood according God&rsquo;s instruction (24:12, 17-18; 25:1&mdash;31:11; 35:1&mdash;40:38). This involved service with revelation.</p>
<p>When Joshua succeeded Moses, God said to him, &ldquo;Arise, and cross over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them, to the children of Israel...Be strong and take courage, for you will cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them&rdquo; (Josh. 1:2, 6). When God revealed, Joshua acted. Samuel, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel also were prophets with vision. No prophet served God without vision and revelation.</p>
<p>This was the situation in the Old Testament, but even more, it was the situation in the New Testament. The Gospels record the Lord Jesus leading His disciples for three and a half years, giving them vision and revelation so that they would receive heavenly sight. When the Lord died and resurrected, the Spirit of reality guided the disciples further into all the reality (John 16:13). The Epistles of Paul are full of vision and revelation (2 Cor. 12:1; Eph. 3:3-5). This is especially true of Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, which was written by the apostle John. <em>Revelation</em> in Greek means &ldquo;an unveiling of a mystery that has been hidden.&rdquo; The Lord showed John great revelations through many visions and signs, which became the content of the book of Revelation. Hence, the New Testament, from the Gospels to Revelation, is full of visions and revelations that God gave to man. We must have vision and revelation in order to serve God today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO SEE A VISION</h2>
<p>How can we see a vision? What is the way to receive a revelation? Although the circumstances related to seeing a vision and receiving a revelation are not the same for every person, the principles are the same. Visions come from God; they do not depend upon anything of our self. If God wants us to see, we will see; if God does not let us see, we cannot see. Nevertheless, we still bear some responsibility related to our heart, to our willingness to let go of worthless things, to wait on the Lord, to be pure in heart, and to be open to the Lord.</p>
<p>Although Paul was not seeking visions or revelations, God gave him a revelation (Acts 9:1-6). This was not only the case with Paul but also with Moses. Moses had completely forgotten about the children of Israel when he was shepherding sheep on Mount Horeb. Nevertheless, God came and charged him to lead the children of Israel out of Egypt (Exo. 3:1-10). Neither Paul nor Moses was seeking visions, but God gave them visions. It may seem as if they had no heart for God, but when we carefully look at the Old Testament and the New Testament, we can see that both Moses and Paul had a heart for God. Before Moses saw a vision from God, he struck down an Egyptian in an effort to deliver the children of Israel with his own strength. Even though he failed and fled to the wilderness (2:11-15), God remembered Moses&rsquo; heart for His people. Although his way was wrong, his heart was acceptable to God. The psalm of Moses says, &ldquo;The days of our years are seventy years, / Or, if because of strength, eighty years&rdquo; (Psa. 90:10). According to his own evaluation, his life was over when he was eighty years old. His way and his strength were completely gone. Nevertheless, this was the time when God gave him a vision, and God&rsquo;s vision was based on the desire that Moses had expressed forty years earlier. Paul&rsquo;s way was wrong as well; he was like an ox kicking the goads. This, however, did not mean that he did not want to serve God. Although Paul did not know God before he was saved, he had a heart to serve God. In this service, he even killed Christians. With even this misguided zeal, God gave Paul a vision. It is hard to find a case in the Bible of someone who had no heart for God suddenly receiving a vision. At a minimum, a person needs to have some heart for God in order to receive a vision.</p>
<p>Second, in order to see a vision, one must forsake the worthless and choose the precious (2 Tim. 2:21; Jer. 15:19). Everything of God is precious; everything that is not of God is worthless. God&rsquo;s children today cannot see visions or receive revelations, because they regard worthless things as precious. Some brothers and sisters have been in the church for nearly two decades, but their knowledge of the Lord is the same as it was twenty years ago because they treasure what is in their hands, whether it be material riches, business, or family matters, or even the spiritual lessons they learned years ago.</p>
<p>It is odd that they do not hold on to the precious but to the worthless. Even when they listen to messages, they do not receive the precious things. This is like eating the rind of a watermelon rather than the flesh of the watermelon. Some people cannot hear the central, precious word but only the superficial word. For example, a brother once asked me, &ldquo;If Jacob had four wives, why do we say that a man should have only one wife?&rdquo; I do not like to reply to these kinds of questions. Such questions are not even &ldquo;rinds&rdquo;; they are like mud on a watermelon rind. I wanted to say, &ldquo;David murdered someone, took his wife, and committed adultery. Should we learn from this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have seen many brothers and sisters who firmly hold on to what they have, but their unwillingness to let go prevents them from seeing visions. People who let go will see visions just like Paul, who dropped the Old Testament, Judaism, and the law. Only such persons can receive visions.</p>
<p>We must have a heart and be willing to let go of the worthless things. We must drop whatever we have from the past. God told Abraham to offer up Isaac, even though Isaac had been given to him from God (Gen. 22:2). This shows that even having Isaac was not equal to having God. If Abraham had refused to give up Isaac, he would have been regarding the worthless, and he would have forsaken God.</p>
<p>I would ask the elders if they regard the brothers and sisters in the church as their own children? Such a regard is right, because without such a heart, the elders are, at most, &ldquo;stepfathers.&rdquo; Every responsible brother in the church should regard the brothers and sisters as their biological children. However, if God asks the elders to leave their locality and go elsewhere, would they be willing to part from the saints? Even this should be regarded as a forsaking of the worthless for the precious. The church is precious, but in comparison to God, what is more precious? Whenever we hold firmly on to something other than God, we are finished. We do not even need to speak of holding on to matters such as the world, money, fame, or fortune. Once we hold on to something other than God, we are finished, and we will receive no vision.</p>
<p>If a brother bearing responsibility in the church cannot give up his opinions and cannot get along with the other brothers, he is finished. When I was in mainland China, brothers and sisters often said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you have a problem. You hardly ever listen to other people&rsquo;s reasonings. The more they reason, the less you listen.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;You are right, but only in one respect. I do not mind listening to other people, but a person who likes to reason cannot receive any help. Hence, when a person holds on to his reasonings, there is nothing to be gained from listening.&rdquo; A person cannot be full of light when he holds on to something worthless and refuses to let go of it. Even if he is one hundred percent correct, he should not hold on to his correct reasonings. We should choose the precious and drop the worthless in every matter and on every point.</p>
<p>When I say, &ldquo;Do not contend&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do not reason,&rdquo; I do not mean that we should be polite in order to keep the peace with others; I mean that we need to see the treasure, which is God Himself. When we give no room to anything within us other than the Lord, we will be full of light. Everything other than God is worthless; only God is valuable. If we hold on to the precious, we will be full of light and vision.</p>
<p>We also need to learn to wait on God. Daniel 10 tells us that Daniel waited on God for three full weeks (vv. 2-3). Then the messenger of God came to tell him the things to come, to show him visions.</p>
<p>Our heart also needs to be pure. The pure in heart see God (Matt. 5:8). We must desire God and nothing other than God.</p>
<p>Finally, our heart needs to turn to the Lord. Second Corinthians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.&rdquo; Once our heart is turned to the Lord, the veil is taken away. Once the veil is taken away, our face is open toward the Lord. The Lord is the vision, the revelation, itself. Our seeing of the Lord is our seeing of the vision. If we are not open to the Lord, we cannot see the vision. In summary, we need to have a heart for God, to let go of the worthless things, to wait on the Lord, to be pure in heart, and to be open to the Lord. Then the Lord will shine His light at a time when nothing is covering us inwardly.</p>
<p>Not everyone who serves God in the same age sees a vision directly. The Bible shows that Paul received a direct vision, but Timothy&rsquo;s vision was received through Paul. There is no record in the Bible of Timothy receiving a direct vision himself. Everything that Timothy saw came through Paul. Hence Paul says, &ldquo;Continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them and that from a babe you have known the sacred writings&rdquo; (2 Tim. 3:14-15). This means that Timothy received a vision from Paul and through the Bible. Hence, not everyone who serves God in this age will receive a direct vision. In any case, we all must see the same vision and receive it according to the same principles.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
