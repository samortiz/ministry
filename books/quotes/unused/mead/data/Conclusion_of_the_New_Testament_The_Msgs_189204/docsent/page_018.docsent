   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From the Lord's word in 18:20 we can realize that in the Lord's intention He did not want to have big gatherings in the local church for practical help.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Big gatherings can only be good for general teaching, but they cannot be good to give some practical help.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is nearly impossible to render any practical help in a big meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this we need a gathering of just two or three believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need a small number for our meetings so that we can take care of everyone's need practically.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 18:20 the Lord did not speak of two or three meeting together but of two or three gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The verb is not in the active voice but in the passive voice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The two or three do not meet together; they are gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By whom are they gathered?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are gathered by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we say that the two or three meet together, this meeting is initiated by those who meet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For two or three to be gathered together, however, indicates that someone is doing the gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These two or three are gathered by the unseen Lord because they love the Lord and are concerned for His members.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fact that the verb here is in the passive voice indicates that whenever we come together to meet we should not be the ones who take the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it must be the Lord who takes the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He gathers us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The meeting is initiated not by the meeting ones but by the unseen Lord who gathers them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord initiates the meeting, motivating us and gathering us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that every time we meet our meeting should not be from us but from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our meeting, therefore, is not initiated by anyone except the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every time we meet it should be He who gathers us together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord takes the initiative to gather us together into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The believers are gathered together not in the name but into the name.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The proper translation of 18:20 is not that two or three are gathered together "in My name" but "into My name."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord does not mean that we simply gather together in His name or meet in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To meet in His name is much different from being gathered together into His name.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the name denotes the person, to be gathered together into the Lord's name is to be gathered together into His person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are gathered by the Lord Jesus into His name, into His person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order for someone to come into something he must come out of something.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be gathered into the name of the Lord means to be brought out of anything that is other than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to be rescued by the Lord from so many occupying things and be gathered into His name, that is, into Himself as a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Especially we need to get out of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are to be gathered by the Lord Jesus into His name, we must get out of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we remain in the self, we cannot be gathered into the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is when we are gathered out of ourselves and out of all things other than the Lord and into Him that He is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The most crucial thing in the believers' meeting is to be gathered into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we are the Lord's and have been saved by His name, we should gather only into that name and meet in that name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must not gather into and meet in any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In a locality we should meet by small numbers, and we should meet by being gathered into the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be gathered out of so many things into His name, into His person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew 18:20 also tells us that where two or three are gathered into the Lord's name He is in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because we have been rescued and brought into the Lord's name, surely He is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now when we are gathered into His name, we enjoy His presence in a special way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His presence brings us enlightenment, grace, supply, and all kinds of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Matthew 18:15-20 we have a picture of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A local church is an expression of the Body of Christ in a certain locality composed of saints who mainly meet in small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They meet in the way of having been rescued out of all earthly occupations into Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Having been gathered into Christ, they meet in Him and have Him with them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because they meet in Him with His presence, they surely have the authority of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They may exercise this authority to deal with the Devil and the demons behind, upon, and within a sinful, rebellious brother.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the practice of the local church life revealed by the Lord Jesus to the first group of apostles.</S>
