        <h2 class="head1">THE CONSECRATION OF THE MEMBERS AND<br />
THE CONSECRATION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>The first Epistle in the New Testament, the book of Romans, is concerning the spiritual progress of a believer. The first two chapters reveal that every person, whether Jew or Gentile, is a sinner before his salvation. Chapters 3 and 4 reveal how a sinner is redeemed and justified by the blood of Christ. Chapters 5 and 6 reveal that prior to redemption, a sinner is of the old creation in Adam, being in Adam by nature. Hence, a sinner can never please God. A sinner can be accepted by God in Christ because the old creation was terminated by Christ on the cross. After being accepted by God, reconciled to God, and delighting in God, a believer needs to cooperate with God by presenting his members to God as weapons of righteousness (6:13) so that what Christ accomplished on the cross may be applied to him.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 covers the presenting of our members in detail. Formerly, we committed sins with our members, but now we should present our members to God. If we want God to apply the work of the cross in us and nullify the effects of the old creation in us, we need to cooperate with Him by presenting our members one by one. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, from today onward I present my eyes to You, I present my ears to You, and I present my mind to You. I will no longer use my eyes to look at things carelessly, my mind to think about inappropriate things, or my ears to listen to gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult for some saints to pray; they can utter only a few words. But they are very fluent and eloquent when they gossip. Their mouths are very adept at gossiping but not at praying. There are other saints who do not seem to hear the message given in a meeting, but they can clearly hear every word of gossip that is whispered in the back rows. The mouths and ears of these saints are neither consecrated to God nor ruled by Him.</p>
<p>Many saints might have yet another problem. They do not forget what they read in the newspapers, but they either do not understand, are confused about, or do not remember what they read in the Bible. The verse that they managed to memorize in the morning is forgotten by breakfast time. They know that they read the Bible but cannot recall which verses they read. According to a Chinese saying, their heart is somewhere else, and they look but do not see. Hence, their heart and eyes are not consecrated. If we consecrate our heart and eyes to God, we will concentrate on the Bible, the Word of God, instead of the newspapers. This is to present our members according to Romans 6.</p>
<p>If we present our members one by one to God, our hands will not be free to do what God does not allow. Our feet will not be free to walk on the path that God does not allow. Our mouth will not utter words that the Lord does not allow, and our ears will not listen to words that He does not allow. Paul says, &ldquo;Just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness and lawlessness...so now present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification&rdquo; (v. 19). If we genuinely experience consecration, our members will become very functional because they will serve God and be used by Him. I have seen people who were clumsy in speech, but after their consecration they gave messages, prayed, and testified eloquently.</p>
<p>There is a dear co-worker who could not speak in a clear way and whose prayers did not make sense when I first met him. However, he loved the Lord very much and had a strong consecration. Because his mouth was consecrated, he would not open his mouth to talk carelessly. When he began to serve the Lord full time, his living condition was difficult. Nevertheless, he remained in the position of his consecration and would not shrink back. A few years later, I heard him give a message and could hardly believe that he was the person speaking, because he was very eloquent. However, it was not a common eloquence but the eloquence that comes with the utterance of the Holy Spirit. He was able to speak for God because he had consecrated his mouth. He was a person who had presented his members to God.</p>
<p>God wants to work in us extensively so that He may bring us into the building up of the Body of Christ. But we first need to consecrate ourselves to Him. Our consecration should not be general; rather, we should consecrate our members one by one in a detailed way (Rom. 6). Many people are troubled by a chaotic and wild mind. For such a saint the way of salvation is to consecrate his mind to God in a definite way. Just as his mind was presented to chaotic thoughts, he now needs to present his mind to God. As soon as we pass through the door of presenting our members, we will be delivered from the old creation in Adam and live in the reality of Christ in our practical living. Hence, we need to have a thorough consecration.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 say that we were formerly in Adam, but we are now in Christ. After we see this truth, we need to present our members one by one to God. If a particular member is weak, we need to consecrate that member to God. If a sister has a tendency to gossip, she needs to consecrate her mouth and tongue in a particular way to God. If her eyes like to look at inappropriate things, she needs to thoroughly consecrate her eyes to God. If her heart is not broad, not willing to forgive others and forget their offenses, or if her heart harbors hatred because of something insignificant, then she needs to consecrate her heart to God. She needs to say, &ldquo;Lord, my heart is a captive of Satan. It is narrow; it hates, envies, blames, and condemns others, and it is not willing to forgive others. No matter how I struggle and strive, I cannot overcome. By Your grace I consecrate my heart to You.&rdquo; If she is willing to consecrate herself in such a way, her heart will change from being narrow to being broad, from hating people to loving people, and from not forgiving others to forgiving them. We need a detailed and specific consecration in order to experience Romans 5 and 6 in a practical way.</p>
<p>Chapter 7 speaks of being in the flesh, and chapter 8 speaks of being in the Holy Spirit. These two chapters show that we cannot live by the flesh. Whenever we try to please God by our flesh, we will fail. We must learn to be in spirit and walk according to the spirit, that is, to be freed by the law of the Spirit of life in Christ (8:2). We need to set our mind on the spirit, mind the things of the Spirit, and walk according to the spirit (vv. 4-6). This is deeper than consecration because it involves cooperating with the Holy Spirit in the deepest part of our being. Then we will be freed from our flesh and live in our spirit in our daily living. This is the way to be spiritual.</p>
<p>Chapters 9 through 11 do not continue the matter of spiritual experience. Rather, these chapters are an insertion and speak of God&rsquo;s selection and calling. From the standpoint of experience, chapter 12 follows chapter 8. Chapters 1 and 2 are concerning sinners. Chapters 3 and 4 are concerning the justified. Chapters 5 and 6 are concerning those who have been transferred out of Adam into Christ and have presented their members to God. Chapters 7 and 8 are concerning those who are freed from the bondage of the flesh to live in the spirit and walk according to the spirit. A person with these experiences is spiritual and lives before God.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 is concerning the Body, which is the matter of building. We who are many are members one of another in Christ as one Body. This is building (v. 5). Therefore, there is a great turn in chapter 12, and the apostle speaks about consecration again. However, this time he is not asking us to present our individual members, such as our mouth, eyes, and ears; rather, he is exhorting us to present our body. The presenting in chapter 6 is for a living that is transferred out of Adam into Christ in order to live Christ. In order to have a living that is sanctified and justified, we need to present our members. The presenting in chapter 12 is not for us to be delivered from sin in order to live a proper life but for us to become building materials. Hence, we need to present our body. In chapters 3 and 4 we are justified by God and accepted by Him, in chapters 5 and 6 we are transferred out of Adam into Christ, and in chapters 7 and 8 we are delivered out of the flesh to live in the Holy Spirit in our practical daily living. Now we are good material for God&rsquo;s building. Hence, at this critical juncture we need to consecrate our whole being again and give our entire being to God for His building. This is the last station, the last level, in our spiritual progress. To present ourselves for God&rsquo;s building in such a way is our reasonable service. Such a consecration will cause us to understand God&rsquo;s good, well-pleasing, and perfect will (12:2). Chapters 13 through 16 provide supplementary points regarding how we should conduct ourselves in the church life while we live in the spirit and are built by God into one Body. This is the line of thought that runs through the book of Romans.</p>
<p>Romans reveals that in order to be built by God, we must be consecrated persons. The first step of consecration is to overcome sins, but the second step of consecration is to be built by God. We first need to be consecrated persons with experiences of consecration, and then we can lead others into this matter.</p>
<p>After we pass through the gate of consecration, we will have many dealings, such as dealing with sins, dealing with the world, and dealing with the flesh. If we are not consecrated, we cannot experience the practical dealing, nor can we be built practically. Just as raw materials must be cut and polished before they can be used to build, so also we believers need to consecrate ourselves and surrender to God so that He may deal with the problems in our being in order to build us.</p>
<p>If as serving ones we would have extensive and adequate experiences of these things, we would be able to discern whether feeding, guiding, or cultivating and watering is the proper way to build up a person. As soon as we contact someone, we will know his spiritual condition. If he is not clear concerning his salvation, we will help him to be clear. If he is clear concerning his salvation but has not consecrated himself, we will help him in the matter of consecration. After a period of time, those who are helped and led by us should be able to be built up with others in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF A RENEWED, THOROUGH CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>We need to reconsider our consecration before the Lord and ask ourselves whether we live in the position of our consecration. We also need to consecrate ourselves to God once again for His building. If a brother consecrated himself in a general way in the past, he now needs to be definite and thorough to present his members according to Romans 6, presenting his eyes, mouth, hands, and heart. Then he must consecrate his body according to chapter 12. The consecration in chapter 6 is the consecration of our members so that we can have a proper living, but the consecration in chapter 12 is the consecration of our body so that our whole being can become building material in God&rsquo;s hand. The more thorough these two steps of consecration are, the better. There is nothing wrong with consecrating ourselves many times. Every renewed consecration will refresh our spiritual condition.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
