[1]  The Relationship between John s Writings and the Building Work of God
[2]  How the Lord Builds Up the House of God
[3]  On the one hand, our brother saw that God s eternal will, His ultimate goal, is to build a house that is the mingling and the mutual dwelling of God and man.
[4]  Although there are people in many places who love the Lord, who zealously pursue the Lord, and who pay attention to spiritual things, it is hard to find one group of Christians who have been built together to become a spiritual house in which God can dwell, a house that satisfies the needs of both God and man.
[5]  We will begin by reading a number of passages from the Bible which are all very important.
[6]  John 1:1-4 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[7]  If you ask me what the central subject of the Lord s message and concluding prayer is, I would tell you that the central subject is in. These four chapters talk about in. Here the Lord is telling the disciples, I am in the Father, but you who believe Me are not yet in the Father, because you are not in Me and I have not yet come into you.
[8]  Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 22 say, And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.
[9]  And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life.
[10]  In this conference every evening we will focus on the building of God.
[11]  In the meetings in the mornings we will give additional words concerning the building of God by reading some portions of the Scriptures.
[12]  Second, we have said repeatedly that God s work of building in the universe is to have a dwelling place in which He Himself, and also all who belong to God, may dwell.
[13]  As we read the Gospel of John, I would like for us to pay attention to several characteristics.
[14]  This will help us to recognize the main points.
[15]  Just as in the Old Testament the tabernacle among the Israelites was the center of God s union with man, so this tabernacle of God s becoming flesh is also the center of God s union with man.
[16]  Jacob said, This is none other than the house of God v. 17 . When he rose up in the morning, immediately he took the stone that he had put under his head, set it up as a pillar, and poured oil on top of it v. 18 . He said, This stone, which I have set up as a pillar, will be God s house v. 22 . If you impress this picture into your mind and then come again to read what the Lord Jesus said, you will clearly understand its meaning.
[17]  AND SOLVE ALL OF MAN S PROBLEMS SO THAT MAN MAY BE BUILT UP AS THE HOUSE OF GOD
[18]  Now we will take a look at the main point of each chapter in the Gospel of John.
[19]  A person s words are his explanation; therefore, the Lord is the explanation of God, the expression of God.
[20]  No one has ever seen God; only He has declared God v. 18 . In Him was life v. 4 . One day He became flesh and tabernacled among men to bring life to man v. 14 .
[21]  I would ask you brothers and sisters to consider this: God wants to dwell in you as His dwelling place, and He also wants you to dwell in Him as your dwelling place.
[22]  The center of the first half, composed of chapters one through thirteen, is God s becoming flesh and coming into man.
[23]  At the beginning of chapter fourteen, therefore, the Lord said, Do not let your heart be troubled; believe into God, believe also into Me. In My Father s house are many abodes vv.
[24]  As early as chapter two, when the Lord cleansed the temple, He said, Do not make My Father s house a house of merchandise v. 16 . Many brothers and sisters realize without difficulty that the Father s house in this verse refers to the temple at that time.
[25]  The strange thing is this: Bible expositors agree unanimously that God s house in the Old Testament refers to the temple, while God s house in the New Testament refers to the church, yet the Father s house mentioned in John 14:2 is considered the unique exception and interpreted as heaven.
[26]  We have mentioned repeatedly that the Gospel of John shows us that God in His Son coming to be man s life was for Him to build a temple, which is His house.
[27]  The Lord s becoming flesh was His tabernacling among men.
[28]  When the Lord became flesh, He provided God with a tabernacle to dwell among men, yet this tabernacle was limited to only one individual.
[29]  This was what the Lord referred to in John 1: You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man v. 51 . We should realize that the Son of Man refers not only to the Lord Himself but also includes all those who are joined to Him in His resurrection.
[30]  The angels of God ascending and descending on this man indicates that this man is joined to heaven and has reached the earth; heaven and earth are joined in Him; and God and man are mingled together in Him.
[31]  Since the Lord s going refers not to His leaving the earth to ascend to the heavens but to His death, His going to prepare a place for us must also not be His going to heaven but His going into God to prepare a place, that is, His going to God to open a way for us, solving the problems and removing the barriers between us and God so that we who were outside of God and separated from God can enter into God and be joined to God.
[32]  And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself v. 3 . The meaning of the Greek words translated as I am coming again is difficult to render accurately.
[33]  If I go...I am coming means My going is My coming.
[34]  In other words, the Lord s going to die was His going to be resurrected.
[35]  Verses 10 through 17 say, The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works.
[36]  Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me; but if not, believe because of the works themselves.
[37]  Truly, truly, I say to you, He who believes into Me, the works which I do he shall do also; and greater than these he shall do because I am going to the Father.
[38]  And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.
[39]  Verse 19 says, Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me. I would like to ask you, brothers and sisters, exactly how long is a little while mentioned here? Is it two thousand years? Is it until the time of the Lord s second coming? If it will be at that time, then the Lord could not say the world beholds Me no longer because at His second coming the whole world will behold Him.
[40]  A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN THE LORD
[41]  Let us read on in chapter fourteen from verses 21 to 23: He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.
[42]  Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world?
[43]  Jesus answered and said to him,...He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father s who sent Me. These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you; but the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you.
[44]  TO BRING US INTO THE REALITY OF THIS UNION
[45]  Let us leave for now the remainder of chapter fifteen and read from chapter sixteen.
[46]  Verses 5 through 7a say, But now I am going to Him who sent Me; and none of you asks Me, Where are You going?
[47]  But I tell you the truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you.
[48]  The Lord s meaning was, If I do not go, I cannot be transfigured to enter into you.
[49]  Verses 26 through 28 continue, In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father concerning you, for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me and have believed that I came forth from God.
[50]  CHAPTER FOUR THE LORD S PRAYER FOR THE ONENESS
[51]  We have already mentioned that John 14, 15, and 16 are a message given to the disciples by the Lord on the night of His betrayal after His supper was established.
[52]  Then in John 17 the Lord offered a prayer to conclude the message.
[53]  Furthermore, He would resurrect from death to impart His life to us that we may live as He lives, causing us to be able to abide in Him and He in us.
[54]  John 17:2 says, Even as You have given Him authority over all flesh to give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.
[55]  We admit that this prayer of the Lord contains many great expressions.
[56]  Verse 3 continues, And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ.
[57]  This eternal life has a particular function within man, which is to cause man to know the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom God has sent.
[58]  I would like to ask you, brothers and sisters, to what does the Lord refer when He says that He glorified the Father while He was on earth, finishing the work which He gave Him to do?
[59]  Now they have come to know that all that You have given Me is from You, for the words which You gave Me I have given to them, and they received them and knew truly that I came forth from You, and they have believed that You sent Me. By now the disciples understood that the Lord came forth from God, but they still did not understand that the Lord was going back into God.
[60]  Verse 21 continues, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. How could the disciples be in Us, that is, in the Lord and the Father? It was by the Lord s giving them the Father s eternal life, by the Lord s manifesting the Father s name to them, by the Lord s making known to them the word of God, the truth of God, and their receiving it, and by the Lord s giving them the glory which God gave Him.
[61]  I cannot expound this portion verse by verse and sentence by sentence, but here I need to speak again about these four items: the eternal life, God s name, God s word, and God s glory.
[62]  The more you know God s word, understand God s word, and comprehend God s truth, the more you come out of the world and the more you are separated from the people in the world.
[63]  On the contrary, if you and I do not live in the fellowship of the divine life, have a thorough knowledge of God, and sufficiently receive the word of God; if we instead blend, mix, with the world, and if at the same time we do not live in God or in God s glory, do you think we can be one?
[64]  John 17:22 says, And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one.
[65]  The Lord was saying, Just as in You I am glorified along with Yourself, so I pray that in You they also will be glorified with You.
[66]  Just as You desire that in You I have Your nature and be with You, so I pray that in You they also will have Your nature and be with You.
[67]  Only in such a condition can all the believers be one as the Triune God is one.
[68]  What the Lord meant was that He was now in the Father and He also would like His disciples to be with Him in the Father.
[69]  His death and resurrection was to bring those who believe in Him into God that they may see the glory with which He is glorified in the Father and that they may be glorified along with Him and God.
[70]  Therefore, the Lord prayed, Father, concerning that which You have given Me, I desire that they also may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory, which You have given Me. What is this glory? This glory is to be with God and to express God, that is, to be in God.
[71]  Now they have beheld how I became the Son of Man and how I lived as a lowly man, but they do not see how I am One who is in God and how I am glorified along with God.
[72]  After John 17, chapter eighteen talks about the Lord s being betrayed and judged.
[73]  Then chapter nineteen talks about His crucifixion for the accomplishing of redemption.
[74]  In particular, it says that blood and water came out of the Lord s side v. 34 . Of the four Gospels, only John mentions blood and water.
[75]  You need to realize that the coming out of blood and water was the Lord s preparing a place for the disciples.
[76]  The last passage in the Scripture reading above, Hebrews 12:22-24, was poorly translated in the Chinese version of the Bible.
[77]  A more appropriate translation should be, But you have come forward to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem; and to myriads of angels, to the universal gathering; and to the church of the firstborn, who have been enrolled in the heavens; and to God, the Judge of all; and to the spirits of righteous men who have been made perfect; and to Jesus, the Mediator of a new covenant; and to the blood of sprinkling, which speaks something better than that of Abel.
[78]  In this message we will make a great turn.
[79]  We have just turned from the covenant of Abraham to the covenant of law, and again from the covenant of law to the new covenant, showing that the new covenant is the continuation of the covenant of Abraham.
[80]  From God s point of view, the Lord s incarnation was His coming to the earth to set up a tabernacle for Him to have a dwelling place.
[81]  When you come to chapter twenty-one, you see that it says, I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband v. 2 . Then it says that the city which came down out of heaven is the tabernacle of God with men v. 3 . So you see that the bride, the wife, of the Lamb is a city.
[82]  We now understand a little about what God wants to build.
[83]  The Bible seems to present two aspects concerning the building of God.
[84]  On the other hand, the expositors say that Hebrews 11 speaks about God s building of the holy city, and that John 14, in which the Lord said, I go and prepare a place for you, also refers to His building of the holy city.
[85]  He said that the Corinthians were God s building and that they, the apostles, were God s fellow workers who were building up the Corinthians v. 9 . He also said, If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him v. 17 . Here the temple refers to the church, not man s body.
[86]  CHAPTER SIX THE PLACE WHERE THE BELIEVERS GO A GENERAL INACCURATE BELIEF
[87]  We will begin by studying some Scriptures to help everyone to know the truth concerning the place where the believers go.
[88]  Because of this, we would like to address the inaccurate belief in Christianity concerning the matter of going to a heavenly mansion.
[89]  I believe that the brothers and sisters all know that among orthodox Christians it is universally believed that when a person who believes in the Lord and is saved dies, although his body is left on the earth, his spirit goes to a heavenly mansion, to the place where God and the Lord Jesus are.
[90]  Matthew 3:12 says, Whose winnowing fan is in His hand.
[91]  And He will thoroughly cleanse His threshing floor and will gather His wheat into His barn, but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire.
[92]  I believe that after reading these messages everyone is able to clearly see that for us the saved ones, our eternal dwelling place is not in any of the three places of the universe heaven, earth, or underneath the earth.
[93]  God wants to build Himself into man and build man into Himself.
[94]  We know that this building work of God is accomplished by His coming to be man s life.
[95]  Ephesians 4:11-13 says, And He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[96]  John 17:20-24 says, And I do not ask concerning these only, but concerning those also who believe into Me through their word, that they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. Father, concerning that which You have given Me, I desire that they also may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory, which You have given Me, for You loved Me before the foundation of the world.
[97]  Hebrews 11:16 says, But as it is, they long after a better country, that is, a heavenly one.
[98]  Revelation 21:2 says, And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
[99]  Hebrews 11 says that God has prepared a city for them; again this verse says that the city is prepared.
[100]  Verse 12 of chapter 3 says, He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.
[101]  We have pointed out to the brothers and sisters that on the one hand, we are God s crop and, on the other hand, we are God s building.
[102]  We have pointed out repeatedly that the issue of God s work throughout the ages is to gain a city, the New Jerusalem.
[103]  This is stated clearly in the writings of John.
[104]  Therefore, if you want to understand the writings of John, you cannot just read his Gospel, nor can you read only his Epistles, and in the same way you cannot read only his Revelation.
[105]  Satan wanted to destroy this temple, but the Lord raised it up through resurrection v. 19 . After that he also says that he who has the bride is the bridegroom 3:29 . The Lord, who was incarnated, who tabernacled among men, who built up the temple, is the Bridegroom.
[106]  THOSE WHO ARE MATURE AND ARE BUILT UP TODAY
[107]  However, we need to strengthen one point a little.
[108]  Although the New Jerusalem will be manifested only in the new heaven and the new earth, if you read Revelation carefully, you will see the New Jerusalem in chapter two and chapter three.
[109]  As for those who have not been fully built up by God, those who have not matured, God will edify them and build them in the millennial kingdom so that they can be matured.
