   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Turning to the Lord's Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>While studying in the seminary in Nanking, she met Sister Ruth Lee along with other sisters and also Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through her contact with them she received enlightenment concerning the denominations negatively and the church positively.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Her fellowship with them caused her later to turn to the Lord's recovery in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By doing this, she dropped her popular preaching which was highly esteemed by hundreds of Christians in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To them it was foolish to give up such a promising gospel work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To her, however, it was obedience to the heavenly vision for which she was willing to pay the price at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Near the end of 1926, she and some other sisters moved to Shanghai where they began to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Great Asset</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Following the establishment of the church in Shanghai, she became a great help among the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the same time she still did much evangelical work, preaching in schools and visiting in other cities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She was excellent not only in holding gospel meetings but also in contacting individuals for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When she stayed in Shanghai, she would visit new contacts with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Very rarely was there one to whom she had spoken not eventually saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While Ruth Lee was a great help to the sisters, Peace Wang's burden was to care for the gospel candidates.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She was a strict and frank person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of her love for the Lord, she disciplined herself very much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, she had an excellent character.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Her consecration to the Lord was more than absolute with a constant burning zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Her will was always submissive to the Lord's, her mind was constantly and instantly sober in understanding spiritual things, and her spirit was pure, strong, and always out front in contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, she reached a high point in spiritual things and had a great measure in spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By possessing all these qualities, she was equipped with a keen discernment in helping others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Her whole being was for the Lord and His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nothing preoccupied, frustrated, or distracted her from the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She was always willing to take care of others' needs at the sacrifice of her own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>She had a broadened heart to embrace the innumerable spiritually as well as physically needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, hundreds of believers, not only sisters but also brothers, received her warm, brooding care.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She possessed a prominent spirit with a loving heart, a sober mind, and a frank character.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She was always bold to point out in tenderness and humility, the weak points, shortcomings, defects, faults, and sometimes even sins of those with whom she spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Her word was strong, sometimes even sharp, but her tone was full of grace and anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Under such speaking, those to whom she ministered always received rich and appropriate help, not only in life but also in the practical matters of their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Watchman Nee treasured her assistance in these aspects very much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The valuable help she imparted to her recipients will need eternity to reveal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She was not only a great help to the church in Shanghai, but she visited the churches in other cities throughout China and the Southeast Asian countries as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Early in the year following the establishment of the church in Chefoo, she came to visit us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Her visit greatly strengthened and helped us in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1943 I was sick, and the church in Chefoo was depressed due to my long illness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She arrived in the fall of that year to visit me and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That visit brought us timely help in our trial.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On that same journey, she also visited the saints in Tsingtao and afforded them the supply they needed.</S>
