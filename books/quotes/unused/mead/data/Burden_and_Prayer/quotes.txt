[1]  BURDEN AND PRAYER Scripture Reading: Jer 33:2-3; 1 Thes 5:19 ONE
[2]  Every child of God should have some God-given burden.
[3]  If you work without a burden, you will sense that you are laboring in vain and may even be conscious of reproof as you labor.
[4]  If you feel that you should preach the gospel to someone and you stop to ask whether or not you have a burden, the opportunity will disappear while you are asking your questions.
[5]  Whether or not you have a burden will be apparent either you have a burden or you do not.
[6]  If you do not pray today, tomorrow, or the next day, you will feel bothered whenever you think about it, and the burden will become heavier and heavier because you have not done what you are supposed to do.
[7]  While it is true that the burdens we have are from God and that our burden is God s will, it is also true that our knowledge mainly governs our burdens initially.
[8]  For instance, God may call certain things to our remembrance and may ask us to pray for them, or in the middle of the night God may call us to get up and pray for a brother in a remote place.
[9]  Once you pray this way, you will feel released, and when you have released your first burden, you will be ready to receive a second burden from God.
