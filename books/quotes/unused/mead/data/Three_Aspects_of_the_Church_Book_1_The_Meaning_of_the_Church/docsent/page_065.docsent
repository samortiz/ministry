   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Recovery of the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The recovery of the temple depends upon man fellowshipping with God and letting God reign.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the desolation of the temple, God gained a few among the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among them, God gained Daniel and his three friends.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God gained them in a situation of desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From the record in Daniel we see that even in a desolate situation, in which nearly everyone worshipped idols and God seemingly was not able to do anything, God still gained a few.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even though they were in Babylon, their hearts were turned toward Jerusalem, and even though they were in front of idols, their hearts were turned toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Daniel and his three friends show that even in desolation God was still able to gain some.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their being gained by God had much to do with the later recovery of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though they were physically in Babylon and saw the idols, their hearts were contacting God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead of standing on the devil s side, they stood on God s side and were gained by God Dan 1:8; 3:16-18, 23-28; 6:10, 16-23; 9:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because God gained them, they lived before God and prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, they ushered in the fellowship represented by Ezra the priest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The temple was recovered shortly after Ezra the priest returned to Jerusalem Ezra 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While Ezra was recovering the temple, he focused on the recovery of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To fellowship with God is to let God speak.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ezra was more skilled in the law than perhaps even Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through Ezra s recovery of God s word, fellowship with God was also recovered vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>6, 10; Neh 8:8-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If, however, there was only the temple without the city, the temple would have been left unprotected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, God gained Nehemiah, the governor of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time there was no king in Judah; however, Nehemiah reigned for God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He returned from captivity to restore the city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the city was restored, the temple was protected and secured.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The recovery of the temple depends upon man being gained by God, fellowshipping with God, and being ruled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The principle behind both the destruction of the temple and the recovery of the temple is based upon the origin of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The key is man being gained by God, fellowshipping with God, and being ruled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the time of the Reformation, God gained Martin Luther, just as He had gained Daniel and his three friends, ones who clearly lived before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Reformation also recovered man s fellowship with God, as signified by the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time, however, although the temple was restored, the city was not yet recovered, because there was not much of God s ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is similar to the superficial recovery of Protestantism, a recovery that is still unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the epistle to the church in Sardis in Revelation 3, the Lord charged her to establish the things that remained and were about to die v. 2 , indicating that the recovery in Protestantism is weak and unstable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is weak and unstable because it does not have much of God s reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God has gained some in Protestantism, and they have fellowship with God; nevertheless, they do not allow God s authority to be realized among them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The things that they have recovered will not be secured until there are some who see God s authority and let God reign.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This principle is also true in regard to our individual spiritual condition, as well as that of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church, God s dwelling place, comes into being when man is gained by God, fellowships with God, and allows God to reign.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Conclusion of the Types</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the types involving the seven women and the house are related.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The position of the children of Israel before God was not only that of a woman but also a house.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament, God designated the children of Israel according to two aspects: a woman and a house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a woman, the children of Israel were God s counterpart; as a house, they were God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thus, the emphases in the ten types are first on the counterpart and then on the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is seen even more clearly in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 5:31-32 indicates that the church is God s counterpart, and 2:21-22 says that the church is the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Revelation presents the full manifestation of this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The New Jerusalem is a city, and this city is the wife of the Lamb, Christ s counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This city as God s dwelling place is the tabernacle of God with men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being a woman is a matter of life and position, and being a house, or a dwelling place, is a matter of function.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The seven women, as types of the church, emphasize the aspect of life and position; the tabernacle and the temple, as types of the church, emphasize the aspect of function.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Both aspects are for the purpose that God would obtain a dwelling place on earth, express Himself and His glory, and exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The function of the church is based upon her life and position.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Her life issues from God, and her position is that of being joined to God as one and being part of God under His authority as the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since the church has God s life and the position of belonging to God, it has functions with respect to God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The church is joined to God and allows God to dwell within it and be expressed through it so that God s will can be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Of the seven women as types of the church, Eve typifies the church being produced as well as the nature of the church, Rebekah typifies the church being chosen from the world, Asenath typifies the church being obtained by God in the world, Zipporah typifies the church in the wilderness, Ruth typifies the church being redeemed, Abigail typifies the warring church in the midst of sufferings, and the Shulammite typifies the church experiencing the resurrected Christ and enjoying rest with Christ in a condition of resurrection and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The significances of the types of the seven women, the children of Israel, the tabernacle, and the temple present a clear understanding of the church, showing where the church comes from, how the church is produced, the nature of the church, and the course of the church, including its origin and destination.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the history of the children of Israel we can see many aspects related to the types of the seven women.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For example, Rebekah was from a far country, and the children of Israel also came from a far country; Zipporah was in the wilderness, and the children of Israel were also in the wilderness; Ruth was redeemed, and the children of Israel were also redeemed; Abigail engaged in warfare, and the children of Israel also engaged in warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hence, the children of Israel connect the types of the women and the dwelling places.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The children of Israel were a woman on one hand and a city on the other; they were both a counterpart and a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The children of Israel as a type connect the two categories of Old Testament types concerning the church: a woman and a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The types in the Old Testament enable us to have a clear understanding of God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church is both God s counterpart and His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church is joined to God and is the place of God s dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Likewise, the church comes out of God and is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The consummation of the church will be the New Jerusalem as a woman to be God s counterpart and as a city to be God s dwelling place.</S>
