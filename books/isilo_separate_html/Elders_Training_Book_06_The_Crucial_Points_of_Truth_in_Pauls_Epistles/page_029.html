<h2 class="head2">The Portion of the Saints</h2>
<p>The first crucial point of the truth in Colossians is found in 1:12. This verse says, &ldquo;Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.&rdquo; &ldquo;Portion&rdquo; in this verse may also be translated into &ldquo;lot.&rdquo; Lot refers to the allotment of the good land in the Old Testament. Each of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel received an allotment of the good land. The good land as a whole is the portion of God&rsquo;s chosen people. This good land was an all-inclusive type of Christ. Today as God&rsquo;s chosen people, the saints, we all have Christ as our portion. To understand this point we must read from verse 12 to the end of this chapter. This portion of the Word describes the different aspects of this lot. First, this portion is the image of the invisible God (v. 15). Second, He is the first item, the Firstborn of all creation (v. 15). As to His divinity He is the image of the invisible God. In His humanity He is the first item of God&rsquo;s creation. He is also the Firstborn in resurrection (v. 18), the Firstborn of the new creation. He is the One in whom all the fullness of the divine Trinity dwells (v. 19). This One must have the preeminence, the first position in everything. Because He is the One who has the preeminence in all things, He redeemed and reconciled all things to God. This wonderful, all-inclusive Christ is our portion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ in Us the Hope of Glory</h2>
<p>Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; This mystery full of glory among the nations is Christ in us. Christ in us is mysterious as well as glorious. Christ is the mystery which is full of glory now. This glory will be manifested to its fullest extent when Christ returns to glorify His saints (Rom. 8:30). Hence, it is a hope, the hope of glory. Christ Himself is also this hope of glory. Today He is our life, and when He comes back we shall be manifested with Him in glory (3:4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>The first crucial point in chapter two is found in verse 2. At the end of 2:2 Paul speaks of the &ldquo;full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; The book of Ephesians is on the mystery of Christ, which is the church, the Body (Eph. 3:4). This book is on the mystery of God, which is Christ, the Head. God is a mystery, and Christ, as the embodiment of God to express Him, is the mystery of God. It is crucial that we know Christ not only as our Savior and Lord, but also as the mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Embodiment of the Fullness of the Godhead</h2>
<p>In Colossians 2:9 Paul says, &ldquo;For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; This means that Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, that the fullness of the Triune God dwells in Christ in a bodily form. Fullness refers not to the riches of God but to the overflow, the expression, of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead, but the expression of the riches of what God is. Godhead refers to deity, which is different from divinity in Romans 1:20. This strongly indicates the deity of Christ. The fact that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily means that it dwells in Him in a way that is both real and practical. This implies the physical body which Christ put on in His humanity, indicating that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ as One who has a human body. Before His incarnation, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word, but not bodily. Since He became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a bodily way, and in His glorified body (Phil. 3:21) now and forever it dwells.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Walk in Him</h2>
<p>In 2:6 and 7 Paul says, &ldquo;As therefore you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him.&rdquo; According to chapter one, the One in whom we are to walk is the portion of the saints, who according to His divinity is the image of God, and in His humanity is the Firstborn of the old creation and the Firstborn of the new creation. He is the One in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwells to have preeminence in all things. He is the One by whom all things were redeemed and reconciled to God (1:20). Furthermore, according to chapter two He is the mystery of God and the embodiment of God. In such a One we have to walk.</p>
<p>As we have received Christ, we should walk in Him. To walk is to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being. We should walk, live, and act in Christ as our portion (1:12), that we may enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived in the good land, enjoying all its rich produce.</p>
<p>By walking in Him we will be rooted and built up in Him. To walk in such a One is to be rooted in Him and to be built up in Him. To be rooted is to have downward growth, and to be built up is to have upward growth. A tree grows in two directions. The roots of the tree grow downward, and the branches grow upward. We Christians must be like a tree. Our growing up depends upon our growing down. The branches can never go up without the roots going down.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
