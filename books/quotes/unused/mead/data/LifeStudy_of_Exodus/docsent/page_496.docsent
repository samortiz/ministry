   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAYING THE HALF-SHEKEL IN EVERY MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A proper meeting, a meeting that is living, rich, and balanced, is one in which each one pays the half-shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But the situation today is that certain rich ones may put in millions of shekels, whereas most of the Christians do not pay anything at all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the situation of today s Christians, and it may also be the situation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am concerned that in the meetings the leading ones are paying too much.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the leading ones pay too much, they will kill the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the other hand, many of the saints may pay less than a half-shekel, and some may not pay anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever you come to a church meeting, you should put in your half-shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is not a great requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually you need to pay just a half-shekel, yet this half-shekel is a full payment and a complete unit, for it is ten gerahs and one bekah.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I long to see meetings where all the saints pay the half-shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Recently I have been deeply bothered by the matter of overpayment and underpayment in the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With the exception of the Lord s table meeting, in most meetings some pay too much more than a half-shekel and others pay too little less than a half shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, we cannot blame those who spiritually are under the age of twenty for not paying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A group of those who pay too much tax may function like a corporate pastor, and the rest of the attendants may be like laymen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This kind of situation bothers me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not the Lord s recovery, and this is not the census for the formation of the army.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to grow and experience Christ to the standard required by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the half-shekel must be weighed not by our own balance but by the balance in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For this reason, in verse 13 the shekel is called the shekel of the sanctuary, a shekel weighed according to God s holy standard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the least, we need to experience Christ to the extent that we have enough silver to pay our spiritual poll tax for the census, for the draft.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we all pay the half-shekel in each meeting, how strong, living, rich, uplifted, excellent, and wonderful our meetings will be.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Again I say that those who are very young in the spiritual life are not required to pay the half-shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spiritually speaking, they are children or teenagers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is normal to have such young ones among us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But all those over the age of twenty are required to pay the half-shekel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is for the formation of the army.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FIGHTING FOR GOD S MOVE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the army goes forth to fight the enemy, we do not send the toddlers, school-age children, or teenagers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, we would keep them safe and protected at home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who are twenty and upward, however, must go forth to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, every meeting is a fight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to realize that every meeting is a fight for God s move.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By now we should be clear that the propitiation silver is for the building up of God s dwelling place and also for the move of God s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, as we shall see later on, after God s dwelling place had been built, the propitiation silver served as the maintenance fee.</S>
