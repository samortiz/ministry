   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST BECOMING THE PROPITIATION SACRIFICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All of you who are involved in the spread of the gospel work should know that after we bring a person to salvation, we must help him to know Christ's redemption through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first step of redemption is to redeem us back.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second step is justification based upon this redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we are reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The meaning of reconciliation is to appease.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the New Testament Recovery Version, we used the term propitiation 1 John 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Formerly, we sinned and developed a problem with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We had violated His law.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, through our sins, Satan took the opportunity to inject his poison the sinful nature into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, we were unable to live with God in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is willing to bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But on our side, we have developed a problem with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, there is the need of propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ came to be our propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not come to appease God's wrath, for God's wrath was not greater than His love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He still loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is why He sent His Son to be our propitiation 1 John 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Propitiation is not to appease God's wrath, nor to appease our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is to appease the sins that we have committed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ has come to solve for us the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The solution of the problem of sin is His appeasing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>REIGNING IN LIFE TO SUBDUE ALL KINDS OF INSUBORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Old Testament, there was atonement, but not redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The day of atonement was on the tenth day of the seventh month each year Lev 23:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sacrifice offered was called the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In addition there were the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meal offering had neither blood nor flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Its contents were flour, oil, and frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the other four offerings, however, contained flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sin offering deals with the deep-seated sinful nature in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The trespass offering deals with our outward, sinful conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, His death was a sin offering; it dealt with our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.''</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The sin here refers to the totality of sin, including the inward sin and the outward sins the nature of sin and the acts of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Chinese theology, there are the terms original sin and personal sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Original sin refers to the sin that Adam committed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Personal sin refers to the sins that a person commits himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first half of God's salvation is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord's death solves the problem of sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He has redeemed us, purchasing us, as sinners, back.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what the Lord's death has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition to this, He has resurrected and has come to live in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The negative redemption plus the positive saving equals salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His redeeming death solves all the negative, objective problems outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the problem in our inward nature can only be solved by the Lord's coming into us as life in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His life solves the five basic problems that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, today we can reign in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we reign in life, we mainly overcome two sources.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One source is sin; the other is death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition to these sources, there are all the negative things that belong to sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>None of these things are in subordination to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Neither are they in subordination to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Romans 8 tells us that the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God, for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be v. 7 . Even if the mind is willing to submit, it cannot submit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Sin and death are rebellion in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All the negative things that belong to sin and death are also rebellion in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the situation of man before he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But now that we are saved, we can reign in this life, and everything is in subordination to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sin, death, and every negative thing that belongs to sin and death can do nothing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have subdued them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All insubordination has to be in subjection to us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is to reign in life to the subduing of all kinds of insubordination.</S>
