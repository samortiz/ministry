BUILDING THE DWELLING PLACE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Moreover, our work has a goal, an ultimate consummation, which is to build up the church. The work of the cross, the work of the Holy Spirit, Christ&rsquo;s being in us as the testimony of God to be our life supply and light of life, and our being acceptable to God are for a glorious issue, a glorious goal. This goal is the building up of the dwelling place of God. Therefore, we also need to speak about the building of the church so that God can gain a glorious dwelling place.</p>
<p>Even though we have heard many messages on building, we cannot speak about building without the altar, the laver, the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. We do not want the building to be like the tabernacle at Gibeon (Shiloh) (1 Sam. 4:3, 11; 2 Chron. 1:3-13). During the two thousand years that the church has been on the earth, she has at times been like the tabernacle at Gibeon&mdash;an empty shell. The church may have the work of the cross and the work of the gospel and yet be an empty shell. This is the case among some believers today. They do not have the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar. They lack Christ as life, and they do not have the manifestation and expression of Christ in His humanity as their life supply and light of life so that man in God and in resurrection can be acceptable to God. Many Christian groups are just congregations; they lack Christ as their content and are an empty tabernacle.</p>
<p>Other believers know Christ in a deep way, but they have not brought anyone to salvation, and they cannot be built up with others. They seem to have the presence of Christ in terms of the Ark, but they cannot be built with others. May the Lord have mercy on us and open our eyes so that our work would not miss the mark. We must never lack the knowledge of Christ when we preach the gospel or speak of the cross. We should never have the Ark, the table of the bread of the Presence, the lampstand, and the incense altar without the tabernacle. We need to bring people to salvation and to the dealings of the Holy Spirit. We also need to bring people to know Christ, experience Christ, live in Christ, receive Christ as light, and live before God in resurrection so that we will produce a testimony and have the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MUTUAL PERFECTING ACCORDING<br />
TO THE BLUEPRINT FOR THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>Our preaching of the gospel must include the dealing of the Holy Spirit and sanctification. We also need to bring the saints to know Christ, who is the God who has entered into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that man can receive the shining of the light of life. Besides these, we need to speak of the resurrection of Christ. We should live before God and be acceptable to God in the resurrected One. Furthermore, we should cause the saints to see that all this is for the building of God&rsquo;s glorious church. This is the blueprint for our work. As God&rsquo;s fellow workers, our work is building God&rsquo;s dwelling place. No matter what we do or what the extent of our work is, we must work according to this blueprint. This is the vision of our work. We must all work according to the blueprint.</p>
<p>A brother who is commissioned to preach the gospel should never do an individual gospel-preaching work. Instead of isolating himself, he should join himself to others when he preaches the gospel. His attitude should be that the more he preaches the gospel and brings people to salvation, the more the believers will have one heart toward the church and be joined together. If he has learned the lessons of fellowshipping with the Lord, being acceptable to God, and always interceding, these new believers will be the riches of the church; his work should continue. A brother who leads believers to fellowship with the Lord must guard against becoming isolated and producing an isolated sect in the church. In the past we have had this shortcoming. Our ministry is particular, but we need to have a proper attitude, and we need a spirit that is in harmony with and joined to others. If the fruit of our labor can be joined with the labor of others so that the saints who are helped are one in heart toward the church, the church will be built up.</p>
<p>A brother who is gifted in leading others to study the Scriptures should realize that these riches have been given to him by the Lord for the church. He should not neglect his service but be proper. He should also guard against forming a sect. Rather, he must be joined to others, coordinated with others, and in harmony with others in his service. This is what the apostle Paul dealt with in 1 Corinthians. He did not allow the Corinthians to be divisive. There was division among the Corinthians. Some were helped by Paul and said they were of Paul, and others were helped by Apollos and said they were of Apollos (1:12). Paul pointed out this mistake and said, &ldquo;I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth&rdquo; (3:6). Both Paul&rsquo;s planting and Apollos&rsquo;s watering were for sustaining the growth of the saints; their labor was coordinated.</p>
<p>We must not have a spirit that divides and separates. Such an attitude is fleshly (vv. 3-4). If the service of a brother produces saints who support him and listen only to him, then his service and their support are fleshly. The saints should receive the perfecting of all the brothers, just as the Corinthians should have received Paul&rsquo;s portion, Apollos&rsquo;s portion, and Peter&rsquo;s portion. We should tell those who support only us that their support is of the flesh. If one brother says this concerning the service of another brother, it will cause contention; therefore, we should say this concerning ourselves. We should never help the saints with the intention of gaining their support. Our ministering should care for the saints, help them, and cause them to receive the perfecting of all the brothers. The ministering of the many brothers should mutually perfect the saints. In the church the saints should be harmoniously coordinated and built together.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> </body></html>
