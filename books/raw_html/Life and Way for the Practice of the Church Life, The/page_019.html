<P>If you do not have this flowing within, you are a dead person; you are a false Christian, not a genuine one. If you are a genuine Christian, I am sure something within you is  flowing all the time. That is fellowship. The fellowship of life is the current of the Spirit. In 2 Corinthians 13:14 we have the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The fellowship of the Spirit is the current of the Spirit, transmitting all the fullness of God to us. This is just like the current of electricity. While it flows, it transmits all the riches of the generator to the building. The Holy Spirit is the fellowship, the transmission, transmitting all the riches of Christ, all the fullness of the Godhead in Christ, into us.</P><P>How do you take Christ as your life? You have something within flowing in you; just take care of that flowing, follow that flowing, and go along with that flowing. If you follow and go along with the inner flowing, this means that you are on the right track to experience Christ as life day by day. When the inner flowing tells you to go to Los Angeles, do not say, "I don't want to go." Instead, go along with the inner flowing and do whatever it tells you to do. To take Christ as life is to go along with the inner flowing.</P><P>Not many people know this secret of taking Christ as life. Some may know yet they are not faithful to the inner flowing. Many times something in you is flowing, yet you do not go along with the flowing. You try to be good and do good in order to make yourself Christ-like, but you would not go along with the flowing to take Christ as life. This is the problem.</P><P>If you go along with the inner flowing, you will have joy. Joy is very much related to the flowing, the fellowship. If the flowing tells you to go to Los Angeles and you go along with it, you will be full of joy. A Christian must be a person who is always joyful, but you cannot be joyful unless you go along with the inner flowing. The joy is always with the flow.</P><P>How do you know that you are taking Christ as your life? Just ask yourself, "Do I have joy?" This is something that you cannot pretend. Some brothers came to me pretending to be joyful, but in my spirit I could sense their joy was false. Joy is something from within your spirit. If you have the flow and are in the fellowship, you have joy and are joyful. If you neglect the inner flow, the inner fellowship, you lose your joy. Remember that joy is always related to fellowship.</P><P>Now let us consider the next item&#151;the light. The life was the light of men (John 1:4). In John 8:12 we have this term the light of life. The light of life is just life itself. The light within us is life, and the life within us is the light. Light is something shining, illuminating. Check your experience. Do you have something within you shining all the time? If you do, that means you are in the life. How do you know that you are taking Christ as your life? By realizing, sensing, that you have something within you not only flowing but also shining. I have no utterance to describe this inner shining, just as I have no way to describe the taste of sweetness. If you want to know what sweetness is, just take a piece of candy and taste it. Then you will know.</P><P>I believe many times you have the experience of the shining within you. That is the light of life, the life functioning as light. We know that electricity is one, but its functions are many. It gives us light, power, heat, etc. Just as there is one electricity yet many functions, there is one life yet many functions. It gives us the flow, the joy, and the light. Something within us is shining all the time. If you sense darkness within you, you should realize that you are not taking Christ as life; you are out of the experience of Christ as life. If you take Christ as life, you must have the shining within you because the life is the light, and Christ Himself is the light of life.</P>
