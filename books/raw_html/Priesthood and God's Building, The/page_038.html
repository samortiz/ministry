        <h2 class="head1">PRIESTS BRINGING FORTH<br />
THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The only people who can accomplish God&rsquo;s plan are priests. God&rsquo;s plan requires priests because the key to accomplishing God&rsquo;s plan depends on man having contact with God, fellowshipping with God, enjoying God, and allowing God to flow through him. In other words, the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s plan depends upon the mingling of God and man. Although food may be available to eat, there is still a need for people to eat the food. The purpose of food can be fulfilled only when there are people to eat the food. Similarly, God&rsquo;s eternal plan to be received by man and mingled with man can be fulfilled by priests who go before God to fellowship with Him, contact Him, and let Him flow through them in a mingled way. A priest is one who stands before God and fellowships with God. The New Testament speaks of those who genuinely live before the Lord as being those who enter into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:22; 4:16). According to the type in the Old Testament, only a high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies; not even a king could enter. In other words, those who entered into the Holy of Holies were priests.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, every believer can enter into the Holy of Holies; this means that we can be priests continually. Hebrews 4:16 says that we should come forward to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace for timely help. The throne of grace is signified by the lid of the Ark in the Holy of Holies (Exo. 25:17, 21). If we want to touch the throne of grace, we must enter into the Holy of Holies as priests. Strictly speaking, whenever we pray in a genuine way, we touch the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies, and we fulfill our priestly service.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s requirement for the believers is the same as His original desire for created man. If Adam had not fallen, man would have been a priest in the garden of Eden, serving God, drawing near to God, fellowshipping with God, and living before God. When man sinned and fell, however, God blocked the way to the tree of life. The tree of life refers to God, who desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and to be joined with man. Therefore, when sinful man was barred from contacting the tree of life, it meant that he could not contact God, draw near to God, or receive God as life.</p>
<p>The God who is in the Holy of Holies today is the tree of life that was in the garden of Eden. The high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies to see God face to face and have direct contact with God, just as Adam had the right to eat of the tree of life in Genesis 2. Before the fall, there was no separation between God and man in the garden of Eden; man could live in God&rsquo;s presence to enjoy God and even eat God as the tree of life. The Holy of Holies is like the garden of Eden in this regard. At the end of chapter 3, however, man was sent forth from the garden of Eden (vv. 23-24). In type, he was barred from the Holy of Holies and put outside the veil.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hebrews 10:19-20 says that we may enter into the Holy of Holies, because the veil that separated the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place has been split. The Lord Jesus died and shed His blood on the cross to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement related to sin. Consequently, when He died on the cross, the physical veil of the temple was split, and the way into the Holy of Holies was opened (Matt. 27:51).</p>
<p>This shows that God&rsquo;s desire for us to be priests is not an afterthought on His part; it was present within Him even before the creation of man. God&rsquo;s thought is that man would be a priest to draw near to Him, contact Him, and let Him enter into man and be mingled with man. God can enter into and mingle Himself only with priests who bear His image and represent His authority. Only priests can accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL OFFICES DEPENDING UPON THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>In its presentation of the offices in Old Testament, the priesthood, rather than the kingship and the prophethood, is first spoken of in Exodus. With regard to these three offices, the priesthood is the most prominent and the most critical. This shows the other offices that man has before God depend upon the priesthood. The kingship depends upon the priesthood, as does the prophethood. According to the Bible, the kingship is even brought in by the priesthood. For example, Moses had authority because he fellowshipped with God and lived before God. Since he fellowshipped with God, he could rule for God. Fellowshipping with God is a function of priestly service, and ruling for God is a function of kingly authority. Hence, authority comes out of fellowship. If there is no fellowship, there is no authority. This means that if there is no priesthood, there is no kingship. The kingship depends on the priesthood and is brought in by the priesthood.</p>
<p>Consider the high priest Eleazar, who represented the priesthood, and Joshua, who represented the kingship. All Joshua&rsquo;s activities were under the direction of Eleazar (Num. 27:15-21). This shows that the kingship depends upon the priesthood. Even the age of the kings was brought in by the priesthood. When Samuel anointed David, the age of the kings began, and when the condition of the kings was normal, David conducted himself like a priest, going before the Ark and being clothed with a priestly ephod.</p>
<p>During the age of the prophets, especially the prophets during the time of desolation, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah were all priests who were serving as prophets. Even the prophetess Anna served in principle as a priest in Luke 2:36-38. She was a widow who spent most of her time in the temple.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the apostles served as priests before God. They continued steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word (Acts 6:4). Their function as proper apostles came out of their prayer. They burned incense before God in prayer as priests. The apostles could serve as apostles because they were priests before God. In order for a believer to be proper, he must be a priest. If a believer does not live within the veil, spending time in the Holy of Holies to contact the Lord, it will be difficult for him to be a proper Christian. As God&rsquo;s children, we must live in the Holy of Holies. If we do not pray or draw near to God, it is almost like not being a child of God. We must be priests and live in the Holy of Holies in order to be a proper Christian.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING AS PRIESTS</h2>
<p>In order to live as priests, we have to draw near to God both individually and with other saints. We need to live in the Holy of Holies by exercising our spirit and turning to our spirit to fellowship with God. We should never think of the Holy of Holies as being merely in the heavens. Subjectively speaking, our spirit is the Holy of Holies. God dwells in our spirit; therefore, our spirit is the Holy of Holies, and when we come together to release our spirit and blend in spirit, this blended spirit is the Holy of Holies as well.</p>
<p>Matthew 18:19 speaks of two being in harmony on earth concerning any matter. We can be in harmony only when we spend sufficient time in prayer with one another so that our spirits can be released and blended as one. This harmonious, blended spirit is the Holy of Holies in which God dwells. Whenever we have such a harmonious situation, God&rsquo;s presence will be there (v. 20).</p>
<p>In order to live as a priest, we must enter into the Holy of Holies and spend time in prayer. When we live in the Holy of Holies, we will bear the image of God and represent the authority of God, and we will be blended as one in spirit and be built up as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This will accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. This is the reason that only priests can accomplish God&rsquo;s plan.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
