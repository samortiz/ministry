   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO SERVE TODAY THE WHOLE BODY SERVING The Brothers and Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Handing Themselves Over and</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Elders Making Proper Arrangements</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hong Kong is a big place; it needs a strong church to carry out the proper service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Recently I saw an Assembly of God Church preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There were not very many people in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Very close by there was a cinema packed with people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Assembly of God Church had few people in comparison with the cinema.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hong Kong does not need a strong gospel giant, but it does need a strong church to rise up to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The whole Body has to rise up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the whole church rises up to preach the gospel, I believe the number in Hong Kong would increase to two thousand in half a year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order for the whole church to rise up to serve, all the saints have to hand themselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After they have handed themselves over, they have to accept the arrangement of the leading elders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When all the building materials are ready, you can mobilize different departments to begin the building work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The elders have to make a list of everything that has been handed over, including the people, things, and work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have to make a list of personnel and match the work and personnel together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have to find a practical way to carry out every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once the work is clear, the personnel set, and the way finalized, they can proceed with the actual decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In carrying out the works, the elders have to exercise strict oversight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have to set deadlines and standards.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They have to decide how good a work needs to be and when it must be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the elders can carry out these few things, mistakes and flaws will be minimized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they do not know how to do something the first time, they should still try and look for a way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After they find the way, they will discover the law to doing that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way of the church is different from the way of the missionaries; it is the way of the whole Body serving.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all have a living physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This body works, lives, rests, and eats spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The service of the church is a Body service.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is natural and normal for it to save men and perfect them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Perhaps one day you will see the church not only as a home to nurture people but as a school to train people, a factory to produce people, and a hospital to heal people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If the brothers will spend a little more time to fellowship and pray together, there will be good arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without proper arrangements, there will be setbacks, and it will be difficult to have a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Church Being</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>a Matter of the Entire Body Serving</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Watchman Nee: I do not want to add anything to Brother Lee's speaking for fear of diluting his words.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the past all the churches tried to invite gifted co-workers to work, preach the gospel, and edify their saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But I would ask a question: What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is where everyone rises up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is not just a few people like Witness Lee, Watchman Nee, and Peace Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only when the entire Body rises up is there the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church is the Body of Christ, and everyone is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should never think that we have the church as long as we have a wooden table to conduct the Lord's table or that we have the church as long as we have a few strong members.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church involves all the material, that is, all the one-talented ones coming together to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not everyone has to be like Brother Lee before he can be a piece of material.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church is not a conglomeration of five-talented ones; it is not a corporation of two-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a Body composed mainly of one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When men like you and I come together to serve, we have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When all the one-talented ones are coordinated together, that will be a potent force.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only by serving this way will we have a strong church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You should not put your hope on better and stronger ones coming to join you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You can gospelize the place where you are with the number you have now.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In a strong church a great evangelist would be treated just like one of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Suppose there is a church with two or three hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There may not be any five-talented and two-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps all the saints are one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You may think that something is lacking, but if all these so-called "untalented" ones would coordinate together, God would have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Never think that you are too short.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A person like yourself is more than qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I believe that the age of giants is over in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Perhaps in the next generation, the so-called "giants" that we have now will disappear altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today is the end time for giants.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What God wants today is the service of the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today God forbids any member from becoming too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What He wants is a strong church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the past when I read the Bible, I had strong doubts whether Ephesians 4 would ever be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I was foolish to worry and be anxious for God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>During the past few years, I have begun to feel that it is possible to fulfill Ephesians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Today God is doing the work of recovering the Body testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The gifts that He has given are for the perfecting of the saints for the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One or two specially gifted workers no longer can fulfill the task; all the brothers and sisters can preach the gospel, heal the sick, edify the saints, and save the lost.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The church can beget, be established, be trusted upon, be revived, and rise up to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It will be built up like the New Jerusalem and be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have never been satisfied in the matter of the whole Body serving.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The church is short in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But one day something glorious will emerge.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our way is becoming more and more clear.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Of course, our troubles will be more and more numerous.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In 1939 we gathered together over thirty deacons in Shanghai and set up the deacons' office in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We began to have a structure or form for our service.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>No other place practices this yet.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At that time we found in every place one man speaking and a few serving.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In Shanghai we began to have over thirty people taking "shifts" in the deacons' office.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Later Shanghai had some problems of its own.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In 1940 the Lord continued this work in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Although I was quiet outwardly, inwardly I kept praying.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I was greatly encouraged when I saw that God worked in exactly the same way as He had spoken.</S>
