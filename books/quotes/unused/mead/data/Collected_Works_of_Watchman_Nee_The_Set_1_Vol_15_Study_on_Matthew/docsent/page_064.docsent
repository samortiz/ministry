   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 6:"And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their face and were greatly frightened."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Greatly frightened."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Who would not be afraid of God's descending?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 7:"And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, Arise, and do not be afraid."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Do not be afraid" because we are still in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 8:"And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"They saw no one except Jesus Himself alone."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The glory of the Son of Man covers everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The law, the prophecies, the voices visions , and the companions will all pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only Jesus remains.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May we have only Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 1-8 reveal the kingdom of the heavens on the holy mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>1 Christ receives glory and becomes king; 2 Moses signifies the believers who have died and resurrected 1 Cor 15:52; 1 Thes 4:13-17 ; 3 Elijah signifies the believers who will be raptured while still alive 1 Cor 15:52; 1 Thes 4:13-17 ; 4 Peter, James, and John signify the untransformed Israelites as the people in the kingdom Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>37:21-28 ; and 5 the people at the foot of the mountain signify the nations Isa 11:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From verse 1 through verse 8, we see that after a man dies, his body changes, but his form remains the same as before.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The three disciples knew Moses and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The rich man died and he recognized Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 9:"And as they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man is raised from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"Tell...to no one."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is because the Lord had already been rejected, and to draw the unbelievers by His glory was quite meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To draw people while they are touched is meaningful, but it is useless to draw the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The three disciples were all special ministers; therefore, they needed special strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 10:"And the disciples asked Him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The three asked this question because they had just seen Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They still had a fresh image and thought that the revelation on the mountain was the fulfillment of the prophecies Mal 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 11:"And He answered and said, Elijah indeed is coming and will restore all things."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Elijah indeed is coming."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to God's arrangement, if a man was willing to receive the testimony of John, he would know that John was Elijah Matt 11:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although he was not Elijah reincarnated, he had the spirit and power of Elijah Luke 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 12:"But I say to you that Elijah has already come; and they did not recognize him, but did with him the things they wished.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>So also the Son of Man is about to suffer by them."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a pity that no one received John's testimony, and they even "did with him the things they wished."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today we cannot see Elijah, because the Son of Man was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If one mistreated the forerunner, he would surely mistreat the Son of Man also.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since Elijah was rejected, the Messiah also would be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, although there was the glory on the mountain, it had to remain covered because there was no need for such testimonies in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord also said that the slave is not above his master Matt 10:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Messiah was rejected, and Elijah also was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Again He said, "He who rejects you rejects Me" Luke 10:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without the Messiah, what is the use of having an Elijah?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 13:"Then the disciples understood that He spoke to them concerning John the Baptist."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord did not mention John's name, but the disciples already knew that He meant John.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although sometimes the Bible does not mention something directly, we should understand the Lord's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verses 14-15:"And when they came to the crowd, a man came to Him, falling on his knees before Him and saying, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he has epilepsy and suffers terribly; for often he falls into the fire and often into the water."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The general subject of this section vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>14-21 is the Lord's feelings toward man's unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No other deed or achievement can reveal this kind of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"A man."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This one was a remnant and was obviously a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the son was possessed, he was thrown "into the water" and "into the fire."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Water is cold and fire is hot.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that when a demon takes possession of a person's body, he makes the person feel either cold or hot.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, the person becomes an epileptic.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are many demons of this kind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 16:"And I brought him to Your disciples, and they were not able to heal him."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The disciples thought that casting out demons was an easy thing and that they had the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since they had been with the Lord for quite a long time, they assumed that they should have this ability.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In spiritual matters one should never assume anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you do not have the real capability, you will surely fail.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The disciples wanted to try; it is no wonder that they failed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The disciples could not cure the man and were instead deceived by the demon, which signifies that the Jews will be deceived by Satan's power during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 17:"And Jesus answered and said, O unbelieving and perverted generation!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How long shall I be with you?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How long shall I bear with you?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Bring him here to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Here we can see the suffering given to the Lord through the heart of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Endurance is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The suffering of unbelief is worse than that of being scolded or beaten.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>"How long shall I be with you?"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the Lord was in the world, He had to endure all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He had no choice but to endure; therefore, He had to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because the Lord was honest, people did not like to dwell with Him; this was the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"Unbelieving" is toward the Lord, while "perverted" is toward oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>"Bring him here to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The father and the mother , the child himself, and several of the disciples did not have the solution.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord said these words to show that only He had the solution.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The child's father was comforted immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These words are truly precious and comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Why did he not go to Jesus first?</S>
