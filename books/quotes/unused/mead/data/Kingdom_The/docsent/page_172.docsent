   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MUSTARD SEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third parable is the parable of the mustard seed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Another parable He set before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; which is indeed smaller than all the seeds, but when it is grown, it is greater than the herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of heaven come and roost in its branches" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seed mentioned here is the seed of life and is signified by a small mustard herb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The mustard is something good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This signifies the proper condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The proper church should come out of the seed of life and, like the mustard plant, be good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to its nature and form, it should be small and good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this parable, however, the small mustard herb changed its form, its nature, and its condition to become a great tree in which the birds of the air could lodge.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Lord's own explanation of the first parable, the birds signify the evil one, the Devil 13:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Devil is the one who comes to snatch away the word of life from people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The bird in singular number, signifies the Devil, and the birds in plural number, signify the persons, evil spirits, and other things related to the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the evil spirits and evil persons related to the Devil come into the big tree to lodge.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is this great tree?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to church history, in A.D. 313 Constantine embraced Christianity as the national religion of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By this he opened the door to let many unregenerated people come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He both encouraged and rewarded people for becoming Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whoever was baptized received a robe and an amount of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of persecuting the church, the Roman Empire began to welcome the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From that time onward the church became a great tree; it became Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Countless evil birds, evil spirits, and evil persons came to lodge in the branches of that tree.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who can say how many evil persons and evil spirits are lodging in its branches!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are many false ones in today's Christendom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many of these are rational, philosophical people of high attainment and positions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have helped Christianity to grow out of proportion, not after its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They have caused the little mustard herb not to be after its kind but rather to become a great tree.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The little herb should produce something for eating but the great tree has simply become a lodging place for the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is exactly today's situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are so many branches which are suitable for the evil persons to lodge in. This is the outward appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
