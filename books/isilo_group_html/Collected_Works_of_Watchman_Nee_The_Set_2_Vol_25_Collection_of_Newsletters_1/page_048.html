Then some brothers read many of the publications put out by the Gospel Book Room, and they received much light. They also heard many truths in the conferences in all the localities. In the fall of 1931 they invited Brother Wang Yu T'ing to come to their locality for a week of conference. From that time onward, the brothers had more and more light of the truth. After that meeting, seven brothers rose up to be baptized (they had already been sprinkled) and at the same time began meeting to break bread as the Bible commands. (At first, they broke bread once a month. Probably the denominations here in P'ing Yang do the same.) They had not been practicing this for long when a group of brothers and sisters who really love the Lord tasted some of the flavor of the joy from heaven. But the members who had not been regenerated or who were nominal Christians felt that this type of meeting was too dry and tasteless, so some gradually left. The number in the meetings gradually decreased. For this reason, some of the outsiders criticized them, saying, "The church in Hu Shan does not have anyone coming to worship, because they left the denominations. They will close their doors soon." Praise and thank the Lord; this word will never become reality, because the Lord said, "I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut." The Lord has gradually added saved ones to them since last year. Every Lord's Day people spontaneously come to hear the gospel. Now there are thirty-six brothers and sisters who break bread together. There are between fifty and sixty people who come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet. Every Lord's Day morning they have the table and they also have another meeting for preaching the gospel. In the afternoon there is a meeting for building up. There are several people who bear the responsibility for the meetings and its affairs. They are Chou Ta Ch'in, Lin Ch'u Ch'ien, P'an Fu Ch'ing, and some others. Apart from these, there are also a few brothers who stand up in the Lord's Day meetings to testify to the truth. Please pray for those who come to hear the gospel that they will be saved soon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning and Condition<br>of the Meeting in Feng Ch'uan</H2><P>It is hard to say definitely when this meeting began. The work began three years ago. The Lord's table was established after the fall of last year. In the two or three years preceding the establishment of the table, they received the truths about the spiritual life, but they were afraid of the matter of the church. They thought that the many things in the denominations which are against the Bible should be improved, but that completely leaving the denominations might also be an error. So a few brothers rose up to do a repair work. On the one hand, they eliminated the things that were flagrantly against the Bible, and on the other hand, they paid much attention to salvation every Lord's Day. Therefore, the brothers and sisters already understood something about all the matters of salvation. However, they knew nothing about the matter of the church. Thank the Lord, those responsible brothers received the light about the church last year. They know not only that in the denominations there are a few problems that are against the Bible but also that the whole system of the denominations is basically against the Bible. Therefore, in November of last year, they established the Lord's table according to the Bible. They break bread to remember the Lord every Lord's Day. They have completely broken their relationship with the denomination that they belonged to originally. Unfortunately, there are a few brothers and sisters who are not completely in one accord. There are still a few who do not attend the table meeting. (They feel it is too solemn and terrible.) May the brothers and sisters who love the Lord pray much for this meeting. May the Lord enable them all to speak the same thing so that Satan will have no ground. There are more than fifty people who meet to break bread. There are more than one hundred who come to listen to the Word but still do not break bread. There are three brothers, Hsu Jung San, Hsu Chih Yi, and Hsu Wei San, who bear the responsibility for the work of the meeting and its affairs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Condition of the Meeting in Mo Ch'eng</H2><P>This meeting place is on a remote coast. Its back is to the mountains, and it faces the sea. The scenery is very peaceful and beautiful. There are many people in the meetings. The brothers are farmers, fishermen, or potters. Even most of the sisters work in the pottery factories as painters. They are very hungry and thirsty for today's truths. Although no one has gone to work among them, many of them go to all the conferences that we have to listen to the Word. Although they do not have much worldly knowledge, they obey whatever truths they can understand to the extent that they understand it. They know a little about the error of denominations and the characteristics which the church of God should have. Therefore, in the spring of last year, they left their former denomination and began to meet completely in the Lord's name. Most of those who were sprinkled have been baptized by immersion. There are more than sixty brothers and sisters who meet to break bread. There are also about thirty who have been saved and are waiting to be baptized. There are also more than one hundred who are not saved but come to hear the Word. Brothers Chang Ho Ling and Fang Hsing San are responsible for the work and affairs of the meeting.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_047.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_049.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 48</div><br></body></html>
