<h2 class="head3">The Thought of the Tree in the Bible</h2>
<p>In Exodus 15 the children of Israel came to Marah in the wilderness, where they could not drink the water, because it was bitter. God showed Moses a tree, and when Moses cast the tree into the waters, they became sweet (vv. 22-25). Song of Songs compares God to an apple tree (2:3). In Ezekiel 47 the flowing of the river of life issues in trees growing on the banks of the river; the fruit of the trees is for food, and their leaves are for healing (v. 12). When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He said that He is the true vine (John 15:1). Furthermore, the Bible often speaks of the cross as a tree (Acts 5:30; 10:39). First Peter 2:24 says that the Lord Jesus &ldquo;Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree.&rdquo; At the end of the Bible, in the New Jerusalem, there is the tree of life. Therefore, the tree is an important matter in the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:8-9 says that &ldquo;every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food&rdquo; was in the garden of Eden. <em>Pleasant to the sight</em> indicates that the trees were to please man; <em>good for food</em> indicates that the trees were to satisfy man. Even though there were many trees in the garden of Eden, the tree of life was in the center. If we are enlightened concerning this portion, we will realize that the tree of life is the center of the universe. As far as God&rsquo;s purpose in the universe is concerned, the earth is the center of the universe, the garden of Eden is the center of the earth, and the tree of life is the center of the garden of Eden. Of all the items in the universe, God&rsquo;s focus is on the tree of life.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to the tree of life, for only it can supply the uncreated life of God. When God put man in front of the tree of life, He wanted man to eat of the tree in order to fulfill His purpose. When the Lord Jesus came to the earth, He was the tree of life. He came to please and to satisfy man and also to give man God&rsquo;s life. Whether man lives or dies is determined by his receiving or rejecting the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Thought of the River in the Bible</h2>
<p>Verse 9 in Genesis 2 speaks of the tree of life, and verse 10 speaks of a river. The thought of a river is also a major item in the Bible. When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, a rock was cleft, and living water flowed out to quench their thirst (Exo. 17:6). Psalm 46:4 says, &ldquo;There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God.&rdquo; The living water and the river in these verses symbolize the life supply flowing out of God. In John 4 the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). In John 7 He also said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). At the end of Revelation a river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (22:1). This river issues in the life supply for man.</p>
<p>The tree is a matter of food, and it gives man life. The river is a matter of drink, and it also gives man life. Both the tree and the river, food and drink, issue in God&rsquo;s life. On the one hand, the life of God is our food, and on the other hand, the life of God is our drink. On the one hand, the life of God satisfies our hunger, and on the other hand, it quenches our thirst. When the life of God satisfies our hunger or quenches our thirst, it gives us life.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:10 says, &ldquo;A river went forth from Eden to water the garden.&rdquo; The river is for watering. Verses 5 and 6 say that &ldquo;Jehovah God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the ground, but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.&rdquo; This means that before God created man, there was no rain from heaven to water and mingle with the dust of the ground. There being no rain upon the earth to water the dust of the ground until after man was created is symbolic. The dust of the ground signifies man, and the rain from heaven signifies God&rsquo;s life. After man was created, life came down from heaven, and God could enter into man to water man, quench man&rsquo;s thirst, and flow God&rsquo;s life into man.</p>
<p><em>Eden</em> signifies God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the place where He dwells (Ezek. 28:13). The river that flowed out of Eden is a symbol of the river that flows out of God. Hence, this river signifies life flowing out of God. The garden was also man&rsquo;s dwelling place. Therefore, Genesis 2:10 reveals that the Spirit of life, the living water of life, flows out of God into man in order to water man and mingle with man.</p>
<p>The second half of Genesis 2:10 says, &ldquo;From there it divided and became four branches.&rdquo; The river signifies the one creating God, but this river divided and became four branches. While the number one signifies the creating God, the number four represents the four directions of north, south, east, and west and signifies created man. Therefore, this portion shows the living water of life flowing out of the one God into man in order to meet man&rsquo;s every need.</p>
<p>The names of the four branches of the river, the places they flowed through, and what they produced also bear a spiritual significance. The name of the first branch is Pishon (v. 11). In Hebrew <em>Pishon</em> means &ldquo;flowing free&rdquo; and implies &ldquo;freely given.&rdquo; This means that the living water of life is given freely. Anyone who thirsts can come to the waters and receive without money and without price (Isa. 55:1). He who wills can take the water of life freely (Rev. 22:17). This branch flowed around the whole land of Havilah (Gen. 2:11). <em>Havilah</em> means &ldquo;to cause to grow,&rdquo; showing that there is life wherever the water of life flows. Life can even grow in a place that cannot sustain life (Ezek. 47:9, 12). The flow of this river issued in gold (Gen. 2:11). In the Bible gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. This means that the flow of the water of life issues in man receiving God&rsquo;s nature, that is, partaking of God&rsquo;s divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). Genesis 2:12 says that bdellium and onyx stone were in this branch of the river. Bdellium is a pearl-like material produced by the resin of a tree. It typifies the produce of God the Son in His redeeming and life-releasing death and in His life-imparting resurrection. This is an issue of the flow of the water of life. Onyx is a precious stone that signifies the manifestation of God&rsquo;s glorious image (Rev. 4:3). The flow of the water of life causes man to have God&rsquo;s glorious image. Second Corinthians 3:18 confirms that we are &ldquo;being transformed into the same image from glory to glory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence, the one river in the garden of Eden describes the issue of the river of water of life flowing through man. God&rsquo;s life is given to man freely and flows into man to regenerate those who are dead so that they have God&rsquo;s life and nature to manifest His glorious image.</p>
<p>The name of the second branch is Gihon (Gen. 2:13). In Hebrew <em>Gihon</em> means &ldquo;waters bursting forth&rdquo; and implies &ldquo;overflowing.&rdquo; This speaks of the water of life overflowing and bursting forth from within man. The Lord Jesus said that the water He would give man would become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life (John 4:14). The Lord Jesus also said that rivers of living water would flow out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him (7:38). The river Gihon also &ldquo;goes around the whole land of Cush&rdquo; (Gen. 2:13). <em>Cush</em> means &ldquo;black face&rdquo; and symbolizes the unchangeable, evil nature of sinners (Jer. 13:23). This indicates that when the water of life flows into sinners, it produces God&rsquo;s glorious image in sinners (Eph. 4:22-24; Col. 3:9-10; Phil. 3:21).</p>
<p>The name of the third branch is Hiddekel (Gen. 2:14). <em>Hiddekel</em> means &ldquo;rapid,&rdquo; implying power. This means that the water of life is powerful in man. Philippians 3:10 says that Christ&rsquo;s resurrection has power. Ephesians 1:19-20 says that the surpassing greatness of God&rsquo;s power operates in His believers. This river &ldquo;goes east of Asshur&rdquo; (Gen. 2:14). Darby&rsquo;s New Translation says that this river &ldquo;flows forward toward Asshur.&rdquo; <em>Asshur</em> means &ldquo;plain,&rdquo; a place where people dwell. The Lord came so that man may have life (John 10:10). He gives living water to those who thirst (7:37). This living water flows from God to the place where man dwells.</p>
<p>The fourth branch is the Euphrates (Gen. 2:14), or Perath in Hebrew. <em>Perath</em> means &ldquo;fragrant, sweet, making fertile, fruitful.&rdquo; This means that the water of life can make man&rsquo;s life sweet, fertile, and fruitful. Paul says that the apostles manifested the savor of the knowledge of Christ (2 Cor. 2:14). This savor, or sweetness, was the flowing out of the water of life. In addition, the water of life flows all the fullness of the Godhead in Christ into us to make us full in Him (Col. 2:9-10). Second Peter 1:3-4 says that God has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness so that through these we might become partakers of His divine nature. Then Peter enumerates the fruit born of this life in verses 5 through 7. The fruit of the Spirit listed in Galatians 5:22-23 is also the issue of the flow of life.</p>
<p>The issue of the four branches of the living water of life is rich. All the fullness of the Godhead flows in this river in order to reach us. God put Adam in the garden of Eden with the tree of life and a river. The tree of life is a matter of food, and the river is a matter of drink. Both the tree and the river are matters of life. This reveals that God&rsquo;s desire and purpose for man are fulfilled through life.</p>
