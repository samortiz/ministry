   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REDEMPTIVE AND NON-REDEMPTIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ASPECTS OF CHRIST'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before man sinned, God had a goal and a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He wanted man to receive His life His uncreated life and become His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After man was created, God placed him in front of the tree of life, implicitly indicating that man should eat of the tree of life, that is, man should receive God's uncreated life into him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man did have life, but the life he had was only a created life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is uncreated, and His intention is that the created man would receive His own uncreated life and be uplifted from the level of man to one that is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This does not mean that man would become God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It only means that man would share the life of God and live by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is God's original intention.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Adam fell and failed God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God then sent His own Son to die for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this way all our sins are dealt with through the blood and the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord also shows us in His Word that there is another aspect to the death of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the non-redemptive aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all know that His death is for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But there is another aspect a non-redemptive aspect to His death, which is spoken of quite a number of times in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One great mistake that men make today is in thinking that the cross of Christ was solely for the accomplishment of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Bible shows us that there is another aspect to the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through the cross Christ released His life and dispensed it into men.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 3:21 we see a type of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God killed a lamb and gave its skin to Adam for a covering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in Genesis 2:21 there is another type of the death of Christ Adam's sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regarding Adam's sleep, the Bible does not speak of the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It only says that God took a rib from him and made Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The killing of the lamb and the covering of Adam's body with the skin refer to the redemptive aspect of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After He accomplished the work of redemption, He clothed us with the garment of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were naked before God, but the Lord died for us and put a garment of righteousness on us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All those who are in Christ and who have come to God are accepted by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They are accepted by Him in the same way that Christ is accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God receives all those who come to Him through putting on the skin of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God receives them in the same way that He received the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today every saved person comes to God by trusting in the work of the Lord's redemption and by putting on the Lord as their righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, took a rib from him, and made Eve out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Adam's sleep is a type of the non-redemptive aspect of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Out of His death God took out something to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God took life out of Christ and gave this life to man, a life which is the same as God's, divine and uncreated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know from Genesis that God created many animals, and He created Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The animals are lower than man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When God wanted to prepare a mate for Adam, He did not look among the lower animals.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, He took a rib out from Adam and made Eve, whose life, like Adam's, was different from the lower forms of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Similarly, man's life is on one level, while Christ's life is on a higher level.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God took the life of Christ and created us in a fresh way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this way we received the life of Christ to fulfill God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the church, which is built up with all the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The life of the church is the same as the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The life which we received at the time of salvation and regeneration is higher than any other form of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Originally, our life was fleshly and earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But God has given Christ's life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By this life we are built up as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Adam's sleep in Genesis 2:21 is not a type of the redemptive death of Christ, because at that time man had not yet sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without sin there was no need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The death of the lamb in Genesis 3:21 is a type of the redemptive death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The covering of skin became necessary after man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without sin there was no need and use for the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The skin signifies the coming redemptive death of Christ; it is entirely different from the sleep in Genesis 2:21.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Adam's sleep in Genesis 2:21 typifies another aspect of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not an ordinary sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a sleep that has nothing to do with death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is the kind of sleep that a saved person goes through when he departs from this world.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We no longer have to go through death, which comes as a result of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord said that those who believe in Him will have eternal life and will not see death John 6:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The death of a Christian is a sleep and has nothing to do with death or sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we want to understand the Bible and trace its outlines, we have to differentiate between the redemptive aspect and the non-redemptive aspect of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The non-redemptive aspect on the positive side brings forth Christians, who are bone of His bone and flesh of His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They are a new man created with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He spoke of the non-redemptive aspect of His death, which would give life to men and enable them to overcome the old creation to become the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Salvation brings the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When a man is forgiven, he is like a criminal who is pardoned while on death row.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This takes care of the negative need, and Christ has accomplished this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But there is the non-redemptive aspect of His death, in which He dispenses His life into us and through which we inherit a life we did not previously possess.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The death of Christ delivers us from death on the negative side and dispenses life to us on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These two aspects are absolutely different.</S>
