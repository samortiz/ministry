<h2 class="head1">THE USE OF OUR TIME</h2>
<p>When the full-timers were in the training, Monday was always a day off. However, during our time to spread the gospel, if we use this day to go on an outing, we will not get any rest, and we will be more exhausted afterwards. In the Old Testament the children of Israel kept the Sabbath. On this day they were not allowed to walk very far; hence, in Acts there is the phrase <em>a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey</em> (1:12). We must not follow the way of people in the world and go on an outing as soon as we have a day off. After going on an outing, people are generally exhausted, and they do not have the energy to go to work or school the next day. This is the wrong way to spend our day off.</p>
<p>The full-timers are busy working from Tuesday through Saturday, and they are busy meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Moreover, their pursuit is mainly corporate. Hence, they need one day every week to be calm before the Lord in personal prayer in order to contact and fellowship with the Lord. There is a genuine need for the full-timers to spend one day in personal fellowship with the Lord. In addition to this, they also have miscellaneous personal matters to take care of, for example, taking their clothes to be cleaned and buying personal items. These things should be done on Monday, on their day off. This does not mean that they cannot sit in a park or take a walk but rather that they should not go too far or exhaust themselves. A place that is close by and quiet is all that is needed to fellowship with the Lord. They can also visit their family to take care of family matters. In summary, the full-timers should not walk farther than a Sabbath day&rsquo;s journey, because this violates the principle of rest.</p>
<p>The full-timers should spend their mornings reading the Bible, studying the truth, or reading spiritual books for the pursuit of life. They should also spend some time to learn a foreign language. The more languages a servant of the Lord knows, the better. For example, if I had not labored diligently to learn English seventy years ago when I lived in China, I would be unable to deal with our present situation. The present need is for the full-timers to learn English, Spanish, and other languages. Those with a burden for Korea should learn Korean. Korea needs a group of Chinese brothers and sisters to join them in the coordination. This also applies to Japan. However, the most important languages are English and Spanish; English is the common language of the world, and there are many Spanish-speaking people in the world. In addition to this, the trainees must continue to improve their Chinese. Perhaps the Lord will use them in the future for the publication work. In any event, those who want to serve the Lord must spend time to learn languages.</p>
<p>The full-timers should use their afternoons and evenings for the work. They should use their time to go out and knock on doors if they do not have a prayer meeting or a small group meeting. They should go out five days a week in gospel teams of three saints. If one gospel team of three can gain five people in one week, the entire team of six saints can gain ten people. If the teams gain ten people in one week, they should be able to gain one hundred people in the first ten weeks. However, this number will be reduced because the full-timers will need to nourish the newly baptized believers in home meetings immediately after they are gained. They will also need to help these new ones form small groups. Hence, the full-timers will spend their time spreading the gospel through three activities: preaching the gospel by knocking on doors, nourishing the new ones in home meetings, and teaching and perfecting the new ones in small group meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING OUR BEST TO NOURISH, PERFECT, TEACH,<br />
AND CULTIVATE THE NEW BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>It is possible for the full-timers to baptize seventy or eighty people in ten weeks. The second wave of teams will spend a total of one hundred twenty days to spread the gospel. During the first seventy days, or ten weeks, the teams should emphasize knocking on doors. The teams do not need to knock on doors during the remaining fifty days. However, this is not legal. It is possible that more people will be baptized, because the new ones will bring people to be baptized. In any case, during the four months of spreading the gospel, the teams should baptize about eighty new ones either through knocking on doors or through the contacts of newly baptized saints.</p>
<p>The eighty newly baptized believers should be under our step-by-step care for one hundred twenty days. We must first nourish them and then perfect, teach, and cultivate them. The work of nourishing is accomplished through the home meetings. We need to meet with people in their homes, not in large groups. Two people should coordinate together for a home meeting. Gradually, the new ones in a home meeting will be led into a small group meeting. The small group meetings are all-inclusive, having every aspect of the church life. Therefore, as a result of being in a small group, the new ones are brought into the reality of the church life. Finally, there is the prophesying in the church meetings.</p>
<p>The teams in the second wave should baptize eighty or ninety people during the first ten weeks. The six members on a team must labor on these eighty or ninety people. We must first do a nourishing work, and then we must perfect, teach, edify, and cultivate the new ones in the small groups. After being under our care for fifty days, the new ones should be stable and should remain. In the past even though we baptized thousands of people, not many remained, because we did not nourish, teach, perfect, or cultivate them. We are now doing things differently.</p>
<p>In nourishing and perfecting the new ones in the home meetings or the small group meetings, one household can be visited in the afternoon and another in the evening. This is a minimum of two households a day. During the last seven weeks, when the teams are not knocking on doors, they must spend all their time to nourish, teach, perfect, and cultivate the new ones in home meetings and small group meetings. During these seven weeks, the full-timers can form several teams, and each team can visit at least two households a day to care for two people. Regardless of whether the full-timers are nourishing or perfecting, they can care for two people a day and ten people in five days. If the teams practice this, more than half the people under their care will remain.</p>
