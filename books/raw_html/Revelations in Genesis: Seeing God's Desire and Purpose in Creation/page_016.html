        <h2 class="head2">The Creation of Man</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:7 speaks of how God created man: &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; This verse shows that there were three steps in God&rsquo;s creation of man.</p>
<p>The first step is that God formed man from the dust of the ground. This was to create man&rsquo;s outward body. Today chemists confirm that the elements in a human body are found in the earth. The human body has salt, sulfur, phosphorus, iron, and copper, all of which are found in the earth. Hence, 1 Corinthians 15:47 speaks of Adam, the first man, who is &ldquo;out of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If man has only a body made from the dust of the ground, then man is of no value; he is no different from a sheep or a dog. However, in creating man God did something very unique, something that He did not do when He created other living things. In addition to forming man&rsquo;s body out of the dust of the earth, God breathed the breath of life into man&rsquo;s body. This is marvelous! God did not do this when He created the plants, nor did He do this when He created the animals. God did not breathe the breath of life into any living creatures apart from man. Bible readers agree that although the breath of life was not God&rsquo;s life or His Spirit, it produced life when it entered into man; this life is related to the spirit in man.</p>
<p>Man is different from all the animals because only man has a spirit. The spirit of man makes man higher than all the animals. The human spirit is the breath that God breathed into man. Although it was not God&rsquo;s life or His Spirit, the breath of life that God breathed into man is something out of God. Therefore, the Bible says that man is of God&rsquo;s race (Acts 17:28) and that Adam is &ldquo;the son of God&rdquo; (Luke 3:38).</p>
<p>When God breathed the breath of life into man, He had a wonderful intention: He created man as a vessel to express Him. He made an organ within man that enables man to love God, be drawn to God, and also contact and receive God. Everything in God&rsquo;s creation of man is meaningful. For example, because man needs to eat in order to live, God created man with a stomach, giving man the requirement, the desire, and the ability to eat. Likewise, God breathed the breath of life into man and created a spirit in man so that man would have a spiritual &ldquo;stomach.&rdquo; The Bible reveals that God is our food, our living water, and our bread of life (John 6:27, 35; 4:14; 1 Cor. 10:3-4). If we did not have a human spirit as our spiritual stomach, we would not desire God or eat Him as the bread of life. The psalmists said that they panted for God as the hart pants after the streams of water (Psa. 42:1). Dogs and cats do not desire God, because they do not have a spiritual stomach.</p>
<p>Some who think that they are clever might say, &ldquo;We are in the twentieth century. There is no need to believe in God.&rdquo; However, we have to believe in God. To avoid believing in God is the same as to avoid eating food. We need to eat because we have a stomach for eating physical food, and we need to believe because we have a spirit for receiving God. When man was created, God breathed the breath of life into man. When this breath of life entered into man, it became his human spirit. The human spirit has its preferences, desires, and requirements. The human spirit prefers, desires, and requires God. It is no wonder that regardless of whether people are civilized or barbarian, cultured or uncultured, they have the concept of worshipping God. To worship God is not a matter of being uncivilized or of being civilized; it is a matter of need. Whether people are uncivilized or civilized, they need to eat. In fact, the more civilized people are, the more they desire to eat. Hence, the more civilized people are, the more they need God.</p>
<p>Many prominent figures throughout human history said when they were young that there is no God; however, they began to seek God when they became successful and famous and had entered into their latter years. Despite the fact that they had great accomplishments and enjoyed their life, their spiritual stomach was empty. They eventually looked for something to believe in because they were looking for something to fill their spiritual stomach. The need for God was placed within man when he was created. Hence, man desires God and needs God. Moreover, man is also able to contact God because man has a special organ&mdash;the human spirit&mdash;within him.</p>
<p>For example, we cannot use a teacup to contact electricity or receive electricity. However, a light bulb with a tungsten filament, even if it is very small, can contact and receive electricity. Every human being has a &ldquo;tungsten filament&rdquo; that is able to receive electricity. As long as we contact God as the &ldquo;electricity,&rdquo; He will flow through us. We willingly and happily believe in God, because if we did not believe in God, we would be in agony inwardly. When we believe in God, we are at rest. Those who claim that they do not believe in God think that they have their eyes open, but they are actually in agony. We who believe in God are at rest, because we allow God to flow through us like electricity flows through a light bulb. The human spirit is an organ within man that was formed by the breath of life that God breathed into man. God created a human spirit in man so that man might contact and receive Him.</p>
<p>When God breathed into man, the man of dust became alive with a personality, an ego. This personality is man&rsquo;s soul. The sequence of God&rsquo;s creation of man is first man&rsquo;s body, then man&rsquo;s spirit, and lastly man&rsquo;s soul. Man is composed of three parts: a body, a soul, and a spirit. These three parts constitute a person. At this point, God&rsquo;s creation of man was complete.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
