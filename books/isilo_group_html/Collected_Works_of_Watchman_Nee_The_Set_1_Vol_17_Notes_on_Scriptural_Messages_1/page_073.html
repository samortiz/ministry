Sin is the greatest hindrance to our progress. Sin causes a runner to lose his qualification. Sin is a violation. A violator will not be allowed to run the race but will be taken out of the race.</P><P>We should put aside and reject all the known sins. Envy, pride, filthiness in the heart, lies in the mouth, impatience in our disposition, and debauchery of lusts will all disqualify us from being a runner. Disqualified runners will not be able to enter into the kingdom of heaven or to reign with the Lord Jesus. Believers must stand upon Romans 6:6 and 6:11 and must reckon themselves to be dead to sin. At the same time, we must also reject sin and not allow it to have dominion over us; we should present our members as weapons of righteousness unto God. We have to thoroughly confess, repent, and renounce all our offenses before God and seek His forgiveness. We cannot run the race set before us with an accusing conscience. We should not have any sin that has not been denied and that leaves a prolonged guilty conscience within us. If we have offended anyone, we should confess to him properly. If we owe someone any material thing, we should repay him according to our ability. We should not have any offense against anyone that has not been dealt with. Do not be afraid of losses and do not be afraid of losing face. Otherwise, we will not be able to run the race. Moreover, we have to realize that the appearance of some sins is not bad, and they easily beguile us. Moses chose "rather to be ill treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin" (Heb. 11:25). This shows us that sin has its enjoyment. Many sins make people feel happy. Man's flesh likes to sin because sin is something enjoyable. But we who have a true faith would rather suffer affliction and insult than have the enjoyment of sin. We should reject sin; otherwise, we will judge ourselves unworthy of the kingdom.</P><P>Consider again the words, "put away every encumbrance [weight]." What is a weight? A weight is not necessarily a sin nor something very bad. But it is something which easily besets us. If we do not remove the sin, we will lose our qualification in the race. However, if we do not lay aside our weight, even if we are qualified to run, we will not run fast. Have we ever seen a person running with his leather coat and his jacket on? Anything that hinders us from running fast or advancing forward is a weight.</P><P>In the nineteenth century there was a man who was greatly used by the Lord, who spent a great deal of time compiling a dictionary of Hebrew words. When it was completed, he sent it to his friends for review. His friends praised him much for his effort and considered that once this dictionary was published, he would become a well-known scholar. But, this brother eventually burned up the manuscript of the dictionary. He said, "The time of compiling [the dictionary] has decreased my love for the Lord and my love for the soul of man. Proofreading and printing will take up more time. I would rather burn it up." The proofreading and printing were not a sin, but to him they were a weight, and he chose to lay aside his weight. Although something is not sin, is it a weight to us? Will these things help us go on? Anything that frustrates our progress is a weight. Even a piece of clothing or a meal may become our weight. If we are going to run a race, and someone invites us for a bowl of noodles, or asks us to put on an overcoat, will we still be able to run the race? Therefore, we should not only remove our sin but should also lay aside every weight. If there is any weight upon us, we will never be able to run properly.</P><P>Lot failed because of the weight upon him. Lot himself was not a bad man but a righteous man who was oppressed by the licentious manner of life of the lawless (2 Pet. 2:7). But his living was different from that of Abraham. Abraham was living in the wilderness, and Lot was in the city. Abraham was living in a tent, and Lot was in a house. This was their difference-one was light and the other had a weight. Although he could run with a weight, eventually he failed because he could not run well.</P><P>We have to pay attention to what was said in Mark 4:19. The Lord did not say that we are fruitless because of sin, but "the anxieties of the age and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts for other things" cause us to bear no fruit. We do not need to sin; only a little care of the world will cause us to bear no fruit. Riches are not sin, but riches will surely not help us to fly away with two wings. Whoever intends to be a rich man will never run a good race. We have to fulfill all our God-given duties. But if our heart is entangled by anything, we will not be able to run well.</P><P>Weight is not sin; in many cases, it may even be something legal. But it is still a weight and will reduce our speed in going forward. Perhaps our weight is a friendship which we cannot give up, a position which we are pursuing, a little bit of worldly ambition, a pleasant house, a bowl of delicious food, or a beautiful dress. Although these things and thousands of other things are not sin, they will hinder us from running in a fast way.</P><P>Therefore, we should check ourselves. Is there any sin that disables us from running? What is the weight that hinders us from running in a fast way? Sin disqualifies us from being a runner and drives us out of the race. Weight causes us to run badly, even to labor in vain. What is our special sin? What is our particular weight? We have to search out these sins and weights and remove them.</P><P>Those who run the race should not only lay aside the sin which so easily entangles them and every weight but should also run the race that is set before them with endurance. Why with endurance? Because the prize is not given at the beginning of the race, nor is it given in the middle of the race. Rather, it is given at the end-the very last step-of the race. We may run well at the start, and we may even run well at the mid-point, but we will not necessarily run well at the end. A victory involves winning at the beginning, at the mid-point, and at the end. Before reaching the end, we cannot guarantee that we will win the prize. We may fail in the last five steps. Once in a two hundred meter running race, a man was ahead of the other competitors by twenty meters at first. No one expected that he would fall down just two meters before the finish line. If we want to win the race, we have to be careful. We cannot say that we will surely win the prize before reaching the end. Even Paul said, "Not that I have already obtained or am already perfected, but I pursue" (Phil. 3:12). How about us?</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 73</div><br></body></html>
