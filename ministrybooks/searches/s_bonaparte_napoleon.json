In expounding the prophecies, anyone who neglects the last of the seventy weeks will fall into error. In the past some said that Napoleon was the Antichrist. However, Napoleon was a French emperor, and in his time the nation of Israel was not yet restored. In the 1930s Panton said that Mussolini was the Antichrist, and he published the pictures of Nero and Mussolini, pointing out the resemblance between the two. Later, others said that Hitler was the Antichrist. However, Antichrist will be resuscitated after being slain, but Hitler\u2019s body was not even intact for burial after his death. Recently, there has been a great change in the Middle East situation, and some have predicted that Iraq\u2019s President Hussein will be the Antichrist.

Then in His ascension He transcended above all the names, not only the big names opposing Him and His church but also the small names. We were there among the small names opposing Him.

One is capitalism, and the other is communism. Capitalism protects private ownership; everyone can accumulate wealth for himself. Communism practices the sharing of all things in common. No one has any private possessions, and everyone gives up everything for the good of the state. The communist way appears to be similar to the Christian way, but it does not have the life of God, and it is not easy to carry out this practice. D. M. Panton wrote about democracy and socialism in one of his expositional writings. In the image in Daniel, the ten toes are made of iron and clay. Panton interpreted the iron as referring to dictatorship which will \u201cstiffen up\u201d to become fascism. The clay refers to democracy which will degenerate into communism. Therefore, clay refers to the communist party today. Since the time of Martin Luther, the Brethren have been the champions of orthodox interpretations of the image in Daniel, telling us that iron refers to dictatorship while clay refers to democracy. Prior to the Brethren, interpretations on the iron and clay focused on the incompatibility of the mixture. Other teachers emphasized their interrelatedness. For example, G. H. Lang said that dictatorship brings in democracy, while democracy in turn creates dictatorship. The clay of democracy is too weak to meet the challenges of crises, and so power goes to the hand of a few or even one person. The result is a fascist dictatorship or communist autocracy. An example of the former is Napoleon during the French [61] Revolution, and an example of the latter is the Soviet Union which evolved into communism from the instability of democracy. Mr. Panton is the first person to interpret clay to mean communism. Communism extols sharing all things in common. Karl Marx borrowed this concept from Acts. It would be a shame to Christians if one day the communists would turn around to teach Christians about sharing all things in common, selling everything, and distributing to everyone according to his need. A proper Christian does not accumulate riches for himself; rather, he forsakes everything to take the Christian confession as his primary profession.
