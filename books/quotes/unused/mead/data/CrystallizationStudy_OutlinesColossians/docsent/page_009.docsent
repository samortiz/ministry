   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Nine Experiencing Christ as Our Life Scripture Reading: Col 3:1-4 In order to experience Christ as our life, we need to see that we have one position, one life, one living, one destiny, and one glory with Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1-4; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Cor 6:17: Our position is that we are in Christ; because we are in Him, we are where He is sitting at the right hand of God Col 3:1; John 17:24; Eph 2:6: The Son s position is in the Father John 10:38; 14:10 ; we are in the Son 1 Cor 1:30a , so we are in the Father John 14:20; 1 Thes 1:1; 2 Thes 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is when we are in the spirit that we are in Christ, in the Father, and in heaven practically and experientially: There is a transmission taking place from Christ in heaven to us on earth by means of the all-inclusive Spirit in our spirit Eph 1:19, 22-23; 2:22.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven Rom 8:34 is also now in us v. 10 , that is, in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , where the dwelling place, the habitation, of God is Eph 2:22 . Since today our spirit is the place of God s habitation, it is now the gate of heaven, where Christ is the ladder that joins us to heaven and brings heaven to us v. 22; Gen 28:12-17; John 1:51.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder; our spirit is the receiving end of the divine transmission, whereas the throne of God is the transmitting end Heb 4:16.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The life of God is the life of Christ, and the life of Christ has become our life John 5:26; Col 3:4: For Christ to be our life means that He is subjective to us to the uttermost John 1:4; 14:6a; 10:10b; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:10, 6, 11.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is impossible to separate a person from the life of that person, for a person s life is the person himself; thus, to say that Christ is our life means that Christ has become us and that we have one life and living with Him John 14:6a; Phil 1:21a.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With Christ as the believers life there are three characteristics, which distinguish it from the natural life: This life is a crucified life Gal 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This life is a resurrected life John 11:25.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This life is a life hidden in God Col 3:3-4; Matt 6:1-6, 16-18.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To seek the things which are above and set our mind on them is to join ourselves to the Lord in His heavenly ministry, His divine enterprise; this is to live Christ, to have a living that is one with Christ s living Col 3:1-2: In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the High Priest to intercede for the churches Heb 8:1; 4:14; 7:25; 4:16; Col 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the heavenly Minister to supply the saints with the riches of Christ Heb 8:1-2; Eph 3:8.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His heavenly ministry, Christ today is living as the universal Administrator of God s government for the accomplishment of God s purpose Rev 4:1-2, 5; 5:6; 1:11-12: From the throne in the heavens, the divine transmission brings the things above into the local churches Eph 1:19, 22-23.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Revelation 4 and 5 we have a vision of our central government, and in Revelation 1 through 3 we have a vision of the local churches as the embassies ; through the seven Spirits what is in the heavenly headquarters is transmitted into the churches as the embassies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What takes place in the local churches should be under the direction of the throne of God in heaven; in order for the recovery to be the Lord s recovery, it must be under His direction Col 1:18; 2:19; Rev 4:2-3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our destiny is glory; Christ is leading us into glory for us to be manifested with Him in glory Heb 2:10; Col 3:4.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our life is the Christ who dwells within us, and this life is hidden with Christ in God; the Christ hidden in God is typified by the manna hidden in the golden pot vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3-4; Exo 16:32-34; Rev 2:17: Christ as the hidden manna is in God the Father as the golden pot; the Father is in Christ as the Ark with His two natures, divinity and humanity; and Christ as the indwelling Spirit lives in our regenerated spirit to be the reality of the Holy of Holies cf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John 14:16-20; 2 Tim 4:22.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we eat Christ as the hidden manna, we are incorporated into Him for the mutual abode of God and man John 15:5, 7; 8:31; 6:57, 63; 14:23.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>That Christ is our life is a strong indication that we are to take Him as life and live by Him, that we are to live Him in our daily life Col 3:4: Christ must be our life in a practical and experiential way; day by day we need to be saved in His life v. 4; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 5:10: To be saved in the divine life from the slavery of sin, the law of sin, is by the release of the law of the consummated Spirit 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To be saved in the divine life from the present age of the world is by the sanctification of the consummated Spirit 12:2a; 6:19b, 22b.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be saved in the divine life from our natural being is by the transformation of the life-giving Spirit 12:2b.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be saved in the divine life from individualism is by being built up in the Body of Christ v. 5.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be saved in the divine life from self-likeness is by the conformation of the life-imparting Spirit 8:29.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be saved in the divine life from our body of humiliation is by the transfiguration in the virtue of the divine life v. 30; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:11.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be saved in the divine life is to reign in the divine life 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be saved in the divine life will result in the victory over Satan 16:20.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The new man is the spontaneous issue of our taking Christ as our life and living Him Col 3:3-4, 10-11.</S>
