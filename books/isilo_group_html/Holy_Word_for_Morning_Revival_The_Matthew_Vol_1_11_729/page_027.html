This was the principle of the law. But in the New Testament economy, God deals with His people today...according to faith. The principle of the law has been abolished, but the commandments of the law have not been abolished....Never think...that there is no need to honor our parents or to refrain from stealing. No, instead of being abolished, the commandments of the law have been uplifted. Although our contact with God is not based upon the principle of the law, we must still observe the uplifted commandments of the law.</p><p>At this point the Seventh Day Adventists might say, &#8220;Yes, we must keep all the commandments of the law. One of these commandments is to keep the Sabbath....&#8221; Although the commandments of God have not been abolished, one of these commandments, the law about keeping the Sabbath, is not related to morality. Rather, it is a ritual law. A ritual is a form, a shadow, that we need no longer observe today. For example, we do not need to offer animal sacrifices, do we? Likewise, we no longer need to keep the Sabbath....Today is an age of reality. Our sacrifice is not a lamb or a goat; it is Christ, the reality of all the Old Testament sacrifices. In like manner, our rest is not a particular day; it also is Christ. Because Christ, the reality, is here, all the shadows are over....All of the ten commandments have been repeated and uplifted in the New Testament except the fourth commandment, the commandment to keep the Sabbath. This commandment is over because it is not related to morality.</p><p>In Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus spoke about murder and adultery. Murder refers to our temper, and adultery, to our lust....In order to live up to a moral standard higher than that of the old law, you must overcome your temper and your lusts....This is why you need Christ. This is why you need another life....We must contact Him not only day by day, but even hour by hour....We need to remain in constant fellowship with Him.</p><p>The crucial point of the Lord&#8217;s decree concerning the law is that...we must have a standard of morality much higher than the standard of the old law after we have been saved by faith....The Lord&#8217;s warning in Matthew 5 must force us to stay with Christ. We must have a daily life full of fear and trembling. We need to say, &#8220;I must stay close to the resurrected Christ. I must be one with Him....If I even lose my temper with my brother, I may be burned in the fire [v. 22].&#8221;...This thought of being burned by fire is found in both 1 Corinthians 3 and Hebrews 6....How awful it would be to pass through such a burning! Moreover, in Revelation 2:11 the Lord said, &#8220;He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death.&#8221; This word implies that the defeated Christians will be hurt by the second death, the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15).</p><p>Romans 8:4 says that when we walk according to the spirit, we spontaneously fulfill all the righteous requirements of the law. We are not trying to keep the law, for the more we try to keep it, the more we break it....Within the spirit, there is the King, Christ, who is our resurrection life. As we walk according to the spirit, we fulfill even the requirements of the highest law.
