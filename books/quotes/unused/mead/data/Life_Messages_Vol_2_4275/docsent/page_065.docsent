   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The relationship between God and man is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The common concept is that God is the Creator and man is the creature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is the Lord of the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has created all things.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whenever man is in trials and sufferings, he calls on the heavens for help.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This reaching after God is inherent in man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This view of man's relation to God may be scriptural, but it is superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A DEEPER RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What the Bible reveals as the ultimate relationship between God and us is far deeper than that of Creator and creature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The nature of this relationship is beyond human concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is that God and we may have a union in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The divine life and the human life join together to become one life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a picture of this in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I believe we are all aware that the physical things in the world are signs of spiritual realities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord Jesus again and again used common things as illustrations of spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the plant kingdom a branch which is not doing very well may be cut off the parent tree and attached to a healthier, more productive tree.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A. B. Simpson's hymn, "I am crucified with Christ," refers to this in the third stanza:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This the secret nature hideth,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Harvest grows from buried grain;</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A poor tree with better grafted,</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Richer, sweeter life doth gain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hymns, #482</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>ILLUSTRATIONS FROM ROMANS Grafting</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The thought expressed in this verse comes from Romans 11.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"You, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in and became a fellow-partaker of the root of the fatness of the olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree " vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>17, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were the poor, small, wild olive branches, grafted into the cultivated, superior olive tree, and are now enjoying the rich nourishment from the root.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The branch that is grafted is not identical to the tree to which it is attached.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they were identical, there would be no need of grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a branch from a problem tree which is grafted to a tree having some superior quality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The consequence is that the good tree subdues the inferior branch.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such is the real nature of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus as the true vine is the superior tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day by faith through grace you were grafted into Him.</S>
