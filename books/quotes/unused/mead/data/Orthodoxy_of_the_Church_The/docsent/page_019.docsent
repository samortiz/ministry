   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brothers, do you see?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Reformation did not bring the church back to the condition of the beginning; it only caused the world church to become state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thyatira is condemned for putting the church in the world; likewise, Sardis is condemned for putting the church in the states.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Reformation was living, but there were still many dead things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, many "dissenters" developed, such as the Presbyterian Church, etc. On one hand, there is the Roman Catholic Church; on the other hand, there are the Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Among the Protestant churches, aside from those established according to states, there are also churches set up according to different opinions and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The dissenters do not take the state as the boundary but their doctrine as the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, there are two kinds of churches among the Protestant churches: one is state and the other is private.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today we see the union of the state and the church in Germany, Great Britain, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rome has the world church, while Great Britain and Germany, etc., have the state church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The kings and chiefs of the states do not want to listen to the pope, yet they want others to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In politics they want to be the kings; in religion they also want to be the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, the state churches came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>People never raised the question as to what the church is like in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>People did not go back to the Bible to see whether it is proper to have state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later, the private churches came into being also.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The establishment of the private churches was due to the exalting of a certain doctrine; thus, they separated themselves from those who did not have the same doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Baptist Church was established because someone saw baptism; the Presbyterian Church was established because someone saw the presbytery system in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church was established not because someone knew what the church is; rather, the church was established according to a system.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These two kinds of Protestant churches the state and the private the Lord says, have not gone back to the purpose in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This statement is most significant.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die" v. 2 . This refers to justification by faith and the open Bible and the life that is gained from them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the whole history of Sardis, these were about to die; therefore, the Lord said, "Establish the things which remain, which were about to die."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today in the Protestant churches, the regulations of men are still in force, even though the Bible is already opened.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the Lord said, "I have found none of your works completed before My God" v. 2 . Even what they already have is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some of their things are not complete; they were not complete from the very start.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and keep it and repent" v. 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Does the history of the Protestant churches end this way?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The history of the Protestant churches is a history of revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Luther first started, many were saved, revived, and greatly recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One characteristic of the Protestant churches is "recovery."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We do not know to what extent the Holy Spirit will work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Luther reformed something; thus, the Lutheran Church came out.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The truth of the presbytery was seen; thus, the Presbyterian Church was organized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wesley appeared; therefore, the Methodist Church was established.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today in the world there are still many smaller churches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1914 there were already more than 1500 churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank the Lord, Sardis was often blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But once there was the blessing of the Lord, men organized something to contain the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although the Lord's blessing is still there, the sphere remains only that big.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Protestant churches are like a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the beginning of revival, people will go wherever there is living water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Wherever the Spirit of God is moving, people will go in that direction.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Men used a cup with the hope of preserving the living water without loss.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The advantage of doing this is that it keeps the grace, and the disadvantage is that there is just one cup of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the first generation the cup was full.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the second generation the cup was only half filled, and the nebulousness began.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By the third or fifth generation, the water was gone and only an empty cup was left.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then they began to argue with other denominations as to whose cup was better, though all the cups were worthless for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What was the result?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God reacted again, and in came another Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the whole history of revival.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the grace of God comes, men immediately set up an organization to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The organization remains, but the content is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, the cup cannot be broken; there are always those who are zealous to maintain the cup continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here is a matter of principle: The students of Wesley could never be equal to Wesley, nor could the students of Calvin match Calvin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The schools of the prophets seldom produced prophets all the great prophets were chosen by God from the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Spirit of God descends upon whomsoever He will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is the Head of the church, not we.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Men always think the living water is valuable and must be kept by organization, but it gradually declines through the generations until it completely dries up.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After it dries up, the Lord gives us living water again in the wilderness.</S>
