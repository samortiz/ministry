   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>32-46 Crucial Points</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that the section of the prophecy of the kingdom concerning the church covers two aspects: life and service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How to watch and be ready is revealed in the parable of the virgins 25:1-13 , and how to be faithful and prudent is revealed in the parable of the talents vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>14-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In watchfulness we are virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This relates to what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in faithfulness we are slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This relates to what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Virgins signify believers viewed from the aspect of life 2 Cor 11:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Believers, who are the kingdom people, are like chaste virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As virgins they bear the Lord's testimony the lamp in the dark age and are going out of the world to meet the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this they need not only the indwelling but also the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be regenerated is to have the Spirit indwelling our spirit, that is, to have the oil in our lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But to have the Spirit in our soul means that we grow in life, are transformed, and have our soul saturated with the Holy Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is to have the oil in the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, Matthew uses the word buy in 25:9, indicating that a price must be paid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having the filling of the Holy Spirit is at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not pay the price today, we will have to pay it after we are resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The man in verse 14 signifies Christ, who was going abroad, that is, into the heavens, and delivered His possessions to His slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Slaves signify believers viewed from the aspect of service 1 Cor 7:22-23; 2 Pet 1:1; James 1:1; Rom 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The talents delivered to the slaves in verse 15 are the man's possessions in verse 14.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today the Lord's possessions primarily are the gospel, the truth, the believers, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not care for these things, we will not have any talents.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, we must diligently seek the gospel and the truth, experience the truth concerning the church, and have a heart to care for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the eyes of the Lord, it is evil to bury the talent and not to multiply it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord does not care for our argument or excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He cares only that the one talent is multiplied into two, two talents are multiplied into four, and five talents are multiplied into ten.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, according to Matthew 24:45 the slave is to supply food to those in the household.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the result of our service has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first aspect is that others are fed and given rich nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second aspect is that the Lord's possessions are multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the first two sections of the Lord's prophecy of the kingdom, the Lord covered the Jews and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The third section covers the Lord's word concerning the judgment of the nations in Matthew 25:31-46.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord will sit on the throne of His glory, the throne of David Luke 1:32-33 in Jerusalem, and judge the nations not according to the law of Moses or the gospel of Christ, but according to the eternal gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a matter of God's dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who obey that gospel and treat the suffering believers well during the great tribulation will be blessed and reckoned as righteous and will inherit the kingdom Matt 25:34 , but those who do not will be cursed v. 41 and will perish for eternity.</S>
