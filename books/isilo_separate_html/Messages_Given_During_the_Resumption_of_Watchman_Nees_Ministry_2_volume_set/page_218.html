In the morning, we woke up at six o'clock. At noon we had our meal. At three o'clock in the afternoon, we had our afternoon tea. One Swiss brother from Japan was shaking his head and sighing every day. I asked why he was so unhappy. He was fifteen years older than I was, and he made tens of thousands of pounds every year. He had a few thousand workers working under him. He told me that he was having a hard time because he had not been a student for over twenty years. At the guest house where he was staying, the brother in charge was a rather uneducated person. It was very unpleasant for this Swiss brother to come under that brother's supervision. I stayed in London for eighteen months. If I had not learned submission, but instead criticized and opposed, how could I have been happy within? Submission is the nature of the Lord's life. It is for our protection to submit to God's authority.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Learning Submission in the Church</H2><P>A Christian ought to learn coordination, and coordination comes from submission. A rebellious and independent person is one who will not be coordinated. Christians ought to learn to submit one to another, and to be delivered from rebellious acts, critical words, and reviling conduct. Not only should a person have the realization of authority in the church and in the Body, but when he is alone, he should still have this realization. Today, we learn submission first in the church. It is rather difficult to learn submission outside the church. It is more natural to learn submission in the church. This is God's protection; it keeps us from exposing ourselves. If we learn the lesson this way, the spirit of antichrist will be removed from us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUBMISSION TO THE GOVERNMENT</H2><P>Concerning submission to our government, we know that no Christian can overturn any government. If certain political factors are contrary to our faith, the most we can do is to escape. It is like what the Lord says, that we escape from one city to another. In the Bible, to escape is not a shameful thing to do. If a government is not good, we can escape. But at the same time, all Christians should still pray for the governments that are not good.</P><P>One brother asked: If there are government-enacted laws which the government itself does not keep, should a Christian still keep them?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: We still have to keep them. But under certain circumstances, there are laws which a Christian cannot keep. Brother D. M. Panton said once that if a law is itself unlawful, we do not have to consider whether or not to keep that law. For example, Pharaoh ordered all the Hebrews to kill their male children. The midwives did not obey this order, yet the Bible says that God dealt well with the midwives (Exo. 1:20). Moses' mother did not obey the order of Pharaoh (Exo. 2:1-2), yet Hebrews 11 praised her faith. The reason for this is that Pharaoh's law was itself a lawless order. In the New Testament, when Peter and John disobeyed the order of the high priest, they were acting under the same principle.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_217.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_219.html">Next</a> </body></html>
