   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>G. Maintaining a Love for Men</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"But whom you forgive anything, I also forgive;...that we may not be taken advantage of by Satan" 2 Cor 2:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A heart that does not love men nor forgive men will give place to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>An unforgiving spirit opens the door to the work of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the believers were more aware of the things in the spiritual realm, they would stop being unloving and unforgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the opposition and persecution seems to come from men, but actually, every heartbreaking word, every misunderstanding, and every humiliation is motivated by the evil spirits behind the scenes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not warring against flesh and blood but against the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, no matter what comes our way, we should ask the Lord to rebuke Satan and to destroy his work.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we love others and forgive them, we will be more than conquerors.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>H. Being Particularly Careful with Our Words</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one" Matt 5:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The devil does not want man's word to be "Yes, yes" or "No, no."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He wants man's yes to appear as no and his no to appear as yes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I heard one zealous believer once say, "I do not seem to be able to control my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sometimes unconsciously, I make yes as no and no as yes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even when I make up my mind, I cannot free myself of this."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before a person believes in the Lord, his mind is blinded by the devil 2 Cor 4:4 , but after he believes, the Holy Spirit enters into his spirit and enlightens him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then gradually for no man can understand all the truth the moment he believes He removes the veils from his mind, causing such a one to submit to the Holy Spirit and to consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way, his mind is renewed and transformed Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the old man is put off, the spirit of his mind is renewed Eph 4:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, he can speak what he intends to speak; his yes will be yes, and his no will be no. Although the believers possess a wonderful life, in their minds there are always unclean thoughts and rebellious intentions against the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is due to the evil spirits, who inject evil thoughts into the believers' minds and cause them to lodge there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes, they try to confuse the believers' minds and disable their reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result, the believers do not say what they intend to say; their yes becomes a no, and their no becomes a yes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This sickness can only be removed by prayer and by the Holy Spirit taking over the whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that if anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I. Being Especially Watchful</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Contacting Others</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Looking to yourself lest you also be tempted" Gal 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is easy to lead others to the right path.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But it is difficult to lead others to the right path without deviating in one's own thoughts, words, and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many believers desire to lead others, only to find that they are being led by others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although they may be leading others, they themselves are led into others' sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the workers should carefully look everywhere for Satan's deceptions, for there is not a day when we can say that we are in a position free from danger.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>J. Always Declaring That the Enemy Is under Us</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"I have given you the authority to tread...over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you" Luke 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the enemy has is "power," but what we have is "authority."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although our individual "power" is not that great, we have received "authority" from the Lord to suppress the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not have to compete with him in "power"; we need only to give him the command with our "authority."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"Power" cannot prevail against "authority"!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we should first join ourselves to the Lord's death and secure this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should then exercise our faith to use this authority moment by moment to overcome and subdue all the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do this, we will overcome regardless of the circumstances.</S>
