[1]  CHAPTER ONE WHAT THE CHURCH IS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15-16; Eph 1:19-23
[2]  First Timothy 3:15-16 says, But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
[3]  In other words, the house spoken of here is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the mystery of godliness, which is God manifested in the flesh.
[4]  If we want to know how to administrate the church, we must spend much time in the Lord s Word to see, according to the Lord s revelation, what the church is, what the purpose of the church is, and what the function of the church is in the universe.
[5]  All who serve God in the church, all who work for the Lord, all who preach the gospel, and all who administrate the church must be brought by the Lord to such a high realm to see that the church is the pillar and base of the truth, upholding the fact of God s manifestation in the universe.
[6]  First Timothy 3:16 says, Great is the mystery of godliness.
[7]  The mystery of godliness is the mystery of God entering into man and being joined to man.
[8]  But if we have the mystery of God being manifested in the flesh and of men of flesh being joined to God, then we, as men of flesh, can be like God.
[9]  There are two portions in the New Testament that speak of the church; one is at the end of 1 Timothy 3, and the other is at the end of Ephesians 1.
[10]  In addition to these two portions, it is difficult to find another that speaks of the church in such a high and deep way.
[11]  In the preceding chapter we have seen the church from the viewpoint of 1 Timothy 3; now we need to see the church from the viewpoint of Ephesians 1.
[12]  In 1:19-22, Paul says, What is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[13]  Thus, we must clearly see that without Christ s resurrection, there would be no church; without Christ s ascension, there would be no church; without Christ s transcending of time and space, there would be no church; without Christ s overcoming all rule and authority, there would be no church.
[14]  The church is produced through Christ s ascension Eph 1:20 .
[15]  The church is not in the old creation but in the new creation of God s life; the church is not of the earth but of heaven; the church surpasses Satan; the church transcends time and space; the church is far above all things; and the church, being above all, follows Christ her Head to be the head over all things and to rule over all things.
[16]  His conclusion consists of two points: the church is the Body of Christ and the fullness of the One who fills all in all v. 23 . At this stage, the church is Christ; the church is the extension and enlargement of Christ, just as the body is the extension and the fullness of the head.
[17]  First Timothy 3 shows that the church is the house of God.
[18]  The manifestation of God in the flesh is the great mystery of godliness, which causes the church to be mingled with Christ as one.
[19]  Our actions, our management, our viewpoint, our discernment, our decisions, and our proposals all must be according to the four items of what the church is: the house of God, the pillar and base of the truth, the Body of Christ, and the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[20]  If we have truly seen that the church is the house of God, the place where God expresses Himself, we dare not and will not speak casually when we speak concerning how to manage the affairs of the church.
[21]  Question: How does the church transcend time and space, and how is it far above all things?
[22]  Our eyes need to be opened to see that when the church in Keelung is not doing well, the church in Kaohsiung also is not doing well; when the church in Keelung is strong, the church in Kaohsiung also is strong; when hall one in Taipei is rich spiritually, hall two also is rich spiritually.
[23]  OF THE CHURCH 1 THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS Scripture Reading: Eph 4:11-16
[24]  If we want to know how to administrate the church and serve in the church, we must have a thorough knowledge of this portion.
[25]  Verses 22 and 23 at the end of chapter 1 indicate that the church is produced through Christ s ascension; then chapter 4 shows that after His ascension, Christ produces, establishes, and builds up the church by giving various gifts to the church.
[26]  For the building up of the Body of Christ, the work of the gifts is not direct but indirect; it is the elders, deacons, and saints who build up the Body of Christ directly, resulting in the Body s building up of itself in love v. 16 . This portion of Ephesians, which begins with 4:11, does not end until the period at the end of verse 16.
[27]  Here it speaks of the work of the gifts on the saints; they perfect the saints until they all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.
[28]  We must firmly grasp one thing, that is, we must take the knowledge of the Son of God as the center in our service to God.
[29]  One who does not know Christ, the Son of God, can hardly lead others to know Christ, the Son of God.
[30]  If we administrate the church and handle the matters among the saints in this way, not only will Christ, the Son of God, be gone, but the spirit and life of the church will also be gone.
[31]  OF THE CHURCH 2 DISCERNING THE WINDS OF TEACHING Scripture Reading: Eph 4:12-14 THE ORDER IN EPHESIANS 4:12
[32]  Ephesians 4:11-12 shows that the service in the church is by gifts who perfect the saints so that they may carry out the ministry to build up the Body of Christ.
[33]  Their service is to bring all the saints to the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, with the result that we all arrive at a full-grown man and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13 . When we carry out the work of the ministry in our service in the church, the stature of Christ, which is Christ Himself, will increase.
[34]  Since the Son of God denotes God s life, it denotes God s nature; since Christ denotes God s work, it denotes God s plan.
[35]  Our service in the church is to lead the brothers and sisters to know the Son of God with the view that Christ will increase in them and that eventually they will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[36]  In order for the saints to know the Son of God, we must use the Son of God as the material; in order for the saints to have the increase of Christ in them, we must use Christ as the material.
[37]  Our church life must be so strong that a husband s love for his wife should enable others to see Christ, a wife s submission should enable others to see Christ, and a child s considerateness and honor toward his parents should enable others to see Christ.
[38]  Someone may ask, Why do some co-workers teach people not to wear fashionable clothing, put on lipstick, or go to the movies?
[39]  In teaching people not to do things, such as going to movies, wearing fashionable clothing, or giving a permanent wave to their hair, we must have Christ as the firm foundation.
[40]  We cannot wear fashionable clothing because Christ is in us; we cannot go to the movies because Christ is in us.
[41]  The full-grown men in Ephesians 4:13 do not listen to winds of teaching, because they are aware of this deception.
[42]  Because of their knowledge of the Son of God, they are full-grown men and have the measure of the stature of Christ.
[43]  Satan causes some to speak attractive messages in the church, and he uses these messages to carry believers away from Christ so that they will not know Christ as life, even though they have been saved for years.
[44]  A message may be scriptural, may be derived from the Bible, and may be said to be from God, but if this message does not stir us to love Christ, incline toward Christ, be filled with Christ, live in Christ, and live out Christ, then it is a wind of teaching that carries us away from Christ.
[45]  God is causing the stature of Christ to grow to its full measure in the church through the perfecting of the saints by the gifts, but Satan also has a system and scheme, and he is doing a nullifying work in the church.
[46]  Ephesians 4:12-13 reveals that God s work in the church is for man to know His Son and for the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ to increase in the church; this is God s eternal goal.
[47]  Any message that does not take Christ as the center, that does not take the Son of God as the content, that cannot bring man into Christ, and that cannot bring Christ into man is a wind of teaching.
[48]  When we listen to a message or a testimony from the brothers and sisters, we need to take Christ as the center and the Son of God as the content and check whether the message or testimony causes us to touch Christ and be filled with Christ inwardly.
[49]  Someone may be a very eloquent speaker, moving others to tears even if he does not speak of God or Christ.
[50]  We may have had several experiences in which God answered our prayers, but we still may not know Christ as life or know that God s unique work is to work in us to the point that Christ is everything in us.
[51]  When we hold to truth in love, the result will be that we grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ Eph 4:15 .
[52]  God loves us and wants to be like us; we love God and want to be like God.
[53]  Truth is God becoming man, and truth is also man becoming God.
[54]  When we grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, the result is that everything we do will come out of Christ the Head and will be Him.
[55]  OF THE CHURCH 4 THE GROWTH OF THE BODY OF CHRIST
[56]  Ephesians 4:11-13 shows that the Head, Christ, gave various gifts to the church for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[57]  Verse 13 shows that the goal, the purpose, of the service and work of the building up of the Body of Christ is that we would all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God so that we may be full grown and have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ in the church.
[58]  When we lead the saints, our purpose is for them to enter into the full knowledge of the Son of God and into the growth in life; eventually, the highest and ultimate goal is for them to have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[59]  We need to understand that the wind of teaching is not the wind of pagan religions as rendered in the Chinese Bible.
[60]  If we have truly seen that Christ is the center, no matter what we preach, we will speak from Christ and return to Christ.
[61]  Some people may be very gifted in preaching the word, but strictly speaking, the gift is not related to preaching the word itself; instead, it is a kind of talent.
[62]  If we sense that we are short of the knowledge of the Son of God, we should pray that the Lord will enable us to touch Him, to know Him as the Son of God, to minister what we have touched to the brothers and sisters, and to dispense the Son of God whom we know.
[63]  If we want our service in the church to be according to God s ordination, we must first enter into God s thought in order to see what He has ordained for the church from eternity to eternity.
[64]  With this in mind, we need to focus on the materials that God uses to build the church in addition to how He builds the church.
[65]  As we serve God, we should see not only the materials that He uses to build up the church according to His eternal intention but also see what He intends to ultimately obtain from His building work, including the nature of what He intends to obtain.
[66]  The Lord spoke of the church only after He brought His disciples to the point of showing them a transcending view of Himself as the Christ of God, the Son of God.
[67]  The Lord said, Upon this rock I will build My church, only after Peter realized that the Lord was the Christ of God, the Son of God.
[68]  In 1 Corinthians 3:9 Paul uses two illustrations to speak of the church: one is God s cultivated land, and the other is God s building, that is, the dwelling place built by God.
[69]  Now we must consider the New Jerusalem, which shows the completion of God s building work.
[70]  IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 2:13-16; Col 3:10-11; 1 Cor 12:12-13 CREATING THE TWO IN HIMSELF INTO ONE NEW MAN
[71]  If we want to clearly know what the church is and what God desires to do in the church, we need to understand Ephesians 2:13-16, Colossians 3:10-11, and 1 Corinthians 12:12-13.
[72]  CHRIST BEING ALL AND IN ALL IN THE NEW MAN
[73]  Colossians 3:11 indicates that Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, and free man are on the cross.
[74]  Christ must be produced in the church so that everyone has Christ, so that Christ increases in every member, and so that all will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[75]  Paul is a typical example of serving; we can see all of these ten points in Paul.
[76]  First, in Galatians 1:15-16 he says that he served God because it pleased God to reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles.
[77]  Question: Can you give us some instructions on the principle of administrating the church in the aspects of life and practice?
[78]  In both cases, before God we must know Christ, live in Christ, be filled with Christ, and allow Christ to occupy us.
[79]  Regarding our service to God in the church, the point of emphasis is on the kind of material we use in our service and the result of our service.
[80]  In other words, we must build the church with Christ, building Christ into man so that our inward life and nature may be exactly the same as Christ s life and nature.
[81]  Ephesians 3:16-21 says, That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith, that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[82]  Thus, his spirit and attitude what he saw, what he was filled with, what he said, and what he cared about in his heart were related to the vision of God being manifested in the flesh and being mingled with man in order to build the church with Christ so that the church would be filled with Christ.
[83]  In Paul s prayer, he asked that God would grant the Ephesian believers to be strengthened.
[84]  First, he prayed that it would be according to the riches of His glory v. 16 . What is glory? Glory is the expression of the mystery, the content within God.
[85]  The phrase may make His home in your hearts through faith means that when we first pursue God s glory for our strengthening, we may not sense that Christ dwells in us; therefore, we need to allow Christ to make His home in our hearts through faith.
[86]  Paul never neglected the need to work Christ into man.
[87]  He was worried that even though the Ephesian believers had received Christ, they did not have a deep sense of Christ dwelling in their hearts, as far as their feelings and emotions were concerned.
[88]  Hence, Paul prayed that God would grant them, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man so that Christ could make His home in their hearts through faith.
[89]  Paul s prayer is not for anything other than the glory of God to work in the believers so that they, by believing into Christ and confessing Christ, will sense Christ, love Christ, and be filled with Christ, and thus Christ would make His home in their hearts.
[90]  In our work and service of administrating the church, we should have this kind of spirit, expecting that the believers will have Christ in them and that Christ will enter into them.
[91]  This requires prayer like Paul s. In our service in the church, we should not hope that people will improve or change; we should hope only that Christ in them will become so precious, sweet, and lovely and that they will sense Christ in their hearts so that Christ may make His home in their hearts through faith.
[92]  Paul said that when we know Christ inwardly and when Christ is sensed in us, we will be rooted and grounded in His love, and we will know the breadth, which is Christ.
[93]  Paul continued in 3:19, And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, the result of which is that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[94]  When Christ has made His home in our hearts, we can apprehend His immeasurableness, and the result is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God.
[95]  Paul did not pray this way; instead, he prayed, God, grant the believers, according to the riches of Your glory, to be strengthened into their inner man, that they may know and experience Christ inwardly, that Christ may make His home in their hearts, that they may be rooted and grounded in His love, that they may see the immeasurable Christ living in them, and that they may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
