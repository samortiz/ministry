   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR WALKING IN CHRIST Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16; 2:20; 4:19; Col 1:12, 15, 18-19; 2:9, 2b, 16-17; 3:10-11, 4; 1:27; 2:6-7 THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REVEALED IN GALATIANS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians shows that Christ is versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The religion referred to in Galatians is Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before the apostle Paul was saved, when he was Saul of Tarsus, he was at the top level in the Jewish religion 1:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He thought that what he was doing was right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was zealous for God, yet he was altogether in darkness and did not see Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One day while Saul was on the way to Damascus to arrest the believers in Christ, the Lord appeared from the heavens, and Saul was caught by the Lord Acts 9:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was caught not by an outward power but by an inward revelation, for Paul said that it pleased God to reveal His Son in him Gal 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From that day Paul realized that he was crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul went on to say that he travailed so that Christ would be formed in the believers 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, Galatians reveals three major points concerning our experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First, Christ is revealed in us, second, Christ lives in us, and third, Christ is formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although these words may be familiar to us, the reality may still be unfamiliar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reality is not the words or the doctrine but the genuine experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is difficult to say what it means for Christ to live in us and be formed in us experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A doctrine is easy to learn, but the experience does not come as easily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>CHRIST REVEALED IN COLOSSIANS</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Colossians reveals that the Christ who has been revealed in us, who is now living in us, and who is being formed in us is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to Colossians 1:12, this Christ is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The King James Version renders the word portion in this verse as "inheritance."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Christ is not merely something that we will inherit in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is our present portion; we are participating in Him day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This portion is the image of the invisible God v. 15 . He is the portion to us, yet He is the image of the invisible God, and He is the embodiment of God v. 19 . Colossians 2:9 says, "In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." Christ is also the mystery of God v. 2b . God is a mystery, and this mystery is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Colossians also reveals that Christ is the body of all the shadows, the reality of every positive thing in the universe vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the positive things in the universe are merely shadows of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The light we see with our eyes is not the real light; it is a shadow of Christ as our real light John 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The food we eat every day is not the real food; it is merely a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The real food is Christ 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The air we breathe every minute is not the real air; it is a shadow of Christ 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we see someone's shadow, we know that the shadow is not the real person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The real person is the reality of the shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every positive thing is a shadow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The real feast, or holiday, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not have Christ, we have a weeping, miserable day, not a happy day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Sabbath also is a shadow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The real Sabbath, the real rest, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The real day also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is the reality of every positive thing in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Christ who is every positive thing is all and in all in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Colossians 3:10-11 says, "Put on the new man... where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The all-inclusive Christ, who is God, man, the Creator 1:16 , a creature v. 15b , the Firstborn in resurrection v. 18b , the Head of the Body, the beginning v. 18a , and every positive thing, is now our life 3:4 . If we weep, it does not mean that we have less life, and if we laugh, it does not mean that we have more life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Life is not a certain situation or condition; life is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This person, who is the all-inclusive Christ, is great, infinite, and all-inclusive, yet He is real, living, and present within us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ is our life today, and He will be our glory in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, He is our hope of glory 1:27 .</S>
