The Incarnated Christ Being<br>God's Tabernacle and God's Temple</H2><P>In the Old Testament, both God's residence in the heavens and His retreat place on Mount Zion in Jerusalem were physical. But in the New Testament, God's residence is spiritual. In the New Testament, Christ is the tabernacle of God and the temple of God (John 1:14; 2:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Church as the Enlargement of Christ<br>Being God's Enlarged Temple&#151;His Dwelling Place</H2><P>Christ has been enlarged, and the enlarged Christ is the church as God's enlarged temple. The church as the enlargement of Christ is God's enlarged temple, His dwelling place. In 1 Corinthians 3:16 Paul said that the believers corporately are the temple of God; in Ephesians 2:22 he said that we are being built together into a spiritual dwelling place of God; and in 1 Timothy 3:15 he said that the church is the house of the living God. First, God is in Christ. When we call on the name of Christ, we get God. Furthermore, God is in the church. The church, of course, is not a physical building. We believers are the church.</P><P>When we are meeting together, we are the church in practicality, and God is dwelling in and among us. Often when I am in a meeting, I do not want to be dismissed. I am happy and feel so pleasant when I am with the saints in a meeting. When we are at home and not in the meetings, we may not feel that pleasant. There is no comparison between how we feel at home and how we feel in the meetings. Some of the saints have to drive a long distance to get to the meetings. Why do they do this? They are not crazy. They do this because they want to enjoy God in the house of God, the church. God is in Christ and in the church.</P><P>Sometimes we have problems and become puzzled, not knowing what to do. We may pray in our desire to know God's will, but it seems that our prayer is to no avail. Then we may come to the church meeting, and in the meeting we receive the light, and everything becomes clear to us. This is because God is in the church.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_096.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_098.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 97</div><br></body></html>
