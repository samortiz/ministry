The City of Jerusalem Having Become a Harlot</H2><P>In 1:21-23 we see that the city of Jerusalem had become a harlot. Justice and righteousness were absent, but she was full of murderers. Her silver had become dross, and her wine diluted with water. Her rulers were rebellious and were companions of thieves, all loving bribes and chasing after rewards, and not defending the orphan nor caring for the widow's plea. This reveals that Israel had become evil in every way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. Jerusalem Stumbling and Judah Falling</H2><P>Jerusalem stumbled and Judah fell because their speech and actions were against Jehovah, to rebel against the eyes of His glory.

The distressed people cried out, and God heard them. Some of the people joined house to house and laid field to field, leaving no place for others and dwelling alone in the midst of the land (5:1-4, 7-8).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> </body></html>
