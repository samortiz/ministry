   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE TWENTY THE REMAINING SABBATH REST 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We thank the Lord for what He has been showing us about the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God could never find His full rest in heaven, because heaven is not the place where His eternal purpose is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s full rest is on earth with man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regardless of how wonderful or excellent the angels may be, God s rest is not with the angels in heaven but with man on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why the Lord Jesus taught us to pray, Thy kingdom come.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven Matt 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, the Bible reveals that God s full rest, His full Sabbath, will be on the earth with a living composition of all the redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>OF THE SABBATH REST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Beginning at Genesis 2, this matter of the Sabbath rest develops progressively.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Genesis 2 we see that God s first Sabbath was immediately after He had gained a man on earth in His image to express Him and with His authority to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Immediately after securing a man on earth in His image and with His dominion, God rested.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That was the first Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God s second Sabbath was with the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the children of Israel had gained the good land of Canaan and had built there a temple which was filled with God s shekinah glory, God had His second Sabbath on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The temple in the good land filled with God s glory signified that God had secured on earth a people to be His dwelling place, a place where He could dwell, express Himself and exercise His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This was God s second Sabbath with man on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, in the Old Testament we have two outstanding stories concerning God s Sabbath: the first in Genesis 2 and the second in 1 Kings 8.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we saw in the last message, when the Lord Jesus came, He also was God s Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Following the Lord Jesus, we have the church as the Sabbath rest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ is the Head and the church is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we come to the day of Pentecost in Acts 2, we see that the glory of God filled the temple once again, and God again secured a habitation with man on earth for His rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may say that this is the third Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God had gained a man on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although God did have something with Noah, Abraham, and with the Lord Jesus Himself, in this message we need to focus on the three main Sabbaths: the first Sabbath after the creation of man in God s image and with God s dominion; the second when the temple was built on earth and filled with God s glory; and the third when the church, as the new man, was built with people in God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first two Sabbaths, the Sabbath after the creation of man and the Sabbath after the building of the temple, both were pictures; neither of them was the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first real Sabbath that God secured with man on earth was the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is not a Sabbath rest in figure but in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Sabbaths with Adam and with the building up of the temple were types, but the building up of the church is not a type it is the fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s way is a progressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can see this in His creation in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why did not God create everything in a single day?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He could have completed everything in just a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the first day God simply called for the light, and on the second day He created the expanse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we had been there, we probably would not have been very patient, saying to God, God, the light is here, but we need air.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes we are faster than God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God s way is often contrary to ours; He always does things in a progressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day, God became a man, sowed Himself into mankind, and after the death and resurrection of that man, the church was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God did not accomplish everything once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although God has sown Himself into us as the seed, the harvest has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whatever we have received, secured, and gained today is the seed, not the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is patient.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although the seed was sown nearly two thousand years ago, God did not accomplish all the work once for all at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God sowed Himself into mankind, a wonderful age, the New Testament age, began.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before the Lord Jesus came God had never sown Himself into mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Adam and the children of Israel were types.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God never sowed Himself into the soil of Adam or into the soil of the children of Israel because they were types.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only in the church is the real soil into which God has sown Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Consider the natural law of the growth of a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you sow a seed into the ground, you do not expect to have a harvest the next morning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not even a mushroom grows that fast.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The best harvest will always take the longest time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to natural law, life takes time to grow, and the highest life requires the longest time to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A dog may grow to maturity in less than a year, but a human being needs at least eighteen years to grow into maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Parents do not expect their children to grow as quickly as a dog grows.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Nevertheless, all the pastors, preachers, and ministers are dreaming, thinking that we Christians can grow up overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need time to grow, time to ripen and mature.</S>
