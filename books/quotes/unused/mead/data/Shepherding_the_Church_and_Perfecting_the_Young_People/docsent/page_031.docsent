   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT A SPIRITUAL WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE EFFECT OF LIFE HUMAN LIFE NEEDING PROPER RECREATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Human beings are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In particular, they are limited in how much they can work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, it is God s ordination that human beings have relaxation and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This also applies to young people and their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should help young people understand that spending a great amount of time to study does not necessarily increase one s learning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether a person learns depends on whether he studies diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a young person makes a schedule of his activities, he must include some time for relaxation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Often those who regularly attend the meetings succeed in their studies because the meetings become their relaxation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In every school curriculum there is time allotted for physical education, which is a kind of relaxation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By including relaxation in his schedule, a student will be able to study effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A school cannot confine its students to a classroom, requiring them to study twenty-four hours a day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The young people must understand that spending a large amount of time studying does not necessarily mean that they will study effectively.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If the students make proper use of the meeting time, by considering it as a time of enjoyment and relaxation, their schoolwork will not be negatively affected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There have been many brothers and sisters who loved the Lord and who were also diligent students.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They were good students, and they did not let their studies affect their attending the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must help the young saints in this matter so that they do not think that in order to be good students they must spend all their time studying.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Studying until four or five o clock in the morning will not make them good students.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a schedule would make them useless the next day because, as human beings, our energy is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Human beings must work during the day and sleep at night, and we must have appropriate relaxation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A student must be focused when he studies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some students are capable, and a few are gifted, but all students must learn to focus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They should not depend on cramming in order to succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should help the young people understand that their whole being should be focused on their studies.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then at an appropriate time, they should sleep and have some physical exercise and some enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our enjoyment should not be going to movies but attending meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The meetings should be the enjoyment and relaxation of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our young people will be greatly benefited if we can help them in this way to change their concept.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>NOT FEARING DIFFICULTIES AND</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>WORKING TO ENLIVEN PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some brothers say that the work must focus on a nucleus of committed saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, a co-worker who truly knows how to work will work in a way to enliven every saint.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We must spend less time holding meetings to make decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In particular, the time for the elders meeting should be reduced, and it should be held less frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elders should spend more time working with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every elder should visit the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if we have different ways to visit the saints, as long as it is living, it is good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is no need to insist on uniformity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is important that we work until a person is enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should even let the junior high students hold their own meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A junior high brother may have many meetings in his school.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps a young person would gather five or six friends and have a meeting and then gather five or six more for another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, there may be four to five meetings in his junior high school so that many are led to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This will increase his interest and burden to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There should be no set pattern for these meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, we should not be deterred by difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Matthew 25:24 the Lord is portrayed as a hard man, reaping where he did not sow, and gathering where he did not winnow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To reap where one did not sow indicates that the environment is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no work that is without difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, we do not fear the difficult environment because the more difficult the environment, the more effective the work.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not be subdued by the environment or look at difficulties in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No matter how high a mountain is, it will be leveled.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If a surface needs to be elevated, it will be filled in, and if a road needs to be made straight, it will be straightened.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In short, nothing is too difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Every difficult situation can be conquered.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need such a spirit for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Especially those who are involved with the young people s work need such a spirit, because the young ones can be very active.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>During our first few years in the United States, we noticed that many American families brought their whole family, young and old, to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The families would all sit together in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Americans considered this to be pious.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The American mothers were strict disciplinarians and taught their children to be obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, even though many children were present, there was little noise in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Later we found out that two hours was too long for the children to sit in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This made them resentful when they became older.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As a result, we let the adults meet while some young people took care of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In other words, a children s meeting was held concurrently with the meeting for the adults.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the parents came for a meeting, they would hand their children over to the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, a child was in the hands of serving ones until he turned twelve years old.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When he started junior high school, he was encouraged to attend the meeting for the adults.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to this example, we should spend time to study our situation and find a proper way to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A difficult environment does not mean that there is no way to work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It may not be bad to focus on a nucleus, but it is not appropriate to depend on this.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we continually have elders meetings and nucleus meetings but are unable to enliven all the saints, we will achieve nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, we must put our time and energy into the service.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is sufficient to have a brief meeting when a need arises.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must try our best to put our time and energy into the work, not into meetings related to the work.</S>
