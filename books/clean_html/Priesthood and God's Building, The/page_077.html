<h2 class="head3">Being a Carpenter on the Earth</h2>
<p>This poor man out of a poor family was a carpenter on the earth. Mark 6:3 says, &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter?&rdquo; In regard to the Lord Jesus&rsquo; suffering in being a carpenter, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, we could have never imagined that You would become a carpenter. Just as a common laborer suffers and toils, You suffered and toiled.&rdquo; The Lord is certainly in glory and on the throne, but there is even more to praise Him for in regard to His being a carpenter on the earth. When the Lord created the heavens and the earth, He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood (Psa. 33:9). However, He became a lowly carpenter on the earth. Carpentry requires much time and energy. Regarding this point, there can be rich development and deep prayer in the bread-breaking meeting. Furthermore, the utterance for such prayers will be full of taste and will touch our feelings. We can pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Creator, but You willingly became a poor carpenter.&rdquo; We can continue to pray, &ldquo;Lord, You even patiently did the work of carpentry for others; thank You that Your patience is available to us today.&rdquo; As long as we grasp the content, the Spirit will surely grant us much development.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being a Man of Sorrows</h2>
<p>The Lord was a man of sorrows. He was born in a manger, grew up in Nazareth, came out of a poor family, and was a poor man and a laborer. He was truly a man of sorrows. Isaiah 53:3 says, &ldquo;He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having No Permanent Home,<br />
Traveling and Laboring Much, and<br />
Not Eating Regularly</h2>
<p>The Lord did not have a permanent home or a place where He could lay His head. Luke 9:58 says, &ldquo;The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man does not have a place where He may lay His head.&rdquo; His situation was worse than that of the foxes and birds. He traveled everywhere and often made long journeys. One time, He was wearied from the journey under the burning sun, so He sat by a well and asked someone for water. When He asked for water, the one whom He talked with was not a noble person but a Samaritan despised by the Jews, even a Samaritan woman with a bad reputation (John 4:6-7). He asked for water from a lowly person, indicating how lowly He was and how much He suffered on the earth. In order to do the work of God, the Lord was so busy that He did not have time to eat. Mark 3:20 and 6:31 both record that because He was serving diligently and faithfully, He did not have time to eat. From the time of His birth, suffering was the mark of the Lord&rsquo;s human life. He was born in a manger, grew up in Nazareth, came out of a poor family, was a poor man, worked as a carpenter, and was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. Moreover, He did not have a permanent home, He traveled and labored much, and He did not eat regularly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Following One Another in Prayer<br />
according to the Line of Thought</h2>
<p>From these points, we can see the line of the Lord&rsquo;s suffering in a simple way. When the saints are praying in a bread-breaking meeting, they can follow one another in prayer according to a line like this. Some can pray about the Lord being born in a manger, some about there being no place for Him in the inn, and some about His being the great God who came as a small infant. As we praise Him for coming down from the throne in the heavens to a lowly place on the earth, the brothers and sisters can follow one another in prayer and praising. Such prayers will be full of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Then the brothers and sisters can pray concerning the Lord&rsquo;s growing up in Nazareth, following one another, section by section. No one needs to pray for a long time. It is a beautiful scene when twenty or thirty saints pray in such a way. After every section is covered, a brother can offer a comprehensive, concluding prayer. When the meeting reaches a peak, the saints can spontaneously stand up to praise and give thanks and bless the bread and the cup. This kind of meeting will be full of enjoyment.</p>
<p>This is not something idealistic, and we are not asking new believers to immediately reach such a level. Most of us, however, have been meeting for more than a decade, and this kind of prayer is possible in our meetings; this is not an unreasonable expectation. Ten years is sufficient time for a person to finish junior high school, high school, and college. We have been meeting for ten years, but we are short of practice, so we are not up to the standard. We should not look for excuses, saying that we have already fulfilled our obligations. In these matters we are not giving the saints the proper leading. We should take these matters seriously, and we must carefully consider them, because these practices are very fine and detailed.</p>
<p>Our coordination in prayer must follow the sequence of the line of the content. For example, before the section of the Lord being born in a manger is finished, we should not jump to the section of the Lord being a carpenter. This kind of prayer is not wrong, but it is random. If a sister prays about the Lord being a carpenter, and then a brother continues by praying about the Lord being born in a manger, it is out of order. Situations such as this show that we have not been trained adequately.</p>
<p>We also need to exercise to avoid being distracted from the subject. While all the saints are praying, praising, and giving thanks according to the line of the Lord&rsquo;s suffering, someone might be touched and feel that the Lord&rsquo;s love is marvelous. He might ignore the line of suffering and veer off from the subject to pray about the Lord&rsquo;s love. We need to learn to stay on the subject, remain on the same line, and follow one another. Our prayer should not only follow the foregoing prayers but also pave the way for subsequent prayers. This can be likened to playing a ball game, in which we need to coordinate with others; we need to not only catch the ball but also make the ball easier for others to catch.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CULTIVATING AN ATMOSPHERE AND<br />
PERFECTING THE NEW ONES</h2>
<p>If ten saints are coordinating together in each district, they will be able to gradually cultivate such an atmosphere. The responsibility falls upon the leading ones. If a team is playing well, those who later join the team will quickly catch up. In our meetings the saints who are coordinating together can establish a model in every meeting, while leaving time for others to function. Some saints are just learning how to praise, but they should still be encouraged, and other saints should endeavor to bring the meeting higher. With everyone functioning, the meetings will be up to the standard and enjoyable, and the new believers will be raised up. If we all receive this kind of training, the meetings will keep and supply the saints when a district meeting is divided into two. May the Lord have mercy on us so that our meetings may be strong to keep the newly saved ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING PRAYER</h2>
<p>We need to realize that prayer related to spiritual warfare involves three parties in the universe: God, man, and Satan. In fact, the universe is just the story of these three parties. The Bible speaks of God and man, but it also speaks of Satan, who is between God and man. Our prayer should always be related to God, man, and Satan. For the most part, however, our daily prayers are focused on ourselves. We often pray, &ldquo;Lord, be gracious to me. Take care of me. I have this need and that problem. Remember me.&rdquo; Our prayers are all about &ldquo;me,&rdquo; that is, our family, our children, our spiritual condition, our sins, our weaknesses, and our problems. These prayers are not high. We need to learn to pray about God, that is, God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s purpose, God&rsquo;s work, God&rsquo;s gospel, and God&rsquo;s church. We need to pray for God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and to pray from the perspective of God. Such prayer is high prayer.</p>
