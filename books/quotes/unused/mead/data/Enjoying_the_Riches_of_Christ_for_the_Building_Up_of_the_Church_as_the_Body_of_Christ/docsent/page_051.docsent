   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE CALLING ON THE LORD IN OUR DAILY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 24; 5:7b-8; 12:13, 3b, 31; 13:1; 14:1, 5, 23-26, 31-32, 39; 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 2:14-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians may be considered the richest, most wonderful book in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It covers the Christian daily life and the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we wish to know how a Christian must live day by day, we have to come to this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, if we seek to know how the church has to meet, we have to come to this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In no other book are these two matters the Christian daily life and the church meetings more fully and adequately covered.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am afraid that many have read this book for years without seeing these two matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They have been distracted by certain points in it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we have pointed out, this book deals with eleven great problems.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason many are unable to pick up the main points when they read this book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they get into this book, they become distracted, puzzled, and even perplexed by these eleven great problems.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the secret to reading 1 Corinthians is to not care for the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With Christ and the church there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Someone may say, "I don't believe there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more I come to the church, the more problems I have."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this is so, it means that he has not yet entered into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we enter in, there are no more problems.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is only Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The cross is the biggest, most prevailing, and most effective "germicide" for our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It can kill any kind of "germ," even such a great "germ" as the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today in modern medicine there are many kinds of medicines, but we have only one kind of medicine the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we get into the church life, there are no problems because we have the cross of Christ as the antibiotic, something that is always killing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul said, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" 1 Cor 2:2 , that is, Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah, if we have the cross, what problems can we have?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we take just one "dose" of the cross, everything is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not be bothered by the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the church life there is no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE CHURCH OF GOD WHICH IS IN CORINTH</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This wonderful book starts in a wonderful way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No other book of the sixty-six books in the Bible starts in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It starts with "to the church of God" 1:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today many Christians do not pay attention to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They speak of certain kinds of churches, not the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But 1:2 speaks of the church of God which is in a locality, Corinth, like the church in Chicago, Atlanta, or Detroit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is not a church in theory, a church "in the air," but a church on this earth, and not only on this earth but in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This expression is so definite.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all must have such a church, a church of God on this earth and in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE SANCTIFIED AND CALLED SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, the persons in this church are sanctified and called, not called sinners or even called believers, but called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word saints means the holy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do you believe that you are a holy one?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the Catholic Church and even in some of the denominations, especially the Church of England, certain ones are referred to as saints, such as Saint Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we hear people refer to Saint Paul, we have to tell them that we also are a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all are called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the church everyone is a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may believe that the Corinthian believers must have been marvelous to be called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the following verses speak of divisions vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>11-12 , and chapter three speaks of jealousy and strife, saying that they were still infants and were not only fleshly but fleshy 3:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Still, they were called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise the Lord, we are the called saints!</S>
