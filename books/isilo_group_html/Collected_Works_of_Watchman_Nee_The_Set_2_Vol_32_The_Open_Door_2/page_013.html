I do not know how your visit has affected others, but it has affected me very much. Since your coming, I feel all the more weak in myself. I have become fearful of what I was hitherto not fearful of, and I can no longer do what I thought I was able to do. Thank the Lord that whenever I am weak, He becomes strong. I boast in my weakness so that His power can overshadow me. On the morning of May 15, in a little river outside the village off from Dung-Men, nine sisters were baptized. Their testimonies were wonderful; the Lord alone has done this work. May He gain all the glory. My future has been announced by the Institute. The Lord has His will and His work in sending me here to Szechuan. I no longer dare to follow my own choice. I will go wherever He leads me, and I will take His way whatever the cost may be. I need your prayer so that I can render Him some joy in this end time. Vacation for the Institute begins in June, and at the latest in the middle of July, I will leave Ch'eng-tu to go to Chung-Ching-Jou. I will stay for a month and see how the Lord leads. My classmates, Lo Chung-sien, Dai Tsi-shun, Liu Ah-shu, Wang Tsi-gui, Hu Li-zhun, etc., send their greetings to you.</p><p>A small sister in the Lord,<br />Lu Tsi-tsien, May 21</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Recently I have been busy with the work in the Bureau. Most of my time is spent carrying out inspections outside the county. But thank the Lord that everything has been under His blessing. From July 1-10 there will be a Summer Bible School with Rev. Chen Chung-kwei, Rev. Tsia Yu-ming, Rev. Lin Jing-kang, and Rev. Tien Jing-hwa conducting the meetings. The location will be the Fang-Jeng Road High School. Please pray for this meeting.</p><p>Brother in the Lord, Chao Rue-tze, June 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Among all of God's children we have received more grace than others. Yet in His house, our response has been the opposite. How unfaithful we have been! May God deliver us from all slothfulness, vanity, and lack of care for others. We have four meetings a week. On Tuesday evening we preach the gospel at Brother Tien Bi-shen's house, which is mostly attended by men from the Anti-smoking Bureau. On Thursday evening we have a prayer meeting. For the sake of convenience, this meeting is held at Mrs. Shen's house in Nan-Tai and at Brother Tsao's house in Che-Ji-Shi. On Saturday evening a Bible study is held in Nan-Tai, while the bread-breaking meeting on the Lord's Day is held in Tze-Ji-Shi. Brother Chang Man-shih has passed through on his way to Jia-Ding to assume his post with the Anti-smoking Bureau. God has used our brothers who are employed by the Anti-smoking Bureau to do some work.</p><p>Brothers Wang Yung-gui and Ji Tsung-yu</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>On the Lord's Day, the sisters from West China University had a fellowship meeting at five o'clock in the morning. They studied the Word, sang, and prayed together. It was a sweet time.</p><p>Sister Chao Shu-yueh, June 6</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
