   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The work of the elders is to oversee.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means to inspect and supervise things from a height.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the brothers and sisters are working, and these ones are observing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No one can escape their eyesight.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They know as soon as someone moves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They know who is loving the world, who is naughty, and who is in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They know who is not honest and greedy for material things, but their job is not just to look, but to help those who err.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As soon as a brother gets into trouble, the elders have to adjust him and render him help immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Moreover, in the church, every brother and sister should be serving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Every member should exercise his function.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elders should not replace others' work while they are exercising the overseership; they should only oversee them in their work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They must not be the only ones who are occupied but must make many other brothers and sisters busy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Good overseers must know how to initiate and must know how to bring all the brothers and sisters into the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have to remember that they are overseers; they are not replacement workers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have to work with the brothers and sisters, not work for them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>An elder must devote his time to his work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a hundred brothers and sisters are working and one among them is an elder, he has to devote his time to oversee the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has to ensure that they are indeed working and that no one is standing idle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has to be like the master of the vineyard who stands at the gate to observe everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He has to make sure that no one is lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has to equip everyone to serve, whether in physical chores or in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everyone needs to see that he cannot be idle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If everyone does this, the gospel will spread in a prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>ALL THE ONE-TALENTED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>HANDING THEMSELVES OVER TO SERVE THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we label one brother as useless and another sister as unsuitable, sooner or later all the brothers and sisters will become useless and only we will be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to perfect others to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to make the useless ones useful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is the Body of Christ, and all the brothers and sisters are members of this Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot call anyone useless.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord does give some five-talented ones to the church, but we must remember that the church is not built upon five-talented gifts or two-talented gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The chief factor in the building up of the church is the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are not too many five-talented ones in the church; perhaps, we can only find one in a few centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are also very few two-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It would be hard for the church to be built up with five-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the past we paid too much attention to the five- and two-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As a result, all the one- talented ones were buried.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The way of the church today is to have all the one-talented ones dig up their one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today we are not afraid that the Lord would only give one-talented members to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can ask Him to give us more of these members.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as we all dig up our one talent, the church will have a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today it is hard to find a five-talented one, but five of the least gifted ones will add up to five talents.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is not short of men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The service of the church is manifested when all the one- talented ones are mobilized, when the whole Body rises up to preach and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thank the Lord that His Word tells us clearly that no saved person has less than a talent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all have at least one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Luke 19 says that we all have at least a mina.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Matthew 25 says that we all have at least one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everyone who serves the Lord has at least one talent of gift.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No one has less than a mina; no one has less than one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can only excuse ourselves by saying that we have not offered up our one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot tell the Lord that we do not have one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even the slave who was judged evil and slothful handed one talent back to the Lord, not half a talent.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>An elder does not replace the brothers and sisters with his greater gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His function lies in bringing out the one talent that lies within all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No matter how capable and gifted an elder is, his contribution can never match the functioning of the one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is wrong for two or three highly gifted elders to do the work of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The result would be much better if these two or three elders stepped aside and the whole church stepped in to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord has given every saved person at least one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we say that we have received less than a talent, then we must not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since we have a talent, we should serve in the capacity of a one-talented member.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the reason the elders must exercise overseership.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They must not allow anyone to bury his one talent in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When I come to Hong Kong again and see people burying their talent, I will not rebuke them; I will rebuke the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether or not a church can go on depends on whether all the one-talented ones are mobilized.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am shouting here: All the one-talented ones have to be mobilized!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No power on earth can withstand the force of all the one-talented ones rising up together.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>No matter how "useless" a person seems to be, every person has to be used.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to use everyone, unless we have the thought that some members in Christ's Body are lame.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One characteristic of Brother Witness is that he can use a person, no matter how "useless" they think they are.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If they do not know how to do certain things, he will take them by the hand and teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Every smart and gifted person likes to do things by himself, but this requires him to pay a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If one is truly wise, he should stir up the one- talented ones to dig up their talent from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He has to make everyone busy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The elders should be very sensitive in their spirit; they should be able to detect buried talents and should encourage them to be dug out.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the responsible brothers do not know whether a brother or sister has hidden his or her talent, they must bear the blame.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May the Lord bless the church so that it would see what it really is.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The church is built upon one-talented ones.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We do not have to stir up five- and two-talented ones; they rise up by themselves; they do not want to hide their talents.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only the one-talented ones have a danger of hiding their talents.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In order for the church to be built up, the one-talented ones have to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No matter how much we have and what kind of persons we are, we have to dig out our talent.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When all the one-talented ones rise up, the church will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once the church is manifested, the gates of Hades will not overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The gospel will spread throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we all pour out our lives, Satan will tremble.</S>
