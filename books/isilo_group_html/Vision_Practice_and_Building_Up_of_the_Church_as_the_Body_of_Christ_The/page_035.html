FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Grieving the Holy Spirit by Corrupt Speaking</h2>
<p>Verse 30 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.&rdquo; In his writings the apostle Paul was very careful in using words and terms. This verse speaks of the Holy Spirit of God. It seems that there is no need to use the word <em>Holy;</em> we may simply say, &ldquo;the Spirit of God.&rdquo; However, holiness is the very nature of God, which relates to the previous verse. Verse 29 begins, &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth.&rdquo; Different versions translate <em>corrupt</em> in various ways. <em>Corrupt</em> may mean &ldquo;rotten, unwholesome, filthy, foul, polluted, or unhealthy.&rdquo; The Greek word has all these meanings. We must not let this kind of word proceed out of our mouth. This kind of communication is not holy; it has not been separated and does not fit the holy nature of God. Today the Spirit of God within us is the very Holy Spirit. If we speak in a corrupt way, we will grieve the Holy Spirit. According to these verses, to grieve the Holy Spirit has much to do with our speaking. Verse 29 tells us not to speak in that way, and the following verse tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit. If we speak unhealthy, unwholesome words, we will grieve the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking according to the Present Need<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>The rest of verse 29 says, &ldquo;But only that which is good for building up, according to the need, that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; Conybeare&rsquo;s translation of this verse reads, &ldquo;From your mouth let no filthy word come forth, but such as may build up the Church according to its need, and give a blessing to the hearers.&rdquo; According to Conybeare&rsquo;s realization, building up refers to the building up of the church. His footnote for the phrase <em>build up</em> says, &ldquo;Literally, <em>such as is good for needful building up</em> (&lsquo;building&rsquo; always implies &lsquo;the Church&rsquo; or something equivalent), <em>that it may give a blessing to the hearers.&rdquo;</em> Conybeare&rsquo;s understanding is correct. What was in the mind of the apostle was the building up of the church. Colossians 4:6 says, &ldquo;Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.&rdquo; We need to speak words that minister grace to others. This kind of speech has very much to do with the building up of the church, the Body. We need to speak in a way that takes care of the building up of the church.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:29 says that our speaking should be &ldquo;according to the need.&rdquo; <em>Need</em> may also be translated as <em>occasion,</em> or <em>the need of the moment.</em> Whenever we speak with the brothers and sisters in the church, we must take care of the present situation of the church. We must speak in a way to meet the need of the occasion for the building up of the church. We may illustrate this in the following way. If a brother comes to talk with us, we may realize that he has a certain problem with the church, the sisters, the elders, or the young people. This is his present situation, which has much to do with the building up of the church. At this point we are put on the spot. Our proper response depends on how we speak with him. There is the need to speak something to him to meet the present situation for the building up of the church. We may talk to him in a negative way, saying, &ldquo;I agree with you. I am also unhappy with the sisters.&rdquo; This is sufficient to &ldquo;tear down the wall&rdquo; in the church. At the least, this brother will be torn down. However, if we are in the spirit and under the control of the spirit, our spirit will have the anointing and the wisdom to speak with him. We will speak in a proper way to meet the need of this occasion for the building up of the church. After our talk, this brother will be more built in and built up into the church.</p>
<p>There are two possibilities for our speaking. One is to tear down, and the other is to build up. The proper meaning of verse 29 is that we must always speak in a way that meets the need of the present occasion for the building up of the church. The Berkeley Version says, &ldquo;But only what serves well to improve the occasion,&rdquo; and the Interlinear Greek-English New Testament says, &ldquo;To improvement of the need.&rdquo; This is meaningful. Building up implies the improvement of the present occasion. When the brother mentioned above comes to speak with us, he presents a need of the occasion in that he has a problem with the church. His situation is poor, and it needs to be improved. The improvement depends on how we speak to him. We may speak in a way to improve the occasion or to make the occasion worse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking from the Anointing<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>This kind of speaking must be in the spirit and must go along with the inner anointing (1 John 2:20, 27). Otherwise, we will grieve the Holy Spirit of God, the Spirit who is holy. In order to speak with others in a proper way, we need to take care of the inner anointing. We should check to see if we have the inner anointing with peace and joy while we speak. If we have the inner anointing with peace and joy, it is good to continue our speaking, but if we have the inner feeling that the Holy Spirit is checking us from within, and we do not have peace and joy, we are grieving Him. Our speaking has much to do with whether or not we grieve the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We must admit that many times we have grieved the Holy Spirit in this way. Many times we are careless about our speaking. We may have felt that we should not speak in a certain way, but we still spoke in the way of causing damage to the building up of the church. Our speech, our word, must be good to meet the need of the present occasion for the building up of the church. Otherwise, our word will be unhealthy and unwholesome. This kind of word damages. We are here for the building up of the church. If we were not for the building up of the church, there would be no need to meet together. Our purpose in being here is the testimony of the church life. The subtlety, the wiles, of the enemy is simply to tear down this building. There is a real struggle between the building up and the tearing down. We are not complaining against any persons; we are accusing the enemy, Satan, who is doing his best to frustrate the building. Many of us are careless and unaware of how much Satan has used our mouths to tear down. We need to learn the lessons.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Practice, and Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
