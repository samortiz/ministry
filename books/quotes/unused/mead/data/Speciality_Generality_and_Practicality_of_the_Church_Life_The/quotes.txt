[2]  The chapters of this book are basically comprised of messages given during a time of training in the summer of 1971 in Los Angeles, California.
[3]  The speciality of the church life is the faith Rev 14:12; Gal 1:23; 2 Tim 4:7 which is composed of the beliefs concerning the Bible, God, Christ, the work of Christ, salvation, and the church.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE THE SPECIALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 4:13-16; Gal 1:23; 2 Tim 4:7; 1 Tim 6:12; Jude 3, 24; Acts 6:7; 13:8; 14:22; Gal 3:25; 6:10; 1 Tim 1:19; 3:9; 4:1, 6; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim 3:8; Titus 1:13; Rev 14:12
[5]  In this book I have the burden to cover the speciality, generality, and practicality of the church life.
[6]  So when we say the speciality of the church life is the faith, we mean the faith which is the object of our believing.
[7]  Christ was the very God in eternity John 1:1 and became a man in time John 1:14 .
[8]  Thus, we see that Christ is all: God, man, the Creator, the creature, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Savior, the Redeemer, the Lord, the Head of all, the Head of the church, the Lord of lords and King of kings.
[9]  These are the six main items of the proper Christian faith.
[10]  All real Christians do not have any disputations about these items.
[11]  Some may disagree with the point, one city, one church, but as a proper Christian we have to believe that the church is both universally one and locally one.
[12]  This doesn't mean, however, that a real believer in Christ who does not agree with one city, one church is not saved.
[13]  Still he or she is saved, but there is something lacking, not for salvation, but for the proper church life.
[14]  If we take something away, we will surely be divisive, and if we add something to it, we will also be divisive.
[15]  Due to the deadness of the Reformed churches and the Brethren, the Lord reacted in the following matters.
[16]  First the Lord raised up some dear saints in the matter of the inner life.
[17]  God's intention is to have a church, to have a Body for Christ.
[18]  The recovery of the church life is basically dependent on the recovery of the oneness and reality of the church.
[19]  Those opposing the recovery of the church are not indifferent Christians, but some of the Christians who are so much for the knowledge of the Bible, who are so much for the inner life, who are so much for evangelism, and who are so much for the Pentecostal, charismatic things.
[20]  THE ATTITUDE OF THE WRITERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT TOWARD THE GIFTS
[21]  In the New Testament we see the gifts, but we have to consider the whole New Testament.
[22]  In the book of Acts we see that Paul was powerful in divine healing during his early ministry Acts 14:9-10; 19:11-12 though he did not stress it, but in his latter ministry when his spiritual son, Timothy, had stomach trouble, he only told him not to drink water, but to drink a little wine 1 Tim 5:23 .
[23]  In Ephesians, the book on the church, Paul does not say anything about the miraculous gifts.
[24]  Paul knew that the best way to build up the church was not with teachings, nor with the gifts, but by the Spirit with life.
[25]  In this chapter we will begin to see the generality of the church life.
[26]  This is the reason Paul took such a general attitude in Romans 14.
[27]  This is not only a principle for individuals; it is also the principle for all the local churches.
[28]  We must not only be general toward individuals, but also toward other churches.
[29]  We should not say that a certain way is the best way to practice the church life, or that a certain way is the best way to have a local church.
[30]  At the present time I and so many others feel that to exercise the spirit and to take care of the inner life by pray-reading and feeding on the Lord Jesus is the most profitable way for us to have the proper church life.
[31]  As to the matter of eating, whether a Christian brother eats this or another eats that, neither should criticize the other.
[32]  Romans 16:17 says, "Keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them."
[33]  This verse can only be applied where the church life is proper.
[34]  It must practice the church life with the proper and balanced teachings of the Apostle Paul the tempered teachings, not the untempered teachings.
[35]  Suppose a local church overemphasizes head covering, telling everyone that the head covering is a specific thing in the church life and all the sisters must have their head covered.
[36]  Then Titus 3:10 says clearly that a man who is sectarian lit. after he is admonished once or twice, reject, because division damages the Body of Christ.
[37]  In a local church none should do anything that damages God's Person, humanity, or the Body of Christ.
[38]  In the foregoing chapter we pointed out that God is mainly for four things.
[39]  God's primary consideration is that as long as you love and worship Him as your unique God, as long as you love humanity and do nothing to damage it in any manner, such as fornication, extortion, etc., as long as you honor Christ, respect Him, receive Him, follow Him, love Him, and take Him as your Redeemer, as your life, as your Lord, and as your everything, and as long as you love the Body of Christ, the church, and live for it, you will be a person whom God will use very much.
[40]  Now we come to the last matter, the practicality of the church life.
[41]  This is also something that we have learned from history.
[42]  Although we were not able to be in so many things during the past twenty centuries, we have been able to study history, including biographies and autobiographies of many.
[43]  As a result, we realize that today the best thing, the primary thing, the first thing, that we have to take care of in the practicality of the church life is the matter of life.
[44]  If there is no growth, it means that either there is no life, or there is something wrong.
[45]  Why do I say that the growth in life is the primary thing in the practicality of the church life?
[46]  If we pay our attention only to teachings and gifts, we are still a local church, but I assure you, either we will be a dead one or a dissenting one.
[47]  CHAPTER SIX THE PRACTICALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22; 1:7; 2:22; 3:16a; 4:3; 1:13; Eph 6:17-18; Rom 10:12; 1 Cor 12:3, 13b; 14:31, 32
[48]  In the last chapter we saw that life is the primary thing in the practicality of the church life.
[49]  We need life and growth in life, and for life and growth in life we need the eating of the Lord.
[50]  Next we have the fifth verse, 2 Timothy 3:16: "All Scripture is God-breathed."
[51]  If you know that the Lord Jesus is the Spirit, the breath, it is easy to breathe Him in. One who does not know how to breathe may say that calling on the Lord is too simple.
[52]  In the Scripture reading at the beginning of this chapter we included 2 Timothy 4:3 and 1:13.
[53]  The Lord is the Spirit, the Lord be with your spirit, you have a strong spirit, you have to exercise your spirit to call on the Lord, and you have to pray-read His Word these are the healthy teachings the Lord has given us for the practice of the church life.
[54]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE PRACTICALITY OF THE CHURCH LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: John 15:12, 17; Matt 20:25-27; 23:8-11; 1 Pet 5:1-3, 5; Rom 12:4-5; Rev 1:5b-6a; 5:9b-10a; John 15:5, 8, 16; 21:15b, 16b, 17b; Acts 8:1; 11:19-22
[55]  In the last two chapters we have seen that life is the primary thing in the practice of the church life.
[56]  For the experience and enjoyment of life we need to feed on the Lord Jesus.
[57]  Matthew 20:25-28; 23:8-11; and 1 Peter 5:1-3, 5 reveal that the rulers of the nations exercise lordship over the people, but in the church there is no exercise of lordship.
[58]  No one in the church, regardless of how much responsibility he bears, how much life he ministers to the saints, or how much he has been afforded the Lord's grace for the building up of the local churches, should ever exercise any lordship over others.
[59]  We also need to practice the universal priesthood Rev 1:6; 5:10 , which means that every believer is a priest.
[60]  In the Body of Christ we are members, and in the service to God the Father we are priests.
