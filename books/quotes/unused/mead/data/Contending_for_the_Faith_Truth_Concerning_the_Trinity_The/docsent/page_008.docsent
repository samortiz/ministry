   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT A HERESY TWO DIVINE FATHERS, TWO LIFE-GIVING SPIRITS, AND THREE GODS!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When it comes to the matter of the Triune God, many Christians only care for their tradition, not for the clear, accurate word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to preserve their tradition, they twist the words of Scripture and will not return absolutely to the pure word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of this tradition, a fight is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although we do not like to fight, we cannot avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, we must point out that many Christians hold a concept, which is certainly heretical, of two divine Fathers, two life-giving Spirits, and some, even of three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It may be that they are not aware of this or that they hold it unconsciously and, thus, they may deny that they hold it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the concept held by them actually is heretical because it implies two divine Fathers, two life-giving Spirits, and, in some cases, three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE BASIC REVELATION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the basic revelation of the Bible, God's economy is to work Christ into His believers that they may become a living church to express God on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in Christian history and in today's situation, we do not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What we see is merely a Christian religion with the Triune God as their object of worship plus a Savior who saves sinners from hell to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In today's Christianity we see neither the enjoyment of the all-inclusive Christ nor the practice of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason, during the past fifty years the Lord has come to show us His recovery of the experience of Christ and of the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Throughout the years that we have been burdened by the Lord with His recovery, we have been attacked by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have been attacked because we have received a clear vision from the Lord regarding who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord has shown us that Christ is the all-inclusive, wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is God, the Creator, the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and also the proper man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is the reality of all divine attributes and of all human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The hinge of all the aspects of this all-inclusive Christ is the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have no choice except to tell our fellow Christians that our Savior, Jesus Christ, is the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Undoubtedly, He is the Lamb of God and the Redeemer, but these are simply two aspects of this all-inclusive One.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ, the all-inclusive One, is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible even describes Him with the term "all and in all" Col 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is light, life, righteousness, holiness, redemption, salvation, and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In our experience, He is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because we proclaim this, we are accused of being heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our critics say that we teach heresy in telling people that Christ, the Son, is the Father as well as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today, many Christians do not believe that Christ is not only the Son, but also the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A FALSE ACCUSATION REPUDIATED</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some of our critics say, "When Witness Lee teaches that Christ is the Father and the Spirit, he is teaching modalism and denying the co-inherence and co-existence of the three Persons of the Godhead."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I deny this accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the critics were to ask me whether I believe in Matthew 3:16 and 17, where the Son is standing, the Spirit is descending, and the Father is speaking, I would answer that I believe it at least as much as they do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, were present at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I fully believe in the co-inherence and co-existence of the Three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I not only believe Matthew 3:16 and 17, but all the verses that pertain to this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, "Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ...."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In these verses, the Father is the One "who is and who was and who is coming"; the Spirit is the "seven Spirits"; and the Son is Jesus Christ, "the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here, the Father, the Spirit, and the Son are not only present after Christ's resurrection, but even after His ascension and after Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many other verses reveal the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here we see the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, Ephesians 3:14-17 says, "I bow my knees unto the Father that He would grant you to be strengthened with power through His Spirit that Christ may make His home in your hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>" Once again, the Father, the Spirit, and Christ are all present at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The charge that I am a modalist is false, and I absolutely repudiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Modalism teaches that God is not at the same time Father and Son and that the revelation of the Son ended with the ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The permanence of the Father, Son, and Spirit was denied by modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Modalism is a heresy, and we do not believe in it.</S>
