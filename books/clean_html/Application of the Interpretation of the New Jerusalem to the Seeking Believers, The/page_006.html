We ask You to do a particular thing—to show us the second application of the New Jerusalem. Thank You for the last message. You have shown us the first application. Amen.<p>In the previous message, the Lord has shown us the first application of the New Jerusalem. To apply the base of the New Jerusalem, we must have our being and do everything in our walk and work for the Lord to participate in His move based upon the golden nature of God. The building up of the New Jerusalem, which is a golden mount, is to make us divine, golden. The sisters’ fellowship must be based upon the golden nature of God. We co-workers who are participating in the Lord’s move bear a heavy burden. We have to realize that our move in the Lord’s move should be based upon His golden nature. The first application of the New Jerusalem is to have everything that belongs to us based upon God’s golden nature to make us golden, divine, day by day. When this is completed, that will be the consummation of the building up of the golden mount, the golden city.
