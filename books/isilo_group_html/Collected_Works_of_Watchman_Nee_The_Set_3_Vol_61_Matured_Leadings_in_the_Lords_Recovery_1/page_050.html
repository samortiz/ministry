The young man thought the requirement was too high, and he left in sorrow. After this the Lord told the disciples that it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom (vv. 18-25). Let me explain this a little more in detail. Not only is a camel too big; even a mouse is too big to go through. The real issue here is that entrance into the kingdom is hard not only for a rich man but for any man who depends on himself. Only God can do this work. During the past two thousand years, thank God, many camels have passed through the needle's eye. The mistake of the young ruler was in trying to do it by himself. His mistake was not in loving his riches but in his thought that God could not do it because he himself could not do it. We all love money; none of us can give up everything. If God becomes the source of our faith, however, even a camel can go through the needle's eye. This is the gospel. We think that it is impossible with man, but we have forgotten that it is possible with God. No man can go through the eye of a needle; no man can hand himself over, but God does not say that we have to do it by ourselves. He says that we can do it by Him. If we call on Him for help, even a camel can go through the needle's eye. We know that we cannot do it, but it is wrong to think that God cannot do it.</p><p>It is true that everyone loves money and that no one is willing to forsake everything. However, what is impossible with man is possible with God. This is the reason we find Zaccheus in Luke 19. We know that it is easy for a young man to become excited. When he is burning, he can throw away his money easily, but an old man has handled money for many years; he knows what money can bring him. It is hard to change an old man. Mammon is like opium; if we only take a little of it, we can drop it easily, but if we take a great deal of it, it will be hard to shake the addiction. The more we take, the harder it is to be free from it. The Lord said to Zaccheus that He would go into his house that very day. Most people would object to such a move and think, "Lord, You are an outsider from another town. You do not know Zaccheus. You have been fooled by him." But the Lord ignored such thoughts (vv. 1-7). To everyone's surprise, Zaccheus stood up and said, "Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much" (v. 8). Zaccheus only caught a glimpse of the Lord's glory, and everything he had was gone. He saw one glimpse of Christ, and he forsook everything to follow Him that same day. This is surely a camel going through the eye of a needle. When the Lord saw what Zaccheus had done, He said, "Today salvation has come to this house" (v. 9). If Zaccheus had tried to do it by himself, he would not have succeeded, but salvation came to his house, and he did it. In comparing verse 5 with verse 9, we can see that salvation refers to the Lord Jesus. The young man in chapter eighteen had his eyes set on man. This was the reason he could not go through the eye of the needle. The old man in chapter nineteen set his eyes on the salvation of the Lord Jesus. This is the reason he was able to go through the eye of the needle. It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, but during the past two thousand years, countless numbers of people have done this, emerging from the other side to serve the Lord. If a man truly wants to follow the Lord and truly trusts in the Lord, the Lord will enable him go through the eye of the needle.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
