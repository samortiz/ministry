   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Establishing Our Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It would be ideal if in every city there was a church that we were at peace with in our conscience; then there would be no need for us to set up other meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the practices of some Christians bother our conscience; the way they do things makes it impossible for us to maintain a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believers should love one another, but we do not love one another merely because we serve the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Brotherly love is based on whether we can preserve a pure conscience; this is not a debatable doctrinal point.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we can maintain a pure conscience, we can pass through anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we can maintain a pure conscience, we absolutely must not establish our meetings in any locality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The preceding four items are negative not participating, not interfering, not criticizing, and not mentioning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the positive side, we should take every opportunity to preach the gospel to unbelievers and to minister life to believers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not Caring for Others Criticism</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>but Standing before God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As long as we have a proper attitude, we do not need to fear criticism or opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not expect that there will not be any criticism or opposition; the only thing that we should care about is our standing before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we care about what others say and are influenced by them, then we will not properly follow the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must learn to be humble, to not fear the criticisms of others, and to live before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is wrong for some brothers to seek to draw others into our meetings; other brothers are afraid of criticism, and this also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The proper attitude is to live as though Christianity does not exist and know only of the Lord, sinners, and Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must learn the lessons of life before the Lord and learn to receive grace to seek opportunities to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If someone misunderstands and criticizes us, we should simply let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not be proud, but if we are afraid of criticism, we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fact that we do not participate in Christianity will cause some to criticize us; we cannot avoid criticism for not participating in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must keep a pure conscience in order to stand on the ground of oneness and walk in the way of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The issue at hand is not of leaving the denominations but of having a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The most important thing is to live purely before God.</S>
