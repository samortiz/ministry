It speaks of the proper attitude a man of God should have towards the world. As we sing this song, we touch a spirit whose purity rarely has been found in the past five hundred years. As we learn to touch the Lord's Spirit with our spirit and as we turn our heart fully to the Lord as the writer did, we can lay aside every earthly possession.</p><ol class="decimal"><li>Having seen the world's fair beauty,<br />Lord, I would be blind once more,<br />Lest I lose the loving Presence<br />And Delight I knew before.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having seen the world's fair beauty,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord, I would be blind once more,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest I lose the loving Presence<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Delight I knew before.<br /><br /></li><li>Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,<br />I can see in paradise,<br />But while here on earth His mercy<br />For my blindness will suffice.<br /><br /></li><li>I no more would be delivered<br />From my thorn, but look for grace,<br />While within the veil His glory<br />Shineth brightly on my face.<br /><br /></li><li>In the deep dark night, His beauty<br />I by faith, not sight, may trace;<br />He was ridiculed and hated,<br />Yet I see His glorious face.<br /><br /></li><li>Sun and moonlight far surpassing,<br />Clouds and Milky Way o'erspread,<br />Is the glory all transcending<br />Shining from His thorn-crowned head.<br /><br /></li></ol><p>Five or six hundred years ago, there was a person by the name of Miss Bride who was greatly used by the Lord to perform miracles. She laid hands on Dara, and the little sister, who was born blind and who was then in her teens, recovered her sight. After Miss Bride prayed for her, her eyes were opened and everything around was new to her. She was very happy and greatly enjoyed the sight of the sun, the moon, the stars, and everything around her. After a few days, however, she went back to Miss Bride in great sorrow. When Miss Bride asked her what she wanted, she said she wanted someone to pray for her again. Miss Bride asked, "Do you have some other illness?" She answered, "Please pray for me to have my eyes blind again. The beautiful scenery is distracting me from the Lord." Later Miss Bride put Dara's words together in a poem and composed the above song. We can see that this is a song from the heart of one who is absolutely single for the Lord. It shows us the kind of attitude such a person has towards the world.</p><p>Tonight we want to talk about the matter of handing oneself over. In order to serve the Lord, we have to hand ourselves over. First, we have to see the meaning of handing oneself over. Next, we need to see what we should do after we have handed ourselves over. Before this, however, let us first talk about the loss and recovery of the truth concerning handing oneself over.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 61: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (1) &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
