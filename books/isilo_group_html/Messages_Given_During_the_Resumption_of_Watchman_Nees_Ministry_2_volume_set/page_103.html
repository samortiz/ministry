It means that one is willing to submit to the authority that God has put upon a person. We are ourselves responsible for handing ourselves over. In the Old Testament, when men laid their hands on the heads of the goats, it meant that they were willing to hand the goats over to the priests. If they wanted to keep the goats, they should not lay their hands on the goats, because they were not willing to hand the goats over. The Bible says that a man has to come to the altar willingly and offer his sacrifices willingly. God wants man to hand himself over in a voluntary way. The Acts of the Apostles records the matter of baptism; it also records the matter of the laying on of hands. The laying on of hands signifies the acceptance of the authority of the church. Today, man sees that baptism is a separation of the believers from the worldly system. But they do not see that the laying on of hands is an acceptance of God's authority that He establishes in the church. When a man refuses authority, confusion results. If a man is willing to hand himself over to the serving ones, it will become easy for the serving ones to do their job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRINCIPLE OF THE WORK&#151;<br>THE CO-WORKERS HANDING OVER THEMSELVES</H2><P>The principle in the work is the same. The co-workers in all the places should first hand themselves over and place themselves under the Head and be directed by the Head. Only then can the Lord do something, and only then will the work have a way to go on. We hope that in these days the Lord will at least give us a way to go on.</P><P>From now on, we have to accept the judgment of the Body. All major decisions and directions must be placed in the hands of the Body. If we do this, we will have life, power, and direction. Otherwise, there will be rebellion and insubordination. If we hand ourselves over, within us we will surely feel an "amen" and a sweet sense.</P><P>The situation in Foochow in the past has been one of confusion. The meetings there became a little kingdom by themselves. The saints were closed and would not fellowship with others. Their hearts were not broad enough and did not include all the believers; they did not see the unique Body of Christ. The way the Body will be manifested in the future is determined by the nature of the testimony of the local churches today. The local churches today are the models of the coming universal church. This is like an architect designing a house: first he builds a model. Although the model is not very big, what it represents is in nature the same as what will be built. First Corinthians 12 speaks of the universal Body, on the one hand, and on the other hand, the Body life in the local churches.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OUTLET OF THE WORK&#151;<br>HANDING ONESELF OVER TO THE BODY<br>TO BE A THREE-DIMENSIONAL VESSEL</H2><P>In our work we must find an outlet for the Lord. What we are lacking today is not power, but an outlet for the Lord. The problem among us is that the co-workers have not properly handed themselves over. Although there is a little power, this power is not great. A three-dimensional cup can hold a lot of water. But a flat piece of glass or a broken cup cannot hold any water. Because our work has been "flat," we have lost many blessings. The tabernacle and the temple in the Old Testament both typify the church, the Body of Christ, in the New Testament. Only when this Body becomes a three-dimensional Body can it be a vessel of God. Only then can it contain God's riches and be a strong and powerful testimony for the Lord.</P><P>Not only should the co-workers do this, the brothers and sisters should also consecrate themselves fully in this way. No matter where he or she is, every brother and sister should be a servant of God. Here all of us need a specific declaration, and should count the cost, and hand ourselves over.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_102.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_104.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 103</div><br></body></html>
