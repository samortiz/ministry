Abolishing the Ordinances<br />
of Human Living and Religion</h2>
<p>People in Taiwan do not understand the differences between northern and southern Chinese in their ways of living, because Taiwan is like a melting pot that blends together people from different places of China. Many students from Taiwan who study in the United States have married Caucasians or people of other ethnic groups. This is a great blending. People of different races are all blended together in the United States. On the cross the Lord Jesus abolished the ordinances between peoples, slaying the enmity and creating the new man. God is also arranging the environment for people to be blended together. Such environments are for the practical manifestation of the one new man.</p>
<p>In addition to the ordinances created by different ways of living, there are also religious ordinances. For example, some Christians favor baptizing people by immersion, but others insist on baptizing people by sprinkling. This has become an ordinance that separates Christians. Also, the way Christians practice the Lord&rsquo;s table can become an ordinance that divides the believers. We must see that on the cross the Lord abolished all the ordinances, including the ordinances of human living, culture, and religion (Eph. 2:15). The Lord&rsquo;s desire is not only for us to be delivered from sin, the devil, the old man, and the world but also for us to be delivered from ordinances. Being delivered from ordinances does not mean the abolishment of distinctions in position and age. If we did this, there would be confusion and disorder.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ABOLISHING THE ORDINANCES<br />
FOR THE CREATION OF THE ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>The Lord has delivered us from sin, the devil, the old man, and the world. He will eventually deliver us from ordinances for the purpose of manifesting us as the one new man. Hence, Ephesians 2:15 says, &ldquo;Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Intention and Purpose<br />
in Creating Man</h2>
<p>We need light when we read the Bible. God&rsquo;s desire for the one new man was revealed when He created Adam. When God created man, He did not create many people. God created only one man, Adam (Gen. 2:7), but Adam was a corporate man. The Bible says that God created man in His image and according to His likeness (1:26). This means that man is a photograph of God in order to reflect God. God placed this man in a high position. God did not create thousands of men who would reflect him; He created only one man to be His reflection. However, this man was damaged by Satan. Hence, God&rsquo;s purpose to have man as His reflection was foiled. Because the first man, Adam, was damaged, the Lord Jesus came to the earth to be the second man (1 Cor. 15:47) in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s original purpose in creating man. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was the image, the reflection, of God (Col. 1:15).</p>
<h2 class="head2">All Believers Becoming<br />
the One New Man in Christ</h2>
<p>Because we have believed in the Lord Jesus, we have been regenerated in Him to become His reproduction (John 1:12; 3:6; 2 Cor. 3:18). Hence, just as the Lord Jesus is a reflection of God, we should also be a reflection of God. From God&rsquo;s perspective, believers are not individual persons; we are one corporate man. In Christ we are the one new man. Ephesians 4:24 says that the new man &ldquo;was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.&rdquo; Therefore, this new man has replaced the old man as the reflection of God. In the old man, Satan not only utilizes sin to damage man and the world to usurp man, but he also utilizes ways of living to create divisions among men. Hence, there is discord not only between countries, but even people within the same country are separated by differences in their ways of living. As a result, God&rsquo;s purpose in creating man as His reflection has been completely annulled. However, Christ, who is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4), was incarnated. When we were saved and put into Christ, we became His reproduction. In Christ we have been delivered from sin, the devil, the old man, the flesh, the world, and the ordinances related to different ways of living and have become one new man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:15 says that the creation of the new man was accomplished by Christ in Himself, but verse 24 of chapter 4 says that the believers have to put on the new man. Although the creation of the new man has been accomplished, we still need to put on the new man practically. This may be likened to a garment that has been sewn but still must be put on. To put on the new man means to put on the church life. The living that is in human society is the living of the old man; most unsaved people live a befuddled life. Their social life is the old man, but the church life is the new man. When we put on the new man, we put on the church life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
