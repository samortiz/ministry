<p>God&rsquo;s economy is God becoming a man that man may become God in life and in nature (but not in the Godhead) to produce the organic Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Chronicles,</em> p. 75)</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BECOMING MAN AND MAN BECOMING GOD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;God becoming man and man becoming God&rdquo; is the economy of God; it is beyond the comprehension of angels and men...There is a line concerning the economy of God recorded in the Scriptures, showing us how God became man to make man God. The Bible shows us how man can become God to have a God-man living and thus become an organism of God, which is the Body of Christ. (<em>The High Peak of the Vision and the Reality of the Body of Christ,</em> p. 27)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>God made His eternal economy in Christ. The Christ revealed in the New Testament is the embodiment of the Triune God and all the processes through which He has passed, including creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. In such a Christ God made His eternal economy. Therefore, Christ is the element, sphere, means, goal, and aim of God&rsquo;s eternal economy. Christ is everything in God&rsquo;s economy. In fact, all the contents of the eternal economy of God are simply Christ. Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s eternal plan. Christ is the element and the sphere in which, with which, and through which God carries out His household administration to have the church as the household of God and the Body of Christ. (<em>The Conclusion of the New Testament,</em> p. 2052)</p>

<p>The Body of Christ is the Triune God&rsquo;s eternal heart&rsquo;s desire and His ultimate purpose. It is also something that the tripartite men can never think of nor hope and ask for. However, this is the Triune God&rsquo;s anticipated multiplication and His expected increase. This multiplication and increase are God and Christ multiplying and increasing within us, the redeemed people. This is something beyond the imagination of all the religionists and philosophers, yet we who have been graced by God can actually taste it and participate in it for eternity. (<em>The Issue of the Union of the Consummated Spirit of the Triune God and the Regenerated Spirit of the Believers,</em> p. 55)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE ECONOMY BEING GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL PLAN<br />
TO DISPENSE CHRIST INTO HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The word <em>economy</em> is an anglicized form of the Greek word <em>oikonomia,</em> which means &ldquo;household law or household management or household administration and derivatively administrative dispensation, plan, economy.&rdquo; The divine economy is God&rsquo;s eternal plan to dispense Christ into His chosen people to produce, constitute, and build up the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 1:10; 3:8-10; 1 Tim. 1:4). Since Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, for God to dispense Christ into His chosen people actually means that God dispenses Himself in Christ into His chosen people. In brief, God&rsquo;s economy is to gain a Body for Christ. This Body is the enlargement of the Triune God for His expression that He may be satisfied. (<em>Life-study of Job,</em> p. 205)</p>
<h2 class="head1">BECOMING ONE WITH GOD AND<br />
LIVING HIM FOR HIS CORPORATE EXPRESSION</h2>
<p>God has an economy, and this economy involves a plan with many arrangements. God&rsquo;s aim in His economy is to have a group of human beings who have His life and nature inwardly and His image and likeness outwardly. This group of people is a corporate entity, the Body of Christ, to be one with Him and live Him for His corporate expression. As God is expressed not only by the Body but also through the Body, He is glorified. When He is glorified, His people are also glorified in His glorification. In this way God and man are one in glory.</p>
<p>In this oneness we, God&rsquo;s people, are not separate from God, but we definitely remain distinct from Him. We are one with God in life, in nature, in element, in essence, and in constitution. We are also one with Him in purpose, goal, image, and likeness. Nevertheless, no matter how much we are one with God, we do not share His Godhead and will never share it. Man remains man, and God remains God. Yes, in the incarnation of Christ, God became a man, but He did not give up His Godhead. Rather, He has reserved and preserved the Godhead for Himself alone. Thus, man is still limited, and God still possesses the unique Godhead.</p>
<p>The group of human beings who are one with God in every way except in the Godhead is symbolized, signified, depicted, and portrayed by a wonderful, holy city&mdash;the New Jerusalem. (<em>Life-study of Jeremiah,</em> p. 82)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MAIN CONTENTS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The main contents of the New Testament are that the Triune God has an eternal economy according to His good pleasure to dispense Himself into His chosen and redeemed people in His life and in His nature, to make all of them the same as He is in life and nature, to make them His duplication that they may express Him. This corporate expression will consummate in the New Jerusalem. Thus, the New Jerusalem is simply the enlarged, the increased, incarnation consummated in full, that is, the fullness of the Triune God for Him to express Himself in His divinity mingled with humanity. (<em>Life-study of Job,</em> p. 64)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>My intention, my burden, is to show you that the entire Bible speaks of only one thing&mdash;grace, which is God, who is the New Jerusalem. Grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Regardless of what subject the Bible touches, it is concerned with the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;being manifested as grace consummating in the New Jerusalem. This is the highest and central revelation shown to us in the entire New Testament. Hence, we cannot touch the righteousness of God without touching grace. God&rsquo;s righteousness and God&rsquo;s grace are not two different things. Romans 5:17 refers to both the abundance of grace and the abundance of righteousness. Righteousness always accompanies grace and is its result. (<em>The Experience of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ&rsquo;s Life,</em> p. 56)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Today the processed and consummated Triune God has become the life-giving Spirit and is all-inclusive. As such a One, He is in us to bring us all into His organism. In this organism is the organic element that God wants. It is not the outward explanation of doctrines. The more we are right in doctrine, the less organic element we have. The more we remain in the &ldquo;photo,&rdquo; the less we are in the living person. I hope that our eyes will be opened to see where our real need is. We need to be in the processed and consummated Triune God, taking Him as our life and our person. We are on the cross, and yet in His resurrection we have been resurrected, and we have ascended with Him. Here, God and man are mingled to produce an organism. This is accomplished by grace. The grace in God&rsquo;s economy is the embodiment of God for man to receive as his enjoyment and supply. We should learn to receive such an embodied grace that we may have this enjoyment and supply. As a result, we will be full of the organic element in our inner being and thus become the organism of God. (<em>The Law and Grace of God in His Economy,</em> p. 43)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>The grace in God&rsquo;s economy is God&rsquo;s embodiment. God became flesh to dwell among us, full of grace, and of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. When God comes, grace comes. God&rsquo;s embodiment is grace to us. When we receive grace, we obtain God.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy is to work out an organism for the Divine Trinity. How does He work this out? It is by His becoming flesh to be a man that His divinity and humanity might be united and mingled to produce a God-man. This God-man is grace. Whomever He meets, He is grace to them; wherever He goes, He is grace. He is simply grace. If we have Him, we have grace. Hence, in the Bible grace is called the grace of Christ. The embodied grace came for us to receive as our enjoyment and supply. However, there are few who see this today, even fewer who preach this, and very few who live this out.</p>
<p>If we experience the grace in God&rsquo;s economy, there will be a consummation&mdash;the organic Body of Christ. Christ to us is grace; as such, He comes into us to be our life and person. He not only lives in us but also lives with us. Moreover, He wants us to live along with Him. This is to enjoy grace as our inner supply. Such an enjoyment of grace spontaneously produces a result. This result is not merely that we do good. Rather, it is that Christ lives with us and we with Him. When we live Christ and magnify Christ, we become the living members, organic members, of Christ, and we all are organically joined as an organism, which is the church. This organism grows continually, and ultimately there will be a consummation&mdash;the New Jerusalem.
