   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ANOINTING AND THE PURPOSE OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The central purpose of God's salvation is to work Himself into human beings and be mingled with them as one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Likewise, the function of the anointing is to anoint God into us, so that we may be mingled with God as one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, practically speaking, the purpose of God's salvation is achieved through the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is no anointing, the purpose of God's salvation can never be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The anointing is thus a significant factor in the entire salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Triune God came into us as the Holy Spirit, He became mingled with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, the purpose of His salvation the mingling of God and man is accomplished in us in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the work of God to mingle Himself with man is not an instantaneous process.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since we were regenerated and the Holy Spirit entered into us, this mingling has been going on continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Throughout the entire lifetime of a Christian, all the work of the Holy Spirit upon him is to fulfill the work of mingling God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How does the Holy Spirit work this mingling into us?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He does it by anointing us as the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have said that the moving of the Holy Spirit means the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is not motionless within us, but is ever-moving and ever-active.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This movement and action is a kind of anointing, which anoints more and more of God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the more the Holy Spirit anoints us, the more God can mingle with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE ANOINTING AND THE FELLOWSHIP OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is a very close relationship between the anointing and the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fellowship of life is the flowing of life, the flowing together of God and all those possessing His life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The anointing is the mingling of God with all those belonging to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The purpose of the flowing of life is to flow God into us, while the purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These two are two aspects of one thing; they are very closely related and difficult to separate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us now see why the anointing and the fellowship of life are two aspects of the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We know that God is life, and God is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning God as life, He flows in us unceasingly this is the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Concerning God as the Spirit, He moves in us continually this is the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, life and the Spirit are inseparable, for the Spirit includes life, and life is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Life is the content of the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These two are the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , which is two-in-one and indivisible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the fellowship of life and the anointing are also inseparable, being two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE ANOINTING AND THE APPLYING OF THE BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A very close relationship also exists between the anointing and applying the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us, that we may have fellowship with God and be mingled and united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When speaking of maintaining the fellowship, the New Testament brings up the matters of sprinkling the blood and applying the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sprinkling of the blood is to cleanse away all that should not be there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The anointing of the ointment is to anoint us with the elements of God, even with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is just like someone painting furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result of the painting action, the paint is applied to the furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit coming to man is God coming to man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And by the Spirit moving and anointing in man, God is wrought into man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, on the negative side, the blood cleanses away all the things that we should not have.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the positive side, the ointment anoints us with what we should have.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What we should not have are the sins, and what we should have is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By the continual cleansing and anointing of the blood and the ointment, we maintain our union with the Lord always.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we apply the blood and allow it to wash us continually, the more we will experience the anointing and feel the living presence and moving of God; thus, we will have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the anointing and the applying of the blood are also inseparable.</S>
