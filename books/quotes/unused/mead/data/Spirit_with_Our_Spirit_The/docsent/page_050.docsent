   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another portion of the Word that shows the sanctifying Spirit is John 16:8-11.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These verses say, "And when He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe into Me; and concerning righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged."</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning Sin in Adam</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First, the Spirit convicts the world concerning sin in Adam because they do not believe into Christ John 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 5:12 says that sin entered into the world, into the people of the earth, through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Adam was a big entry for sin to come in to all his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to repent of the sin in Adam and believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The sin which came into us from Adam causes us not to believe into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be born in Adam and not believe into Christ makes us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are companions of sin.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Righteousness is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without Christ, there is no righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the whole earth, in the whole universe, righteousness is in Christ, and He is God's righteousness given to us as our righteousness 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is altogether in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 4:25 says Christ was resurrected for our justification, for our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If Christ only died on the cross and still remained in the tomb, there would be no righteousness and we could never be made righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Justification, to make Christ our righteousness, is through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to remember that Luke 15 was the Lord's parable, and John 16 was the Lord's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both came out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus, the One who is wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only Christ could have given us the parable in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And only He could have given us the teaching in John 16.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The teaching in John 16 has the crucial major points sin, righteousness, and judgment.</S>
