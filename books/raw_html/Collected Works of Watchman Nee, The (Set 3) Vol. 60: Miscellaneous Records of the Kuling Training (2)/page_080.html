<h2 class="head2">Persecutions from the Roman Catholic Church</h2><h2 class="head3">A Graduate from Cambridge University</h2><p>Much persecution came from the Roman Catholic Church. The Church's persecutions were by far the most serious. There was a graduate of Cambridge University who would not subscribe to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. The Church sent men for him and was about to take him to the stake. They tortured him. He meekly accepted the verdicts and gladly took his last meal. The executioners mocked him, saying, "If your God is real, you will not be burnt even if you go through the fire. Put your finger on the candle and try it." The student said, "Your fire can only burn my finger. But this fire will purify me and take me to the Lord much faster than the chariots of fire that took Elijah." When the fire spread over his body, he prayed earnestly, "Lord, do not judge Your servant. There is no one living who is righteous before You." One brother came to him, saying, "When my day comes, I want to be like you." Another priest came and shouted, "I am not the one who burns you." He turned around and comforted the priest. When he was about to give up his last breath, he shouted, "Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus," and committed his soul to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head3">Brother Daniel in France</h2><p>[Translator's Note: The names of the following persons are translated from Chinese. We cannot ascertain the source from which Mr. Nee quoted the following stories.]</p><p>Brother Daniel was a Frenchman. He did not agree with the Catholic Church. One day the archbishop of the church told the jailer to send Daniel to him the following Monday. The jailer approached him and asked, "Do you know what I am going to do to you?" Daniel said, "My Lord knows what will happen to me. I believe I will die there. Thank God for being so gracious to me." He took dinner with two of his friends in the same calm way. Someone asked him, "Do you still have a heart to eat?" He answered, "For the past few years, I have learned to be a prisoner for God. Do I fear death still? I believe the Lord will give me the strength." After he was handed over to the summoner, he was sentenced to die on Saturday. When someone told him that he would be dismembered and his four limbs would be displayed on the four gates of the city, he asked, "Where are they going to put my head?" They answered, "Upon another gate." At the time of his execution, the executioner would not allow him to say a word. Yet he endured his death joyfully, gently, and patiently.</p><h2 class="head3">Henry the Englishman</h2><p>Henry was an Englishman. He was also murdered by the Roman Catholic Church. Before he died, he prayed while standing on burning charcoal, "Today I suffer not for my sin, but for upholding my faith and for inheriting the promised blessing. The One who has called me is demonstrating His life through such an act. I sacrifice my life for His sake. Flee from the lies of the priests so that you can escape the eternal fire of hell." Those who stood by him wept bitterly. After he prayed, he was put on the stake. While others were lighting the fire, he turned around and said to the crowd, "Do pray!" Soon after he died.</p><h2 class="head3">Rogis (?)</h2><p>Brother Rogis said at the time of his trial in prison, "The apostles suffered for Christ's sake. I also took up my gallows for His sake. Since God has ordained this, He will sustain me with His life and grace, and I will praise Him. I believe that the truth, which is God's word, will eventually prevail. When your law falls to the dust, God's word will prevail." One constable asked him, "Do you want to repent for your faith?" He answered firmly, "I want to affirm my preaching with my blood." The constable did not believe him, but he said, "You will know what I mean when we arrive at the execution ground." The constable said, "I will not pray for you," to which Rogis replied, "But I will pray for you." He was led to the execution ground. While he was being burned, he lifted up his hands to pray. After he expired, his hands were still lifted high.</p>
