   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The Savior to Give Repentance</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Forgiveness of Sins to Israel</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The One God has exalted to His right hand is not only the Leader but also the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Leader is related to His authority, and Savior to His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jesus incarnation made Him a man, His human living on earth qualified Him to be man s Savior, His crucifixion accomplished full redemption for man, His resurrection vindicated His redemptive work, and His exaltation inaugurated Him to be the ruling Leader so that He might be the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Peter s word in Acts 5:31, the Lord is the Savior to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To give repentance and forgiveness of sins to God s chosen people requires Christ to be exalted as a ruling Leader and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His sovereign ruling causes and leads God s chosen people to repent, and His salvation based upon His redemption affords them forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Repentance is for forgiveness of sins Mark 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On God s side, forgiveness of sins is based upon His redemption Eph 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On man s side, forgiveness of sins is through repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Repentance and forgiveness are major gifts, and only the Lord Jesus as the Leader and Savior is qualified to give them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to realize that in this universe He is the only One qualified to give repentance and forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is the Lord who has caught us and compelled us to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Otherwise, we would not have repented.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Repentance is not of us; it is a gift given by the exalted Leader and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Following repentance, we received the gift of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should praise the Lord that He is qualified to give repentance and forgiveness to God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Christ was on earth, He saved Peter, John, and many others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, although the title Savior is applied to Christ in His earthly ministry John 4:42 , He was not officially the Savior until His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We were saved officially by the Christ on the throne, by the One in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we were saved, we were seated with Him in the heavenlies Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ has saved us from the throne and to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the ascended Christ as our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Witnessed by the Disciples and the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ exalted by God to be the Leader and Savior was witnessed by the disciples and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Acts 5:32 Peter goes on to say, We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Greek word translated things here is rhema, referring to instant words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both the apostles and the Holy Spirit were witnesses of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indicates that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this verse Peter says that God gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Obedience is the way and the condition to receive and enjoy the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>7.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Son of Man</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Acts 7:55 speaks of Stephen seeing Jesus standing at the right hand of God: But being full of the Holy Spirit, he looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This verse unveils that Christ is the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God to be the comfort, encouragement, and strength to the one martyred for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Stephen saw the ascended Christ as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that the Christ who is in the heavens still has His humanity; He still possesses a human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some do not believe that Christ today is still the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They claim that Christ became a man by incarnation but that in His resurrection He put off His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They think that Christ today is merely the Son of God, that He is no longer the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, it is erroneous to teach that Christ in ascension is no longer the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In ascension Christ is still both the Son of God with divinity and the Son of Man with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Acts 7:55, Stephen saw the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This was a great vindication and encouragement to the persecuted one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 55 says that Stephen also saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord in ascension is usually referred to as sitting at the right hand of God Matt 26:64; Heb 1:3, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But Stephen saw Him standing there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sitting is for resting, whereas standing is for working.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because a member of His Body was suffering on earth, the Son of Man was seen standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that the Lord was greatly concerned for His persecuted one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Stephen did not care for the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Rather, being full of the Spirit, he looked intently into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Acts 7:2 Stephen said that the God of glory appeared to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now we are told that Stephen saw the glory of God and Jesus as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the entire New Testament this occurred only once.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, in 7:56 Stephen said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The earth rejected Stephen and was closed to him, but the heavens opened up to him, indicating that the heavens were with him and for him.</S>
