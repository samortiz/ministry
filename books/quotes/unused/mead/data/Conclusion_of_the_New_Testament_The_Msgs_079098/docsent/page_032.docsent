   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Christ is the almighty God, He, as God's Christ in His humanity, still needed to be anointed with the Spirit for His ministry to carry out God's economy.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the New Testament the phrase "full of the Holy Spirit" refers to an inward, essential filling for living, not an outward, economical filling for working Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55; 11:24 .</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit here is the Holy Spirit who descended upon the Lord Jesus at the time of His baptism for the accomplishment of His ministry and who filled Him essentially v. 1 . Therefore, Christ had the Holy Spirit both essentially as life for His being and economically as power for His ministry.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in Your sight."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that the Spirit was the means for Christ's exultation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He lived in the Holy Spirit and therefore exulted in the Spirit.</S>
