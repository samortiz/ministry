These basic lessons on life were given by Brother Witness Lee from February through November 1979 in Anaheim, California
Merely to repeat what is here in black and white will be a kind of dead speaking of knowledge according to the dead letter
These messages may be considered as groceries, which you need to cook in a living way through much, much prayer
You have to labor on all these points, and you have to pray until you yourself get into these messages, making them your own messages
You will speak not my message but your message, and you will speak out from your being with much exercise of your spirit
We need to read all the verses cited in the Scripture reading above and be impressed with the main points of these verses
The plural pronouns us and our are used indicating that the very God who intended to create man was triune the Father the Son and the Spirit
The decision to create man was made by the Triune God, indicating that the creation of man was for the purpose of the Triune God
The Trinity of the Godhead is not for theological doctrine, but for the dispensing of God Himself into man according to His divine economy
Colossians 115 says that the beloved Son of God is the image of the invisible God and 2 Corinthians 44 says that Christ is the image of God
God decided in His Godhead to create man in His image, and the image of God according to the Bible is just Christ
God can think God can consider God can love God can like and dislike God can make choices God can have intentions and God can make decisions
After God formed man with the dust of the earth to give him a physical body, God breathed the breath of life into the nostrils of man
It is clear that the man created by God has two organs: the body formed with dust and the spirit that came from the breath of life
We need to point out that the breath of life breathed into man at his creation should not be considered as something of God's eternal life
The breath of life was not the eternal life because Gods intention was that man would exercise his own free will to choose Gods eternal life
According to His divine principle, God would let man exercise his own free will to choose God and take God as his life
After Christ's death and resurrection, man could believe in the Lord Jesus and receive Him as the eternal life
Genesis 2:7 says that when the breath of life was breathed into the nostrils of the body of man, man became a living soul
God used two kinds of materials the dust for making man's body and the breath of life for producing man's spirit
It is clear that man was made in three parts: the outward body, the inward spirit, and the soul as the very being of man
We have to see that at the very beginning God had no intention to ask man to keep any law to do anything good or to bear any kind of burden
The Potter made the clay vessels, and He made us vessels of mercy, vessels unto honor, and even vessels unto glory
Our being vessels to contain God is not because we are so good and preferable to God; it is altogether a matter of God's mercy
Eventually, we all will be filled with God's glory and glorified in the glory of God to become the vessels unto glory
We must stress this one point in this message that man was made a vessel with a human spirit as a receptacle to receive God
The thought of man being a vessel of God is not with them, because there is not such a thought in our human mentality
Unless man can be a vessel, a container to contain God and to be filled up with God, man can never be used by God to fulfill His purpose
In Romans 9:21 and 23 Paul told us that God's creation of man was just to produce, to create, man as a vessel to fulfill God's purpose
The apostle Paul considered himself as an earthen vessel to contain a treasure, and the treasure is just Christ, the very God
In Romans 9 and 2 Corinthians 4 we can see a clear revelation that man was created by God to be His vessel to contain Him
Genesis 27 shows us that man has an outward body made with dust and an inward receptacle an inward receiver produced by Gods breath of life
Many Bible readers mistakenly think that the breath of life breathed into the nostrils of the dusty man was the life of God
When the Lord Jesus breathed the Spirit of God into the disciples, the eternal life entered into the disciples
When God breathed the breath of life into the dusty body of man, that breath of life became man's human spirit
Two principles do not allow us to say that God's life entered into man at his creation when God's breath of life was breathed into him
If God had put His eternal life into man at his creation, there would have been no need for man to exercise his free will
Some wrongly say that man received the life of God at his creation based upon Luke 3:38, which says that Adam was the son of God
Adam was considered the son of God because he was created by God even as the heathen poets considered all mankind to be the offspring of God
Although man did not receive God's life at his creation, he was created with a human spirit, which came from God's breath of life
Although the human spirit is not the Spirit of God or the divine life of God, it is very close to the Spirit of God
John 4:24, which says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit, proves that our spirit is able to contact God
The Bible shows that in our psychological being, besides the mind as the understanding organ, there is also the emotion as the loving organ
The two trees show that in this universe there are two wills, two sources, and two possibilities for man to choose
After God put man in front of two choices, God warned man not to choose the wrong tree and charged him to eat the right tree
God's prohibiting man from eating the tree of knowledge indicates that God wanted man to receive Him as life by enjoying Him
You cannot say that you have eaten the best food and that you have eaten more than enough, so you do not need to eat anymore
If a person would give you himself, his presence, instead of a road map, you could never be independent from him
Abraham exercised his faith to trust in God for His instant leading, taking God's presence as the map for his traveling
Some people may come to the church, learn something, and then want to go away to do something, using what they have learned
The tree of life issues in a principle of dependence, and the tree of knowledge issues in a principle of independence
When the Lord Jesus came, He said, 'I am the bread of life' , and 'he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
The tree of life is seen in Genesis 2 at the beginning of the Bible and in Revelation 2 and 22 at the end of the Bible
In Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus promised the church in Ephesus that to the one who overcomes He would give to eat of the tree of life
The last promise in the entire Bible is a promise of the enjoyment of the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of life
God did not say anything to Adam regarding the tree of life, but God did say something regarding the tree of knowledge
God's warning to man concerning not eating the tree of knowledge indicates three things: God's greatness, God's love, and God's desire
Question: What is the best way to show that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents Satan's life?
The tree of life and the tree of knowledge actually are the two controlling lines through the sixty-six books of the Bible
In the families, in the nations, and even in the churches, God is here as the tree of life, and Satan is here as the tree of knowledge
We all need to live a dependent life of the tree of life and turn away from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
In Matthew 13:28 the word enemy is used, but we have to realize that Satan is not only God's enemy but also God's adversary
Because Satan was hiding himself in the serpent, eventually his name is called the ancient serpent in Revelation 12:9
Satan acted first to enter into man earlier than God in an attempt to prevent God from carrying out His desire with man
John 11 tells us that when the Lord heard that Lazarus was sick, He remained in the place where He was for two days
The mind was poisoned, the emotion was poisoned, and the will was poisoned; thus, the entire soul was contaminated
When Eve and Adam took the fruit of the tree of knowledge, Satan entered into the human body to be the evil in man's flesh
When sin is dormant within us, it is merely sin, but when it is aroused in us by our willing to do the good, it becomes 'the evil'
Timothy 2:14 says, 'And Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression'
Today mankind is in the hand of Satan, and Satan uses the whole human race to do his will, to frustrate God from fulfilling God's purpose
We have to pray so that we can have the best utterance to present these things to the new ones and to the young ones
Adam forsook the tree of life, which denotes God as life, to pursue the tree of knowledge, which signifies Satan as the source of death
Man's fall spoiled man from fulfilling God's purpose, which is to express God in His image and represent God with His dominion
Genesis 3:6 says that Eve ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge, gave it to Adam, her husband, and he also ate of it
God created man with a pure body, but something of Satan was received into man's body and man's body changed in nature
Romans 7 especially in verses 8 11 17 and 20 indicates that sin is a person the embodiment of Satan and is living and acting within us
Through the fall, man's being, man's personality, man's soul, has been filled with Satan's being, with Satan's personality
The deadness of our spirit pervaded our entire being and caused us to lose the function that enabled us to contact God
Through the fall, man's soul became one with Satan's person, man's body became Satan's dwelling place, and man's spirit was deadened
The real significance of man's fall is that Satan was taken into man, sin entered into man, and man became a victim of death
It is not just man transgressing against God, not just man falling under God's condemnation, but man receiving Satan into himself
Satan's being entered into man's being, and Satan himself as sin entered into man's body, making man's body the flesh
It is not just a matter of man transgressing against God and falling under God's condemnation, but a matter of man taking in something
If the mother leaves home and the child takes in that poison, this is not merely a transgression against the mother's commandment
When God comes in to save us, He does not just take care of our transgression and of our being under His condemnation
Focus: God's salvation is not only by the death of Christ but also by His life to save us from both sin and death
Satan brought man into death through sin and today Satan keeps all men in sins that death may continue to work in man and on man
Man's mind wants to do good, but if man's mind is set on the flesh, on the corrupted body, man's mind also becomes death
We need to stress the verse references above from John's writings to show that the Son of God came as life that we may have life
John 12:24 speaks of Christ as the one grain of wheat who died to release His life to produce us as the many grains
Timothy 1:10 says that the Son of God has brought life to light; this means that He has released life and has manifested life
After Christ released the life within Him through His death, He imparted His life in resurrection to God's chosen people
Finally, in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit so that He may impart Himself as life into us, enter into us, and live within us
Romans 5:10 says that after we have been saved by being made alive, God is still saving us by the life of Christ
We need to be those who eat the bread of life, drink the water of life, and live by the Son of God as our life
Some nuns and priests in the Catholic Church may be very devotional, but that is merely their kind of pious exercise
Confucius said that we need to develop the 'bright virtue' within us, which is actually the development of our conscience
The teachings of Confucius are to help develop man's good nature, the natural, good virtues created by God within man
You may accumulate a lot of biblical knowledge by reading books or by studying in a seminary and yet not know life at all
The real life is immortal and eternal, and this real life is God Himself because God is from eternity to eternity
We need to pay attention to the focus of this message: life is the Triune God dispensed into us and living in us
Focus: To be regenerated is to have the life of God that we may be His children living in His kingdom according to the divine nature
AustinSparks which said that to be born again is to receive another life the eternal and uncreated life of God in addition to our human life
We need to be impressed that through regeneration, we receive the divine life in addition to our natural, human life
Regeneration is not a matter of considering that all things in the past are dead and that everything is new today
In regeneration, we receive another life which is the eternal life, the uncreated life, the divine life, that is, the life of God
Some Christian teachers would say that to be born again is just to have a new beginning, a new day in your human life
It is not a birth of the natural life, of the human life; it is the birth of the divine life, of the eternal life, the life of God
An apple tree cannot express the life and nature of a peach tree, because it does not have the peach life and nature
Genesis 2 indicates clearly that this sinless man, perfect man, good man, and pure man, still needed the life of God
If you do not have that kind of life, you can never get into that kingdom, that realm, or really understand what is within that realm
In order to be regenerated, we need to realize that our natural being needs to be buried in the water of baptism
When the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus that He needed to be born again, Nicodemus asked, 'How can a man be born when he is old?
Before he came to the Lord, the Pharisees heard John the Baptist tell them, 'I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He
Water' refers to the water of baptism, the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, the ministry of repentance
John's ministry of repentance was to put people into the water, to bury people, to terminate people of the old creation
We not only need to realize that we need the life of God, but we also need to realize that our natural being should be terminated
We are reborn, not of earthly parents but of the Spirit of God, not in our body or in our soul but in our spirit
Regeneration is accomplished in the human spirit by the Holy Spirit with God's life, the uncreated, eternal life
Since we are born of God, spontaneously we are born into the realm of God, into the sphere of God, that is, into the kingdom of God
In this lesson we want to see the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit spoken of in Titus 3:5
The only other place the word is used is in Matthew 19:28, where it is used for the restoration in the millennium
These old things of our natural life are purged away by the washing, the laver, of a changed position and of a new state of things
If a person swallowed a pearl, it would enter into his being in an inorganic way because the pearl does not possess any element of life
The food gets into his being as his life supply in an organic way, and it even becomes the constituents of the tissues of his physical being
The washing of regeneration, of the changed position and new state of things, is also absolutely in life and with life
We can testify that when we were born again, we began to love God and we longed to receive God by contacting Him in our spirit
The renewing of the Holy Spirit is not just to reconstitute our being on the positive side but also to transform us
Ezekiel 36:27a says that besides giving us a new heart and putting in us a new spirit God also put His own Spirit into our being
Romans 8:9 and 11 show that the Spirit of God dwells in us to saturate our being with divine, resurrection life
The indwelling Spirit of God renews us day by day unto the full knowledge of God according to what God is, according to the image of God
The renewing work of the Holy Spirit is making all of us a part of the renewed new man that the new man may resemble God in full
Communion is a good translation, but its true meaning has been somewhat spoiled by traditional thought and usage
In Philippians 2:1 Paul speaks of encouragement in Christ, consolation of love, fellowship of spirit, and tenderheartedness and compassions
In John 15:4-5 the word fellowship is not mentioned, but we know that these verses in fact refer to the fellowship
We share the Lord's Body in common, and we share the cup in common, so the Body and the cup become our fellowship
John 1 says that we first have fellowship with the Father and the Son; then we have this fellowship with one another
If our fellowship is wrong vertically with the Father and the Son, we cannot have the fellowship horizontally with one another
In this vertical and horizontal fellowship, there is the mingling of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit with all the saints
In other words, the fellowship eventually consummates in the oneness of the Triune God with the Body of Christ
Many in Christianity think that fellowship is a kind of social contact in a social association with social activities
It is really hard for us in our experience to differentiate these three things: the fellowship, the life, and the Spirit
The tree of life indicates the supply that goes along with the flowing of the river of water of life, which is the fellowship of life
Many Christians believe the blood cleanses them but this cleansing is not practically applied to them because they are not in the fellowship
It says that when we are in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin
When our physical body has no illness, no problem, we do not have any feeling, but when we are ill, we are full of feeling
To realize the fellowship of life and to safeguard, keep, and preserve the fellowship of life are all by the sense of life
John 1:9 says that if we confess our sins, God is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
He forgives us according to His word faithfully and also according to the redemptive work of Christ righteously
These are some of the most precious verses in the New Testament, and they all have something to do with the sense of life
We have to realize Romans 8:6 is altogether a verse of sensation because it says the mind set on the flesh is death
The feeling of death is the inner feeling of weakness, emptiness, uneasiness, restlessness, depression, dryness, darkness, pain, etc
When you sense that you are weak empty uneasy restless depressed dried up darkened and in pain within this indicates that death is there
The feeling of death and the feeling of life and peace are the two aspects of the meaning of the sense of life
On both the negative side and the positive side, the sense of life is always related to the consciousness of the conscience
According to Ephesians 4:18-19, the unbelievers are past feeling because they are alienated from the life of God
Because this life-law functions within us, it surely gives us a certain kind of sensation, so it is an aspect of the source of life
Romans 8:2 speaks of the law of the Spirit of life, and Hebrews 8:10 says that this law is inscribed on our hearts
The Spirit anoints us continuously, and His anointing is a kind of inner working and moving which gives us the sense of life
The teaching of Confucius is altogether centered on the developing of the conscience, which is referred to by him as the 'bright virtue'
His ethical teachings and the positive teachings of the good philosophers are focused on the development of the human conscience
The development of the goodness within a person is the development of his conscience, which was created by God
The unbelievers have the human conscience, but we believers have not only a created conscience but also a renewed conscience
They do not care for this inner sense of life functioning to make us know whether we are living in the natural life or in the divine life
If we do not have the positive sensations of strength, satisfaction, peace, rest, release, liveliness, watering, brightness, comfort, etc
, we must realize that we are not living in the divine life; it must be that we are living in the natural life
The function of the sense of life is also to make us know whether we are living in the natural life or in the divine life
Now that we have seen something concerning the sense of life, we need to go on to see the dispensing function of the Triune God
The teaching of the Seventh-day Adventists is similar in the sense that their teaching is nearly altogether according to the Old Testament
We need to be fully transferred out of all mixture into the pure New Testament revelation of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
Verse 10 continues, 'But if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, the spirit is life because of righteousness'
The entire Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit function together to dispense Himself as life into our being
Eventually, even the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of God, God Himself, dwells in us to spread His life, to give His life, to our mortal body
To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts'
The Father receives and answers the prayer, the Spirit strengthens, and then Christ makes His home in our hearts
When Christ makes His home in our hearts that means our whole being will be taken over possessed occupied and filled up with the Triune God
In other words, whatever the Father is, has, and does is altogether embodied in this universal organism, the vine
John 15, Romans 8, and Ephesians 3 are crucial portions of the Word concerning the dispensing function of the Triune God
In John 14 you have these two main points: first, the Father is embodied in the Son, and second, the Son is realized as the Spirit
John 14:23 says, 'If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
The law of life and the anointing both issue in the sense of life and are both a part of the dispensing function of the Triune God
John 15:1b says that He is the husbandman, the source, and in Ephesians 3:14-16 the apostle Paul prays to the Father as the source
In John 15:1a, the Son said, 'I am the true vine,' and in John 14:11 He said that He is in the Father and the Father is in Him
In our speaking to the saints, we need to develop the Lord's words in John 14:17-20, which reveal the Spirit as the reality of the Son
The indwelling Triune God dispenses life to our whole being, and this dispensing reaches even to our circumference, our body
Again, this is the functioning of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit to dispense Himself into our being
The sense of life is the issue of the Triune God functioning within us to dispense Himself as life into our whole being
The issue of the sense of life by the dispensing function of the Triune God is by the teaching of the anointing
The sense of life is through the law of life by the teaching of the anointing and in our spirit which is mingled with the lifegiving Spirit
We need to read these verses to the saints to show them that the Triune God is dispensed into the three parts of man
When we enter into eternity, we will be freed from so many limitations, and then we will realize what it means to be in Christ Jesus
He is the One who has divinity and humanity, who has passed through so many processes, and who has accomplished so much
We may read Romans 810 which says that our spirit is life but we understand that either life is in our spirit or that our spirit is living
In Romans 8 every word, every phrase, every clause, and every sentence should have been thoroughly considered by Paul
Because our mind is set upon the spirit, our spirit saturates our mind and makes our mind a mind of the spirit
Because our mind is one with our spirit, connected, joined, saturated, and infused with our spirit, our mind is also life
When our mind is joined to our spirit and is saturated with our spirit that is life, our mind at this time also becomes life
For this point we have to say that the mind set on the spirit means the mind is joined to the spirit and is relying on the spirit
Romans 7 shows us that a saved person seeking to serve God uses his natural mind to keep the law and is defeated
When our mind is really married to our spirit set upon our spirit relying upon our spirit to be one with our spirit such a mind becomes life
Without the Spirit indwelling us, life cannot be dispensed from the center of our being to the circumference of our being
If we would exercise our spirit to pray and contact the Lord, this will allow the indwelling Spirit to move in us
Spontaneously the divine life will be dispensed into our weakened body, and our weakened body will be vitalized
In verses 8 through 10 four titles are interchangeably used: God, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ
God is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself
Eventually verse 11 says that the God who raised Christ Jesus from the dead gives life to our mortal body through the indwelling Spirit
Romans 8:9-11 gives us a full picture of the dispensing of the Triune God for the purpose of imparting Himself into us as the divine life
Within every genuine Christian there are three lives: the physical life, the psychological life, and the spiritual, divine life
Three different Greek words are used for these three lives: bios the physical life, psuche the soulish life, and zoe the spiritual life
What we are talking about in these lessons is zoe, which is the divine life, the eternal life, the life of God, becoming our spiritual life
We have to stress here that the life we are talking about is the content of the Spirit, and the Spirit belongs to this life
We have to point out that the feeling of peace is the inner feeling of ease, comfort, harmony, rest, joy, and liberty
By the consciousness of life the consciousness of the law the consciousness of peace and the consciousness of death we can sense the spirit
Now we want to talk about the consciousness of these four things and about how to know the spirit by the sense of the spirit
After we realize the consciousness of life, the law of life, peace, and death, we can know the spirit by the sense of the spirit
These two spirits have become one, so the divine life is the life of both of the two spirits, the Holy Spirit and our spirit
When we sense all the above items deep within, that is the sense of life, and this sense proves that we are walking according to the spirit
The life in our spirit is God Himself, and our spirit with the divine life contained in the Holy Spirit is the new man
When we walk and live by the divine life in our new man, we have the sense of peace, feeling natural, restful, comfortable, and at ease
When we have the inner sense of peace with the feeling of comfort, harmony, rest, joy, and liberty, we know that we are living in the spirit
In Genesis 2 this title is used especially when it mentions that God created a spirit in man by breathing the breath of life into man
Some Bible teachers wrongly consider that this breath of life is something directly of God's life and of God's Spirit
The material for the creation of man's spirit, the breath of life, is very close to the life of God and to the Spirit of God
Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him
No one can deny that these three items the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man are crucial in God's creation to fulfill His purpose
Romans 91 says that our conscience bears witness with us in the Holy Spirit whereas 816 says that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit
Other verses we can use to show the function of the conscience as a part of the spirit are Psalm 34:18 and Deuteronomy 2:30
Mark 2:8, Mark 8:12, and John 11:33 are other verses which show that the intuition is a part of the human spirit
These verses show that in the human spirit, there is a direct sense of discernment to know God and the spiritual things
The deadness of man's spirit, which pervaded his entire being, caused him to lose the function that enabled him to contact God
Galatians 5:16 and 25b charge us to walk by the Spirit, and Romans 8:4 says that we need to walk according to the spirit
Now that we have seen something concerning the human spirit, we need to go on to see the exercise of our spirit
The second point we have to stress is that this lamp of God, which is our spirit, searches all our inward parts
Proverbs 20:27 can be used to impress the saints so that they can see how man's spirit is so close to God and is something of God within man
Our physical body is our outward man, our soul is our expressed, manifested man, and our spirit is our hidden man
According to 1 Peter 3, the most beautiful part of our being, the prettiest adornment, in the sight of God is a meek and quiet spirit
Verse 5 says that God stirred up the spirit of a remnant of Israelites to go up to build His house in Jerusalem
Romans 12:11 charges us to be burning in spirit, and Acts 18:25 tells us that Apollos was fervent, burning, in spirt
In the past we prayed many times without exercising our spirit, but Ephesians 6:18 says that we need to pray at every time in our spirit
Of course, this is a negative example, because when one loses his temper his spirit comes forth in a cruel and rude way
Many socalled Christian services have singing the reading of the Bible a sermon and a benediction all without the exercise of the spirit
When we come together to meet, before singing, before praying, before reading, before doing anything, all of us should exercise our spirit
Our spirit needs to worship God directly apart from merely depending upon singing, reading, or praying in a formal way
These two verses, no doubt, are describing the enjoyment of the Lord, and in the enjoyment of the Lord, our spirit has to take the lead
A person may come to us and speak something to us, but if we merely understand him with our mind according to his word, we will be cheated
Strictly speaking the word exercise in the sense of the exercise of our spirit for godliness is used in the New Testament only in 1 Timothy
We should not do things in ourselves either to participate in God's blessing or to accomplish something for God's purpose
Our not doing anything means that we should not do anything by our flesh, by ourselves, or by our natural life
In the dispensary, drugs are dispensed into lifeless bottles, and because they are lifeless, their cooperation is not required
In order to usher all the saints into the proper exercise of our spirit, we have to point out all these basic points
Godliness is a Christian life, a godly life, that expresses God as the issue of God's dispensing, and this is a mystery
The promise of the present life a life that is in this age is like the promises in Matthew 633 John 1633 Philippians 467 1 Peter 5810 etc
The present life does not mean our physical life, because the word here is zoe, referring to the divine, uncreated life of God
Paul told Timothy, 'But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness'
Paul said that in the degradation of the church, some only have the outward form of godliness, but they do not have the power
Some religious people may have ordinances about how to dress in an outward form of godliness, but there is no inward power with them
Our heart must be purified and the heart includes all these things motive intention purpose will decision sensation feeling and thought
In his repentance he prayed that the Lord would let him have an upright spirit, a constant, firm, steady spirit
What the Lord wants, what the Lord desires, what the Lord asks of us, we will have a willing spirit to answer, to obey
If you consider that you are perfect and complete, you would not repent or confess your weaknesses and your failures
In our words, our attitude, our thoughts, our feelings, and our talk with others, many times we are wrong, even unconsciously
In 1 Corinthians 4:21 Paul asked the Corinthians if they wanted him to come to them with a rod or in a spirit of meekness
We always need to be poor in our spirit, not letting our spirit be preoccupied, filled up, with things other than the Lord Himself
We should consider not only our outward ways, our outward behavior, and our outward attitude but also our inward spirit
To discern the spirit means not only to realize the difference between the spirit and the soul but also to divide the spirit from the soul
All the saints, including the older ones, need to understand why Paul mentioned the word of God for the dividing of our spirit from our soul
Hebrews 4:12 is mentioned based upon the fact that God spoke to the children of Israel, charging them to go on directly into the good land
Paul spoke the word of God to them to expose their inner situation and to help them to discern that they were in the soul not in the spirit
By this we can see that every time we read the word in the Bible in a living way, the word always either requires or demands something of us
If we walk according to our mind emotion and will this means we walk according to our soul according to our self not according to the spirit
If we do not know how to discern the spirit from the soul, this means that we do not allow the soul to be broken and the self to be denied
It is not until we have the soul broken, the self denied, that we have the clear ground to set our mind on the spirit
We can walk according to the spirit and we can be one with the Lord in such a spirit, a spirit fully discerned from the soul
