   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PATHWAY TO GLORY THROUGH JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Luke 9:28-31</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word we should pay attention to in this passage is "Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I will clarify a few things first, and then I will come back to this.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible records that God spoke to the Lord Jesus from the heavens three times.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first time was when the Lord Jesus rose up from baptism Matt 3:16-17 ; the second time was on the mount of transfiguration Luke 9:28-35 , and the third time was after the Lord said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone" John 12:24-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is one reason why God spoke to the Lord Jesus these three times: He purposely chose the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not choose a way better than the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His baptism was a choice of the cross, a choice of death and burial.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the mount of transfiguration, He also chose the cross; He did not ascend to heaven from there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He entered Jerusalem and a few Greeks requested to see Him, it was the most glorious moment of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But He still chose the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not choose to be a king as the result of men's adulation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In today's passage, we see how the Lord chose the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people say that the mount of transfiguration is a type of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the Lord Jesus said that the mount of transfiguration was the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Luke 9:27 He said clearly, "But I say to you truly, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The kingdom of God descended to the earth for a moment, and the Lord Jesus manifested His glory in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord could have ascended to heaven from there, but He was discussing all the things related to the fact of what "He was about to complete in Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He purposely chose the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Two men, Moses and Elijah, were talking with Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Elijah represents those who will be raptured, whereas Moses represents those who will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time, the Lord Jesus was standing at the place of the rapture and the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, He had a clear view and a clear vision that the pathway to glory was not the mount of transfiguration, but another way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before He came to the mount of transfiguration, the pathway was not so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although it had been decided before the foundation of the world, the pathway became clear after the conversation on the mount of transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The pathway had to pass through Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From this point on, we see the Lord descending from the mountain and heading toward Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem" Luke 9:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"And He journeyed...making His way toward Jerusalem" 13:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"In the same hour some Pharisees came up, saying to Him, Get out and go from here, for Herod wants to kill you" v. 31 . They were suggesting that the Lord change His course.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Lord answered saying, "I must journey today and tomorrow and on the following day because it is not acceptable for a prophet to perish outside of Jerusalem" v. 33 . He headed straight toward Jerusalem and would not turn at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Luke 17:11 says, "And as He was going to Jerusalem..."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He did not change His course.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Luke 18:31 says, "Behold we are going up to Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Luke 19:11 says, "He was near Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 28 says, "And having said these things, He went on before them, going up to Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 37 says, "And as He was already drawing near..."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 41 says, "And as He drew near..."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 45 says, "And He entered into the temple."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows us that the Lord approached Jerusalem step by step!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From Luke 9 to 23, we see a line that leads to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This course was set on the mount of transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Was the Lord's heart for Jerusalem itself?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, it was not for Jerusalem but for what would be accomplished in Jerusalem, which was the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jerusalem means the accomplishment of God's will, which is the bearing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the mount of transfiguration, glory purposely descended to the world, and the Lord Jesus was enveloped in this glory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In that vision the Lord Jesus clearly saw that the way to glory was through Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His face was set toward Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Isaiah said that He set His face like a flint Isa 50:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He faced Jerusalem with a stone-like face; there was no change in Him; He went straight from the mountain to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why should we pay attention to this matter today?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is because the day of the rapture is near!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The day when the Lord will rapture the saints is near!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are not speaking about who will or will not be raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are saying that if a person wants to be raptured, he has to go to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that we have to bear the cross; we have to take this pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God has shown us the glory, the rapture, and the resurrection, we have to obey His will and bear the cross, taking up the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Please remember that even though the Lord Jesus knew that the time of His being taken up was at hand, He did not wait passively for the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible says, "And as the days were being fulfilled for Him to be taken up, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem" Luke 9:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The cross came before the rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we know that the day is near, we should also set our mind to obey God's will concerning us, which is to bear the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The meaning of going up to Jerusalem is nothing other than bearing the cross, which accomplishes God's will.</S>
