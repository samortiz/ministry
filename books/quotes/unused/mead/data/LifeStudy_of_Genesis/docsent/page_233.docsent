   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Rebellion of the Human Race</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The second factor of the cause of the fourth fall was the rebellion of the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The whole human race rebelled collectively against God's right and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we have seen, the issue was a matter of who would have the right in this universe, of who would have authority on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The entire human race was stirred up, having been instigated into rebellion, to declare that they did not care for God's right or for God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>1 Man Not Using the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the first fall man did not use his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you read Genesis 3, you will see that Adam and Eve had probably forgotten about their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not use it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 Man Acting by the Soul</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the second fall man acted by his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you read the story of Cain in Genesis 4, you will see that he was a man who was one hundred percent in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was absolutely outside of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3 Man Walking according to the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the third fall man walked according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Can you see these three steps?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Firstly, man neglected the spirit; secondly, he acted by the soul; and thirdly, he lived and walked absolutely according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So by the time of Genesis 6 man had become flesh 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God could no longer tolerate this fallen flesh and He sent the flood as His judgment upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>4 The Whole Human Being</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rising Up Collectively to Rebel against God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the fourth fall man rose up collectively to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His whole being was stirred up by Satan to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you consider your experience, you will find these four things within yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes we do not use our spirit and sometimes we go by the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At other times we are much worse, behaving ourselves according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At other times the situation is even worse, for deep within us we may say, "I don't care for God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I believe that we have all said this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we have not said it many times, at least we have said it a few times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not believe that there is anyone who has never said this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we might not have spoken these words outwardly, deep within we have said, "I don't care for God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is too troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am a free person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I don't want to be bothered by God."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even after coming into the church life, there is still within you this sort of satanic instigation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the work of Satan to build up Babel in your being once again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whenever you say that you do not care for God, it means that you intend to build a city and a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is rebellion, the rebellion that comes from Satan's instigation.</S>
