   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE FELLOWSHIP UNTO THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Luke 16:9-11; 1 Tim 6:17-19; 3 John 5-8; Phil 1:5, 6; 4:15-19 PLUNDERING EGYPT OF ITS GOLD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will consider more concerning the full-timers who would still remain in their job, their profession or business, to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those full-timers remain there to make a gain of the world s gold.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Israelites left Egypt, they plundered it of its gold Exo 11:2-3; 12:35-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The material gold mine is in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need some full-timers to remain there to dig the gold mine to get the gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The other full-timers will drop their job, profession, or business for the preaching and teaching of the gospel truth, but they will need something to live on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We would not like to see that they would be forced to make tents as Paul was in Acts 18:1-3.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That would be a shame to us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I were there at Paul s time, I would have gone through all the churches to tell them that it was a shame that they would not have fellowship with the Apostle Paul unto the gospel Phil 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was a shame to force him and his co-workers to go back to Egypt to get some gold.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must stress to the saints that we are all full-timers in different functions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some have the function to preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life to all the seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, these dear ones could not have any time to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They need others to support them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, a great number of us full-timers should remain in our jobs, professions, or businesses to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a great thing to have fellowship unto the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unto the gospel means for the furtherance of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the full-timers who remain in their jobs and businesses need to have this kind of fellowship, a fellowship for the furtherance of the Lord s move through those who do not remain in businesses and jobs, but who are occupied all day with preaching and teaching for the spreading of the Lord s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not sufficient to use the Seventh-Day Adventists as an example, reminding the saints how they practice ten percent tithing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is too poor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The tithing of ten percent to the Lord is altogether an Old Testament thing, belonging to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There was no grace, life, or life power in that.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must be different.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are in the age of grace, which provides us with much supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The dynamic salvation was accepted by Zaccheus in Luke 19:1-10.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately after being saved, that sinner gave up so much of his worldly possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That was not a tithing of ten percent; that was the very issue of the dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Likewise, on the day of Pentecost all those small members had everything in common Acts 2:44, 45; 4:32-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was not one tenth of their possessions but one hundred percent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They put everything at the feet of the apostles, that is, at the Lord s disposal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That was wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are in the Lord s recovery; even this matter has to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have passed beyond all earthly bribe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the riches could never bribe us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We would not accept any kind of bribe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is rotten.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Any government which receives a bribe is a rotten, ruined government.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We would not be ruined; therefore, we have to pass far, far beyond all earthly bribes to God s complete purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Luke 16:1-13 the Lord Jesus teaches us how to be wise, as the unrighteous steward.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Israelites required gold of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Apparently that was not righteous, but in a sense that was very righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Egyptians had robbed Israel for over two hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Israelites had no chance to plunder the Egyptians in turn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now, God s sovereignty subdued Pharaoh, and Pharaoh could do nothing to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God gave His people the chance to plunder them, the more the better, as much as they could.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This was altogether righteous because He is a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now we are making a gain of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you think that this is not righteous?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is very righteous because the world has been robbing God our Father for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From where did they get their riches?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was from God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, God sends us back to make a gain of them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, we do not rob them, but we make a gain of the world s riches by our labor, laboring day and night to be very successful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the people of the world can establish a factory which earns ten million dollars, we had better go today to earn fifty million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Go back to tell the saints to make a gain of the world in the righteous way, to make more money the more the better.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, try your best when you get riches, not to retain one penny.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you would not retain even a penny, you must say to the Devil, I mean business with my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I only use a little part for me and for my family to live on in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I do not like to see the saints living in a poor way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Neither do I like to see the saints living in a luxurious way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I like to see that the saints have proper homes, and that they put their children in schools, helping them to get the highest degree, if possible, a Ph.D. On occasion I have given money to some of the saints to support their children s education.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I like to see as well that all the saints have proper cars, but not too expensive, that they may have a good living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must save every penny that we can.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But we save not for our savings account, but to have something for His spending.</S>
