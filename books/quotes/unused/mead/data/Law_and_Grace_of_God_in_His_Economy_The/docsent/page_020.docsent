   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This One who was in resurrection also entered into ascension and became the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is typified by the holy anointing oil in Exodus 30:22-25.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The holy anointing oil is the fragrant olive oil compounded with four kinds of spices.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not merely oil but an ointment with various elements.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a type of the compound Spirit, in whom are the Father and the Son with His all-inclusive death, His human living, His resurrection, and His ascension.</S>
