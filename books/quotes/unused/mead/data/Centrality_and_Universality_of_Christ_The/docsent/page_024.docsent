   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now as Christians, we need to check and see where we are today.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Are we in the outer court, in the Holy Place, or in the Holy of Holies?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are we in Egypt, in the wilderness, or in the good land?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are we in the flesh, in the soul, or in the spirit where Christ is and which is the Holy of Holies to Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, you may say you are in Egypt, in the outer court, or in the fleshly body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second, you may say you are in the wilderness, in the Holy Place, or in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Third, you may say you are in the good land of Canaan, in the Holy of Holies, or in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Are you in the first part, second part, or third part?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some may say they are in the second part.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be in the second part is to be neutral, lukewarm.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are neutral, or lukewarm, you are neither cold nor hot, and the Lord will spew you out Rev 3:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Look at the history of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They displeased the Lord simply by wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to see that the goal set before us by the Lord is the Holy of Holies, that is, the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit is the innermost part of a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is where Christ is today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the Holy of Holies to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Also, to be in our spirit is to be in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our spirit is Christ's Spirit, so this good land is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hebrews 10:19 says that we have the boldness for entering the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are told, encouraged, and charged to have the boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some Christian teachers say that the Holy of Holies is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the one hand, I admit that the Holy of Holies today is in heaven, where the Lord Jesus is Heb 9:12, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, if the Holy of Holies were only in heaven, how could we enter into it while we are on earth today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the one hand, the Holy of Holies is in heaven, but on the other hand, it is in our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The very Christ who is in heaven is now also in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the heavenly ladder Gen 28:12; John 1:51 , He joins our spirit to heaven and brings heaven into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, heaven today is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our regenerated spirit, our recovered spirit, our cleansed spirit, is the Holy of Holies today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, it is easy for us to enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wherever we are, there the Holy of Holies is, because it is the innermost part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem is that many of us do not know where our spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once I was living in a house for many months, yet I was not aware that there was a secret room in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, many of us have been Christians for years, yet we have not discovered that there is a secret chamber within us which is the Holy of Holies, where Christ is today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That secret chamber is our human spirit, where Christ, the living One, the life-giving Spirit, the freeing Spirit, the transforming Spirit, the wonderful Spirit, dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to realize this.</S>
