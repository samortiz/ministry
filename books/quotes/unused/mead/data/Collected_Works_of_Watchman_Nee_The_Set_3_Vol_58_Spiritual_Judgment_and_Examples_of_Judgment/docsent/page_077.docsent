   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 56 Date:September 9, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER K. B.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In my youth I always pondered the meaning of the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I searched through Chinese traditions and ethical teachings, but I did not find any answer or profit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Later I turned to the pursuit of temporal recognition and wealth for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I decided to join the army.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Twice I had close encounters with bombs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I began to realize the vanity of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day in 1937 a friend of mine invited me to a gospel meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I had been a mocker up to that point, and I had criticized pastors for not practicing what they preached.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I went along with my friend and attended the meeting, but I did not try to listen to the message.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead, I was checking out the stories and snooping around.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second day I went, I was moved by the sincerity of the preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third night I went again, and the Lord worked on me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I saw my own evil, and I saw that the Lord Jesus had died on the cross for me, a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believed in Him and accepted Him as my personal Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I recalled the two incidents in the army when I was bombed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I had died then, I would not have been able to sit here today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank the Lord that I am still alive and that I can still believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After I accepted the Lord, I began to testify for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, my father also accepted the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The most painful thing was seeing my mother pass away without having a chance to accept the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was a traditional Chinese doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After I became a Christian, I still desired to build up a career.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I became successful, but this success turned me away from spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At one point in my life, I became very bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord began to deal with my business.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I obeyed the Lord and prostrated myself before Him in confession.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Outwardly, it was a bitter experience, but inwardly, it was a time of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I recovered my intimate fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that time on, everything else became a secondary profession; my primary profession was to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I began to serve Him earnestly in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At first my messages were mostly borrowed from reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I sought for the Lord's light but did not receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This bothered me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later I decided it was simpler to invite evangelists to come and conduct meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet inwardly I felt that something was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was like giving people a stimulant; it only revived them for a little while.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In January 1948 I received an invitation from a brother to attend a meeting by Brother Witness Lee.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I first thought it was just another revival meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, after listening to the message, I realized that I had heard something that I had never heard before.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I became very hungry within.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Later I learned that Brother Nee was giving conferences and talking about the truth of handing oneself over.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At the beginning I had reservations, but later I realized that it was only right for me to break my alabaster flask.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am willing to commit my ways to the Lord from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I am a quick person, both at heart and in my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I like to criticize and judge others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now I truly realize that this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Concerning our brother I would like to point out one thing in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are two ways to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We can say that there are two types of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First, there are those who try to control their outward conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some are very successful in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They learn to bridle their outward conduct by their will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Through their own cultivation, they are able to act calmly, humbly, and politely.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Second, there are those who have learned inward control through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This control also restricts a person, but not by means of the will like the first kind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the first case, a person observes others speaking with a certain tone of voice or acting quickly, slowly, or calmly, and he tries to imitate this in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This outward imitation is not the outflow of inward activity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A person may think that he is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Actually, he is only acting in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He may say that he has a certain degree of humility, but even he himself does not know his real self.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He cannot put his finger on the things he has acquired through imitation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>At the most he has borrowed others' conduct to change his own acts.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Other than this, he knows nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a very dangerous course for one to take in the spiritual pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These ones are like crows with many white feathers glued to them; even they themselves do not know what kind of bird they are.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's children should live their Christian life before God; they should not simply borrow a set of behaviors from others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Instead, they should learn the proper, inward lessons themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only these ones will have the proper growth.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who will not give up their outward restrictions and outward godliness will not advance; they will not grow in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When I was in London, I asked Brother Austin-Sparks concerning a certain missionary.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He told me that God only needs to destroy the part that is natural in a natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But if a natural man has acquired things in addition to his natural self, God first has to destroy the imitations which he has picked up.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many people have acquired many things that belong to others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They are actually adding materials to themselves that need to be broken down.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In order to break down the natural man of these ones, God must first break down the foreign elements that have been added to them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This adds to the breaking process, and it is foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>During the past two thousand years, everyone whom God used was unpretentious and spontaneous within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have the treasure, but it is in the earthen vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The outward vessel always remains impure.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is no need to embellish or paint it.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We do not treasure the outward earthen vessel; we treasure the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Many people only imitate the outward things; they have picked up nothing at all inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Our treasure is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We can be unpretentious because we have the treasure within us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In order for us to be unpretentious Christians, we have to start from the inside.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should not draw others' attention to the outward elements.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Instead, we should draw their attention to the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Our brother is quick in thoughts and words, but this is not the kind of Christian God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Our brother should not just learn outward lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He should allow the Lord to do a breaking work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You have to experience inward afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The outward innocence should not be given up, while the inward dealings should be deepened.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Then you will be able to express His life.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>I am not saying that our brother's attitude and words have to change.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I am saying that he needs the inward working of the Holy Spirit to change him from a "raw" state to a "cooked" state.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Being "raw" means to be innocent but with no maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Our brother has to seek to turn from "rawness" to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He has to touch God in an inward way, and then his rawness will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>On the one hand, you have to preserve your innocence.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>On the other hand, you have to experience the work of the Holy Spirit so that you will not lose your balance.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Once you are balanced in both aspects, your rawness will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>God does not destroy our innocence; rather, He dispenses the discipline of the Holy Spirit to us, which results in a deeper destruction of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The inward operation of the Holy Spirit always produces wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We should have ample experience of the Holy Spirit and allow His discipline to be added to our innocence.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Some people are still in the old creation; they need to be broken in many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>In Shanghai I once told a sister that if God had mercy on her, many of the things artificially "installed" in her would be dismantled.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Brother, you must experience the building-up process of the Holy Spirit within you.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In order for the self to be destroyed, all the foreign elements that have been added into you must be removed first.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Much time is needed for the inner being to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When your inward spiritual condition is strong enough, your outward innocence will be a complement to you and will render the Lord a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If your inward spiritual measure is too small, it will not match your outward innocence.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>If one has the discipline of the Holy Spirit, the release of the inward man will bear the outward innocence upon its wings.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Unless you have such an experience, you will only give others the impression of your rawness.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>God only needs to deal with the natural elements in an innocent man; He only needs to constitute His life into such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When the spirit of such a man is released, he will not lose his innocence.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is a beautiful picture.</S>
