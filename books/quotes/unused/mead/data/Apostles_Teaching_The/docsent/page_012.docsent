   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Its Section of the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in God s New Testament Economy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The kingdom of God has different sections.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One section, mentioned previously, is the kingdom of God in the Old Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom of God as the realm of God s governmental administration also has a particular section which is the kingdom of God in the New Testament age, that is, in God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The section in the New Testament is different from that in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The particular characteristic of the New Testament section is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom of God has a section of the divine life in God s New Testament economy Mark 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The divine life was only partially revealed in the Old Testament, but the divine life is a particular characteristic of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Genesis 2 the divine life was revealed in a symbolic way with the tree of life v. 9 . It was not revealed as definitely in the Old Testament as it is in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus said, I came that they may have life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Greek the word for life in this verse is zoe, referring to the eternal divine life, not psuche, referring to the soulish life, or bios, referring to the physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Colossians 3:4 Paul used the expression Christ our life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot find such a definite and clear expression in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 3:14-15 the Lord said, And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Again, the life referred to here is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The particular characteristic of the New Testament is this divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why in John 3 the Lord Jesus told us that if we desire to enter into the New Testament section of the kingdom of God, we must be reborn, or regenerated vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nicodemus was a leading teacher in Israel, yet he could not understand such a word spoken by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He misunderstood the Lord s word to mean that he had to return to his mother s womb and be born a second time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus told him that even if he could return to his mother s womb, he would still be the flesh, because that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit v. 6 . The flesh and the spirit are of two different realms and of two different natures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we desire to enter into the New Testament section of the kingdom of God, we must be born of the Spirit; we must have another life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every kingdom has its particular life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One cannot enter into a kingdom without having the life that matches that kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To enter the animal kingdom, we must have the animal life, and to enter the vegetable kingdom, we must have the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are not a lion, we could never be a part of the kingdom of the lions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we desire to understand the communication among the birds, we must be born into the kingdom of birds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The only way to be a part of a particular kingdom is to be born into that kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By our physical birth we were born into the kingdom of man, and by the divine birth we, as men, are born into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we have seen, a particular matter in the New Testament section of the kingdom of God is the divine life, the life of God, which is God Himself to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Old Testament, we could not see that God was life to Noah or to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But today, in the New Testament age, God is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, the realm of God s governmental administration has a section of the divine life in the New Testament economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mark 1:15 indicates that at the time the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, the kingdom of God had only drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, Matthew 21:43 indicates that the kingdom of God was already present with the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It seems that these two verses contradict each other.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, they refer to two sections of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus preached the gospel, saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This indicates that while the old section of the kingdom of God was in existence, a new section was about to begin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This new section is new in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the old section, the divine life had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, the very content of the new section of the kingdom of God is God s divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of the Seed of Life Sown by Christ</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The new section of the kingdom of God is of the seed of life sown by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Mark 4:3 says, The sower went out to sow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus was the Sower, and He sowed Himself as the seed of life into Peter, John, James, and all the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verses 26-27 of the same chapter we find, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth, and sleep and rise night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens how, he does not know.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The kingdom of God is like a seed that grows after it has been sown.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is something new.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Old Testament, there was no regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God was not a seed sown into His chosen people that this seed might grow in them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The word concerning the new section of the kingdom of God reveals that God came through incarnation to sow Himself as the seed of life into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The seed of life is the seed of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It grows up to be the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This does not refer to the old section of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the old section of the kingdom of God, God Himself was not there growing as the seed of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It was in the new section of the kingdom of God that God came to sow Himself as the seed of life into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hallelujah, God has been sown into us!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The kingdom of God in the new section is God Himself as the seed of life that is sown into us and grows to be the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The seed of life, which is God Himself, not only produces the kingdom of God; it grows to be the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Just as the kingdom of lions is the lions themselves, and the kingdom of vegetables is the vegetables themselves, so the kingdom of God is God Himself growing in us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We are part of the kingdom of God because God is in us growing as the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not walk according to God, we will not bear the appearance of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whenever we walk according to God, we bear the appearance of the kingdom of God.</S>
