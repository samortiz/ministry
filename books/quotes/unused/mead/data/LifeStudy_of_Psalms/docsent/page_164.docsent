   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF THE PSALMS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE PSALMISTS' INTENSIFIED ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS HOUSE AND CITY THROUGH THE SUFFERING, EXALTED, AND REIGNING CHRIST 3 PRAISING CHRIST AS THE KING 2 Scripture Reading: Psa 45:9-17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 45 can be considered the sixth station in the unveiling of Christ in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first station is Psalm 2; the second is Psalm 8; the third is Psalm 16; the fourth is Psalms 22 24; and the fifth is Psalm 40.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message on Psalm 45 we will consider verses 9 through 17.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we come to these verses, however, I would like to say a word concerning the Bible and the way to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible is a very particular, special, strange, and wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because the Bible is such a book, it cannot be understood by the natural human mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we try to understand the Bible according to our natural mind, we will not have the proper understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, in order to understand the Bible, we must exercise our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, we should exercise not the natural mind but the renewed, enlightened mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we would understand the Bible, we must have a mind that is renewed and enlightened, that is, a mind whose understanding is under the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, when we study the Bible, we should pray that the Lord will renew our mind and enlighten it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not have a renewed and enlightened mind, we will have trouble when studying Psalm 45, especially verses 9 through 15, which are about praising the king in the praising of the queen with the daughters of kings and with the virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may be bothered by the fact that this king has so many women with him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible teaches us that a man should have only one wife, and in the New Testament Paul tells us that an elder should be "the husband of one wife" 1 Tim 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the king in Psalm 45 seems to be like a heathen king who has a great many wives and concubines.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we will see, what we have in this psalm is a matter not of ethics but of typology, and to understand this type we need a renewed, enlightened mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Regarding the interpretation of the Bible, especially the book of Revelation, there are two schools.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the first school, the book of Revelation should be understood literally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who follow this school say the New Jerusalem is a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the second school, Revelation should be understood symbolically, since some items of its content are revealed by "signs" 1:1b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who follow this school say that as the golden lampstands are symbols of the churches, so the New Jerusalem is also a symbol, a sign.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible contains many symbols and types.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may regard these symbols and types as pictures or "photographs."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason for the photographs in the Bible is that the Bible unveils many heavenly, spiritual things, and these things are invisible and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The photographs in the Bible help us to understand such things.</S>
