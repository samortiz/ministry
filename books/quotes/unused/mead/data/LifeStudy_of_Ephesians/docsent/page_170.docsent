   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE GOD S DESIRE FOR A GLORIOUS CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that God s intention in His economy is to obtain a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Strictly speaking, God is not seeking a spiritual church, a heavenly church, nor even a victorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He wants a church of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Glory is the expression of God and it is altogether different from human morality and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When God filled the tabernacle and the temple, both of them were filled with glory, with the very manifestation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church should be characterized by glory not by anything else, not even spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am not happy to hear talk about a so-called spiritual church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The only way God can have a glorious church is through Christ s sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we experience these things in a personal and practical way, the church becomes glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible does not speak of a spiritual church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But in Ephesians 5 Paul speaks of a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One of Brother Nee s books is entitled The Glorious Church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians have as their goal a so-called spiritual church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead of seeking spirituality, we should seek to be filled with glory so that Christ may have His glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>GOD S GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of religious teachings, many have been blinded to God s desire for a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a sense, some have been helped by those teachings, but in another sense, they have been frustrated by them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Religious teachings can keep the saints from seeing the revelation of the glorious church and can cause them instead to seek such things as spirituality, gifts, and victory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ultimately, it is not God s intention to have a church that is merely spiritual, victorious, or heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His goal is a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not aspire to be like the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They may be spiritual, heavenly, and victorious, but they are not glorious, for they do not bear the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Praise the Lord that we who believe in Christ bear God s glory!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Religion actually brings people down to the level of angels.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Under the influence of the religious concept, many Christians are envious of the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we see God s economy, we shall reject such an influence and desire to become filled with glory in order that God may reach His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>NOT VICTORIOUS BUT GLORIOUS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is possible to be victorious without being glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, a brother may be pleased at his success in overcoming his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He may have been defeated by his temper for years and now at last he has gained victory over it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a victory, however, may be completely lacking in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s economy is not a matter of becoming victorious over such things as our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a matter of taking Christ as our life and our person and allowing Him to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result of this is the expression of God as glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In ourselves we may be victorious, but in order to be glorious we need Christ to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE DECEPTIVENESS OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In a sense, religion is deceptive.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While it is helping us, it is also deceiving us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reason is that religion is part truth and part falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This mixture of truth and falsehood is a subtle form of deception.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, it is rather easy to preach the gospel to the heathen and to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, it is very difficult to bring someone to the Lord who has had a background in Catholicism, for he has been cheated by the half-truths of that religious system.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the one hand, we have been helped by the religious teachings we received in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But on the other hand, these same teachings have veiled us in relation to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we need to discard religious concepts and teachings and come back to the whole truth of the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>GOD EXPRESSED THROUGH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the truth in the Word, God has no intention of gaining a group of spiritual beings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He already has myriads of angels.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God s goal is to have a glorious people as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the midst of this dark, evil age, God desires to have on earth a people full of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If the meeting hall were filled with angels, we would probably think that the situation of the church is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We perhaps would marvel at all the spiritual, heavenly, victorious beings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, such a situation would not be a true manifestation of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God expresses Himself not through angels, but through man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although we are men in the flesh, we can take Christ as our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we do this, even the angels will marvel at the expression of glory in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The angels may say, Look at these people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are full of God s glory!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do you still desire to have a spiritual church, a heavenly church, a victorious church?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you know God s economy, your desire will be for a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should be able to say to the angels, Angels, we don t envy your spirituality, victory, or heavenliness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have Christ within us as our life and our person, and we are being filled with glory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Angels, do you have Christ as your life and your person?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Gabriel could announce the birth of Christ, but he does not have the privilege of taking Christ as his life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Angels, we would like to tell you that Christ dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You may be spiritual, heavenly, and victorious, but we are glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 27 of Ephesians 5 has been in the New Testament for centuries, but it has been lost as far as the experience of believers is concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, today the Lord is in the process of recovering the glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Let us read this verse again: That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she should be holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christ is sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing us so that we may be a glorious church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He is not doing these things simply to make us spiritual, heavenly, or victorious.</S>
