   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Remembering Their Sin No More</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Jeremiah 31:34b we have yet another aspect of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here Jehovah says, "I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our sin and iniquity are great problems, but they have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before Jeremiah spoke of the new covenant, he spoke concerning Christ as the righteous Shoot of David, as the One whose name will be called Jehovah our righteousness 23:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This One has accomplished redemption; He has taken away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has solved the problem of sin, and now He is our redemption and our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Him we have been justified by God, and God has forgiven our iniquity and our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because we have been justified, there is no obstacle or frustration to keep us from having fellowship with God and to prevent Him from dispensing Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because we have been redeemed, justified, forgiven, and cleansed, we are free to contact God, and He is free to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has forgiven our sin, and He does not remember it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, there can now be communication, fellowship, between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Day by day we may converse with Him, enjoying Him and receiving His dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>ISRAEL SERVING</S>
