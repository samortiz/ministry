   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The Tabernacle and God's Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Firstly, God's glory, God's presence, is manifested in and through the finished building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then, Leviticus 1:1 says, "The Lord called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tent of meeting."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prior to this time, the Lord had always spoken to Moses in the cloud and in the fire on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But after the tabernacle was erected, God spoke in the tabernacle, in the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must realize that God's speaking is in and through His dwelling-place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, God speaks in the church and through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the time that God's first dwelling-place was completed, God spoke in that building.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Anyone desiring to hear the word of God must come to the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is exceedingly clear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we would receive the word of God, we must come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the church must be one with the tabernacle and the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God must be in the church, speaking all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can personally testify and prove that when a local church is properly built, God is always speaking there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A Christian may spend much time in personal Bible study, but he can never receive such a living word from God as when he is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The word spoken by God in His dwelling-place can never be substituted by any other kind of word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be clear, however, that God's living word is spoken only in the real building of the church, the real tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We do not want the old word, the old doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We want the fresh, living word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we must come to the real building of God to receive His word in full.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3 The Tabernacle and the Priestly Service</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Leviticus is a book of service and the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The third major point is that the service of God is entirely related to the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Peter 2:5 says, "Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices" King James Version .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word clearly reveals that the service of the priesthood is totally related to the building of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Following the words "spiritual house" there is a comma, with the words "an holy priesthood" following.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that the spiritual house is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christians are the living stones which are built up as a spiritual house, that is, the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Old Testament, boards were used for the building of the tabernacle, and the priests served within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This gives the semblance of two categories of things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in the New Testament, the living stones of the house, which correspond to the boards of the tabernacle, are the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spiritual house and the priesthood are one and the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The priests are the material of which the house is built.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The priesthood is not an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the priests formed together as one compose the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the house and also the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a corporate matter, a collective body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Strictly speaking, service to God is not an individual matter, but something of a corporate body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In typology, not one priest could serve God individually.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the priests served in coordination with one another as one body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must all realize that we cannot serve God by ourselves individually.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must serve in coordination with others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One stone can never be a house: it must be built up together with other stones to form a building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is impossible for an individual Christian to constitute the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I can never be a house by myself; I must be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means, strictly speaking, that if there is no building, there is no real service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How many Christians there are who think that as long as they love the Lord, they can serve Him individually, irrespective of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They take the attitude that they can serve the Lord regardless of whether the church is built up or not.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is only when we are built together that proper service can be rendered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Real service to God is something of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 12 speaks clearly of the Body of Christ functioning together in all kinds of ministries and services.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Prior to this chapter, which introduces the Body life, there is no mention of service.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This clearly indicates that the service of the Lord's people must be in the Body, the building, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In principle, this is why the book of Leviticus follows Exodus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Exodus is a record of building, and Leviticus is a book of service.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Service always follows building.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If there were no tabernacle, there could be no priests to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They certainly could not minister in their homes, for real service is a coordination with others in the tabernacle, in the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As Christians, we are individual persons, but we cannot be individualistic Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We cannot serve the Lord independently of others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Each individual priest must be coordinated with all the other priests.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a dreadful thing to attempt to serve the Lord apart from the proper church life, apart from being built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have witnessed too many Christians attempting to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually they failed God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must be built together as the priesthood to serve God in the building, the church, in a coordinated way.</S>
