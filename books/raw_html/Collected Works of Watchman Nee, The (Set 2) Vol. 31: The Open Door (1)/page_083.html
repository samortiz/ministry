<h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>Peace to Mr. X in the Lord,</p><p>From The Open Door, I found out about the condition of the Lord's work in all the localities. Thank the Lord, He always takes care of His work. My heart was very happy because He is the beginning and the end. Since He raised up the work, He will also complete it. The assembly in Peking really needs the light the Lord brought in through The Open Door&mdash;the principles of the work. May the Lord lead us according to these principles. All the brothers and sisters in Peking are safe under the Lord's protection. No one has lost their job yet. This is the result of the petitions of all the brothers and sisters. Please pray for me so that the Lord would revive my prayer life and so that my inner man would be strengthened. I am sending X dollars. X dollars are for the publication of The Open Door; the rest is for the use of the Lord's workers. Peace in the Lord. Please greet Brother Nee.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chu Teh-yau<br />January 17</p><h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>Sister Peace:</p><p>Thank God for His rich love and mercy. He never leaves those whom He has purchased by His blood! The assembly here is completely in God's hands. Every Saturday there is an edification meeting at five o'clock. I can always go. We mainly look to the Lord for His own work. On the Lord's Day morning there is a gospel meeting. Many people come to hear the word. Brother Hsu Zih-fang is being used by God to preach the messages. There are many brothers and sisters in the table meeting in the afternoon. Please pray for us much. May you be blessed with health in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister,<br />Shen Shi-shuan<br />January 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Peace to Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter of January 13. Thank the Lord that the sisters of Hsieh-Ho Hospital have had much improvement. More sisters are coming to the meetings, and the sisters in Peking are well. When we pray, we remember your work in the field and ask God to be with you so that you may express His glory in the regions of darkness. Sister Chiang writes sometimes. She is in Huang County, Shantung. She said that the Chinese New Year is a better opportunity to preach the gospel because the farmers have some free time. Praise the Lord! There are more prayer meetings at Foreign Ministry Street. We began a children's meeting on Friday about two months ago. Last Friday there were twenty-seven or twenty-eight children. It was really good. Brother Luan's last letter said that he may come to Peking to visit the brothers and sisters. We are eager for him to come. Everyone likes to hear him speak. Brother Wang Jien-tang from Tientsin is in Peking. He goes out every day for his personal business and the gospel. This morning he asked me to greet you. At one time we thought that you would be able to come to Peking. Now you are getting further and further away, so I do not know when I will be able to see you. May the Lord lead you. Please pray for what I mentioned above, and please pray for me. May God work in the heart of everyone who hears the gospel. Peace in the Lord. Greet the two sisters working with you.</p><p>Your little sister in the Lord,<br />Huang Jen-zhi<br />January 9</p>
