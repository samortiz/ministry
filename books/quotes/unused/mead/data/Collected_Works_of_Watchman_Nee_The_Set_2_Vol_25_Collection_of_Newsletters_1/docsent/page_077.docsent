   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Answer</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Your answer is according to the teachings of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the word in 1 Timothy 2:12 is "teach" in the original Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It means to teach as a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God does not allow sisters to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word in 1 Corinthians 11:4-5 is "prophesy" in the original Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God allows sisters to do this Acts 21:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 14:35 mentions "speaking in the church," which is in the meeting of the church of course, there are brothers there .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God does not allow sisters to do this either.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, in these three passages of the Bible, we see that a sister 1 cannot teach as a teacher or define doctrines, either in public or in private, 2 can prophesy, but 3 cannot speak in the church meetings no matter whether it is a teaching or a prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Long hair is God's natural sign to remind the woman to submit to authority and not be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Head covering is an outward sign that the woman submits to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Long hair manifests God's ordination for woman so it is a woman's glory ; head covering manifests a woman's submission to God so it can be called a woman's beauty .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Oh, God has such an ordination for woman that He would use her to manifest His wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She is so glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is so beautiful when she obeys God's ordination!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Long hair is a declaration that speaks forth God's ordination for woman; head covering is an amen that women respond to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a woman does not cover her head, she does not obey God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a woman cuts her hair or shaves her head, she overthrows God's ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, a sister should 1 not shave her head or cut her hair; rather, she should allow her hair to grow long to exhibit God's ordination for woman in the natural realm, and 2 cover her head to express her obedience to God's ordination by her actions Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To my dear brother in the Lord, Shih Chiu Jung:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I think you have already received my answer last week.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have not received the seventh issue of Collection of Newsletters to date.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our locality had an eight-day conference from the twenty-second to the twenty-ninth of this month during a break in the farming work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this conference, we preached two principles: 1 the emphasis in 1 Thessalonians 5:23 and 24 of the salvation of the believer's soul and its relationship to the Lord's return, and 2 only those moved by the Holy Spirit and who realize the Father's love will bear the fruits of repentance, receive salvation, and bear spiritual fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the Lord's blessing, both messages edified the spiritual life of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By the Lord's special grace, six brothers and eight sisters were baptized into the Lord's name during this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are still a few who will be baptized in a few days.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Recently, the Lord has expressed the power of His cross in our environment and has used His miraculous ways to save quite a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot cover up the Lord's glory any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have written the history of our meeting and its present condition so that the Lord's name may be praised.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How the Meeting in Ta Ch'aio Began</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ta Ch'iao is a small town in the northwest region of Huai An County about sixty miles from the city.</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He gathered us together to his house to meet in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We began meeting in December of 1928, but we did not establish the Lord's table until October of 1929.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There were only three brothers and four sisters who broke bread together to remember the Lord at the time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first years were very peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then all of a sudden, Mr. Ting's house was flooded.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the flood of July 1931, Mr. Ting's house was washed away by the water, and his whole family moved, so our meetings stopped for more than four months.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Later, we received the Lord's gift and rebuilt the house, so our meetings resumed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Unfortunately, problems came again not long after.</S>
