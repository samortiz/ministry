   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IS THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord not only said that He is the bread of life, but He also said that He is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Food is for satisfaction, while light is for seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When one is satisfied, he has the strength, and when one sees, he can walk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen how Christ is the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now let us consider how Christ is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we have to point out that the light of life is not the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone knows that as Christians, we should read the Bible properly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But if we read the Bible as a book of knowledge, a textbook of theology, we will merely gain knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we read the Bible this way, we may gain some doctrines from the Bible which are truly scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet these are mere letters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the time the Lord was born in Bethlehem, many priests and scribes could memorize the books of the prophets, but they did not know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today even though we have one book more than they, the New Testament, it is still possible for men to know only the letters of the Bible without knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not saying that we should not read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But we need to realize that when we read the Bible, it is possible that we will gain only knowledge instead of knowing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of the priests and scribes had only dead knowledge; they did not know the living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people think that the light of life is just knowledge, doctrines, theology, or church dogmas.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some persons say that they have received some light, but the light they are speaking of is not necessarily the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The light they are speaking of may only be interpretations of certain verses or certain teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At most they afford others a little more Bible knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The light of life is not knowledge or anything other than the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord said He Himself is the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The light of life is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, many people can tell us from their experience that what they see in the light of life is often difficult to articulate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Interestingly, those who see it see it, yet they cannot say what they have actually seen.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once someone talked to a sister to find out if she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He asked her a few questions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She answered, When I was first saved, I did not know what it was, but I knew I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you believe that I am saved, I am saved, and if you do not believe that I am saved, I am still saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What she said is true.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She was indeed saved, but she could not explain how she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She knew it, but she could not explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, when the light comes, we may not be able to tell others many doctrines; it may be two or three years later before we can utter some doctrines or teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This light is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we see the Lord, we see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What difference then does it make to us whether or not we see the light?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What change will there be if we see the light?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The difference is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we truly see the light, we will fall to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The light not only enlightens us but also kills us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before Paul received the shining, it was not easy to put him on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But once he received the shining, he fell.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people always want to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They try hard to be humble; they act humble in the way they speak and the way they act.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But this kind of humility is very exhausting; even others feel exhausted for them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is like a small child lifting a big dictionary; the book may not be very heavy, but it is exhausting for him to carry it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not easy for a proud man to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not easy for us to fall down from the throne of pride.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But once the light of the Lord shines on us, we fall immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot explain it, but as soon as the light shines, we fall.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Teachings cannot make a man fall.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A person can hear eight or ten teachings, and may even be able to recite them clearly and reasonably, but he remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A message which should bring one to tears, or which should touch one s carnal living and bring a man to his knees, can be turned into a subject of study, and a person may think that he has received something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a doctrine becomes a thing, a teaching becomes a thing, and words become a thing, the result is death; it is not light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One brother was so happy after he heard the teachings of Romans 6 that he thought he had seen Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But after a few days, he and his wife fell into a big argument.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Romans 6 that he saw was a thing; it was letters from a book; it was not the light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If what he saw was light, he would not have been the same.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He would fall down in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Light is piercing; it can do what a man cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A teaching will not do it, the brothers and sisters will not be able to help, and our own effort will not achieve it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But the minute the light shines, everything is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may say that we are very stubborn, but once the light shines, we will become soft.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When John saw the light, he became as dead Rev 1:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When Daniel saw the light, he fell toward the ground as dead Dan 10:5-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>No one can see the Lord s face without falling down, and no one can see the Lord without becoming as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is difficult to make ourselves die or to humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But once the light shines, everything follows.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord s light kills.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Once a man receives the Lord s light, he falls.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord Jesus Himself is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hence, when a man meets the Lord, he sees.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When a man meets the Lord, he falls and becomes weak as though he were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>With many people, their old personality is stubborn and has never been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is useless for others to try to deal with their personality.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is also useless for them to try to deal with it themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, once the Lord s light shines on them, they receive sight and become broken men.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whenever a man sees the Lord, he becomes weak.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whenever a man sees the Lord, he is broken and cannot survive.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is the meaning of light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brothers and sisters, we must never substitute any other thing for the light.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What we usually speak of as light is not necessarily light itself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Most things are mere teachings and so-called truth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They do not have any spiritual value to us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Once a brother who loved the Lord very much met a man who said to him, I am very glad because I found the doctrine of sin in Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When the brother heard this he said, Friend, did you only find the doctrine of sin in Romans today?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I think you should have found the reality of sin in yourself long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Many people are looking for doctrines, but they have not found the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Doctrines are mere words, and they are death.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They are not light, they are not life, and they are not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When the light comes, the first thing it does is kill.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We should not think that light only gives us sight.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>On the contrary, when the light comes, the first thing it does is to take away our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The light makes us see, but that is a later result.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>At first the light makes us blind and makes us fall; afterwards, we see.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Anything that cannot make us fall to the ground is not the light.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Anything that cannot humble us is not the light.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Paul saw the light and fell to the ground, and his eyes could see nothing for three days Acts 9:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we first encounter light, we become confused.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When a person in darkness first sees light, he cannot distinguish anything; everything seems confusing to him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Anyone who is self-assured and who thinks he knows everything needs God s mercy, because such a man has never seen the light.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>All that he knows are doctrines and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Once he sees the true light he will say, Lord, what do I know?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The greater the revelation, the blinder one becomes, and the more severe a blow one suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Light makes a person humble; it makes a person fall.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Only after this will a person see.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>If we have never suffered any blow and never been humbled, and if we have never been confused and never felt that we knew nothing, we have never encountered any light, and we are still in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that His light may take away our self-assurance and so that we will not be so confident that we are right, that we are not wrong, and that we know so much.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>May we say before the Lord, Lord, You are the light.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Now I know that what I saw before was nothing but things.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Light is not something abstract; it is something very concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The Lord Jesus is the light.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>When the Lord Jesus was among us, He was light among us, the very light walking among us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>What a pity that to some Christians so many things are abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>They hear this and that doctrine, but everything is abstract to them.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>They only know some abstract doctrines, but have not received any practical help.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>One brother was studying in a parochial school when he was young.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>He went to church often and heard the teaching concerning salvation many times.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Yet he had never met anyone who was saved, nor was he himself saved.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>One day he met a man preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>When he heard the gospel the man preached, he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>He had not been saved earlier because he had heard only abstract doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>On that day, he met a genuinely saved person; he met something concrete, and he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>One brother once related his experience of studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>He said, I had heard many brothers and sisters speaking on sanctification, and I went to study the doctrine of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>I found more than two hundred verses about holiness in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>I memorized them all and arranged them in proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Yet I still did not know what sanctification was; it was meaningless to me.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Then one day I met an elderly sister who was a truly sanctified person.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>On that day my eyes were opened, and I saw what sanctification is.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>I met a person who was sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The light was so bright that it hurt; when it came there was no way for me to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The light showed me the meaning of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>From these experiences we can see that light is something concrete, living, and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>If you merely convey doctrines to others, the result will be merely doctrines in them.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>This is dead, and this is not the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The light of life will shine in their lives and will shine out from them.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>We must remember that with the Lord Jesus, light is something concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>With us, it is also something concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>This light is a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>When this light appears, it is something living in us also.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Brothers and sisters, why does it seem as if God s Word has lost its power in these days?</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Why does it appear so weak and abstract?</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>The only reason is that there are too many doctrines!</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>There is too much truth and too much knowledge of theology!</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>We have to realize that only the living Lord can produce living persons.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>May the Lord truly have mercy on us to show us as the days go by that all things are dead and only the Lord is living.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>In Christianity even the nicest looking things, the sweetest sounding things, and the things men consider most spiritual are dead if they are outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>The Lord Himself should be everything in us.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>He Himself is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Only He is living.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>He is living in us, and when He is passed on to others, He will be living in them as well.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will prostrate ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>When we do this, we will know the Lord in a way different than we did before.</S>
