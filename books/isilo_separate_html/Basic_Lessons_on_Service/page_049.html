In this lesson we want to begin to fellowship about the enjoyment of the peace offering. For this lesson we need to read all of Leviticus 3. I feel that we need to help the saints to read this chapter very carefully, and we need to ask them to pay their full attention to two things: the blood and the fat. We have seen that the net above the liver is also God's portion from the peace offering. The net is a part of the fat. In addition to this, there are the two kidneys and the fat tail. Actually, the fat tail is additional fat (Lev. 3:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Enjoyment of the Peace Offering</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God's Portion</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Blood</H2><P>In this lesson we want to cover God's portion of the enjoyment of the peace offering. God's portion firstly is the blood (Lev. 3:2, 8, 13, 17; 7:26-27, 33). The fat is for God, and the blood is also for God. Men were not allowed to eat the fat or to drink the blood. Leviticus 3:17 says, "It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations wherever you dwell, that you shall not eat any fat or any blood." This verse strongly charges that no fat or blood should be taken by anyone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) To Satisfy His Righteous Requirements</H2><P>The blood satisfies God's righteous requirements. God needs the blood. God desires to have fellowship with His chosen people, but He is righteous. His righteous requirements will not allow Him to have fellowship with His chosen people as long as they have sins. Therefore, the blood is required. We may say that our sin or our sins require the blood, but actually, it is not so accurate to say this. The most we can say is that our sin or our sins need the blood to solve their problem. But the requirements are not on our side; the requirements are on God's side. God's righteous requirements need the blood. So the blood firstly satisfies God's righteous requirements.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) To Maintain His Holy Position</H2><P>Righteousness is a condition, whereas holiness is a position. The blood is needed to satisfy God's righteousness, and it is also needed to maintain God's holiness, God's holy position. If God came to fellowship with us sinners without the blood, this would overthrow His position. He is the holy God, and His position is altogether holy, separated from anything common.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
