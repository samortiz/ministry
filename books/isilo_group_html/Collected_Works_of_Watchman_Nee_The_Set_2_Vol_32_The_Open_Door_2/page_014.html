Even though we are separated in the body, thank the Lord that we meet daily before the Lord's throne of grace. Last week Sisters Bi Yung-chin, Liao En-rong, and Liu Su-chin came back from Mien-Yang and related the wonderful work that is going on there. God's power has done this work. Praise the Lord that the busier we are, the more we see that only God is working; man is absolutely useless. Is Mrs. Yuen still in Chungking? I have sent her two letters but have not received any reply. How is the health of Brother Chang Yu-zhi? Please give him my greetings. May the Lord remind us to pray for one another.</p><p>A little sister in the Lord,<br />Chang Yin-hwei, June 6</p><h2 class="head3">Six</h2><p>Thank our God because He bestows grace to His own at all times and in all places! Recently, I received a letter from Lin-Yi. It was from my brother and sister. Although their houses were burned, they were unharmed. My brother retreated with the staff of the post office to the rural countryside a few hours before the surrender of the city. My sister moved into the Lin-Yi Hospital, while my mother stayed in the church building. Except for a small part, the whole city of Lin-Yi was leveled. However, the church building was preserved. I see God's grace upon them! Since the Lord has preserved them on this earth, He will surely provide for their need. Today I received a postcard from Sister Chang Pei-ling. She is presently in Han-Tsung.</p><p>Sister Chiao Yu-yin, June 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Seven</h2><p>Sisters Luh Tsi-tsien and Chang Chiang-sien are safe in Ch'eng-tu. After Sisters Bi, Liao, and Liu returned from Mien-Yang, they left for Mien-Tsu. Their health is not too good, but God has granted them enough grace, and their work has been blessed. Mrs. Gu has been doing very well recently. Since your departure, my health has not been good, and I have felt weak often. After Sister Chang Jiang-ngo finished her test, she examined me and moved in to care for me. This has been going on for more than a week already. This is the Lord's grace, and I thank the Lord for this!</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Shen Ma Min-shiu, June 16<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>On Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of last week, the brothers and sisters gathered together to pray in one accord. Praise the Lord, He has heard our call and has been with us. We truly have to praise Him! As a result we had three evenings of special conferences. Brother Yu was responsible for releasing some messages concerning the house of God. They covered how God loves His children, how believers should consecrate themselves, how we live as members of the Body, etc. We see the Lord beginning to work among us. God has indeed blessed us through these few meetings. Please remember us in your prayer so that the church can experience a great revival and every believer can have an excellent testimony to glorify the Lord!</p><p>Wu Yeu-an, Du Tsong-chen, Lin Kwang-biao, Yu Cheng-hwa<br />May 22<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 32: The Open Door (2) &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
