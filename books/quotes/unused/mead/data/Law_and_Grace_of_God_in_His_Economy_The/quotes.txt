[1]  This book is a translation of messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California on February 15-16, 1992.
[2]  The general subject of this Chinese New Year s conference is the law and grace of God in His economy.
[3]  We are not here merely to see the law and grace of God; it is not that simple.
[4]  4 The accomplishment of the experience of the grace in God s economy is the organic Body of Christ, which consummates in the New Jerusalem.
[5]  Next to the tree of life was the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
[6]  God put man in front of the two trees and let man choose which tree he would eat.
[7]  He did not eat of the tree of life, which signifies God as his life, that he might have God s life organically and live out God.
[8]  After eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Adam fell from God into sin Rom 5:12 , and the substance of death entered into him to constitute him a sinner dead by nature v. 19a . Adam not only committed a trespass and offended God and thus had an outward sinful act, but even more he had an inward sinful nature and was constituted a sinner.
[9]  God s original intention was that man would be for the producing of an organism, but man altogether became sinful, falling under God s condemnation to suffer eternal perdition.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE GRACE OF GOD IN HIS ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Rom 6:14; Heb 8:13, 7, 6b; John 1:1, 14, 17b; 2 Cor 8:9a; 13:14a; 1 Pet 1:2b; 2 Pet 1:2; Eph 1:7b-8; Rom 5:15b, 20b; Eph 1:6-7; Rom 3:24; 5:2a; John 1:16; 1 Tim 1:14; Eph 2:5-8; 2 Thes 2:16; Heb 4:16; 2 Cor 9:8; Rev 22:21; James 4:6; 1 Pet 5:5; 2 Tim 4:22; Luke 1:28, 30; Gal 2:20-21; 2 Cor 12:9; 8:1-2; 1 Pet 5:10; Eph 3:2, 8; 4:28-29; 1 Cor 15:10; Rom 5:17b, 21b; Acts 4:33; 11:23 OUTLINE The New Testament believers being not under the law in God s economy but under the grace in God s economy Rom 6:14: The law being for the old covenant in God s economy, which is also called the first covenant, a covenant which is becoming old and growing decrepit and which is near to disappearing Heb 8:13b, 7a.
[11]  Grace being for the new covenant in God s economy, which is also called the second covenant, the better covenant Heb 8:13a, 7c, 6b.
[12]  The grace of God in His economy being His embodiment: God becoming flesh to be grace for man s enjoyment John 1:1, 14.
[13]  Grace coming through Jesus Christ the grace of Christ John 1:17b; 2 Cor 8:9a; 13:14a.
[14]  In these last days God is speaking among us.
[15]  To be without God s speaking is a terrible thing.
[16]  God s word is light, God s word is revelation, God s word is life, God s word is supply, and God s word is simply God Himself, the Lord Himself, and the Spirit Himself.
[17]  In this message I hope that the Lord would grant us grace and give us His speaking that we may see what the grace of God in His economy is.
[18]  Today we are not the saints in the Old Testament who were under the law; rather, as the New Testament believers, we are all under the grace of God.
[19]  God does not require us to do anything; He does everything for us from the beginning to the end. It was God who carried out His incarnation, it was He who lived out His human living for thirty-three and a half years, it was He who accomplished the all-inclusive death on the cross, it was He who attained His entrance into resurrection, and it was He who accomplished His entrance into ascension.
[20]  BEING HIS EMBODIMENT A. God Becoming Flesh to Be
[21]  He is the God-man; He is God yet man, and man yet God.
[22]  BEING RICH, MULTIPLYING, AND ABOUNDING A. The Grace of God and
[23]  The grace of God in His economy is rich, multiplying, and abounding Eph 2:7; 1 Pet 1:2b; 2 Pet 1:2; Eph 1:7b-8 .
[24]  If we use our own flesh and its natural endeavor, we cannot enjoy God as grace, but if we believe into Christ, we have access into the full enjoyment of the grace of God.
[25]  I. Enjoying the Lord s Presence in Our Spirit
[26]  In our experience of the grace in God s economy, we enjoy the Lord s presence in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22; cf.
[27]  The Lord being with us in our spirit is grace being enjoyed by us in our spirit.
[28]  If we do not live out God s righteousness by Christ, we nullify the grace of God.
[29]  Paul experienced the Lord s grace to be a surpassing one and to labor abundantly for the Lord 1 Cor 15:10 .
[30]  Today, the resurrected Christ brings the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may experience Him as grace and thus be a surpassing one and labor abundantly for the Lord.
[31]  IN THE BELIEVERS EXPERIENCE Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14, 16-17; Matt 28:19; John 14:8-11, 16-20; 7:37-39; 6:63; 20:22; 1 John 4:13; 2:27; Rev 2:1, 7; 22:17, 21; Eph 4:6; 2 Cor 13:14; John 15:5; Eph 3:17; Rom 8:11, 16; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; Heb 10:29; Zech 12:10; Rom 8:4b-6; Rev 22:1 OUTLINE The grace in God s economy in the believers experience being the processed Triune God: God, who was in the beginning, becoming flesh in time as grace for man to receive, possess, and enjoy John 1:1, 14, 16-17: The incarnated God being triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit Matt 28:19: The Father as the source being embodied and expressed in the Son John 14:8-11.
[32]  The Son being realized as the Spirit and abiding in the believers John 14:16-20.
[33]  The Spirit being in the believers as their life and life supply the living water of life, the bread of life, and the breath of life and becoming the divine grace enjoyed by them John 7:37-39; 6:63; 20:22.
[34]  The indwelling Spirit, the processed Triune God, abiding in the believers as the anointing and becoming their enjoyment in life 1 John 4:13; 2:27.
[35]  In this message we come to the most crucial point, which is the grace in God s economy in the believers experience.
[36]  The everyday experience of the believers must be grace.
[37]  If it is not grace, it is not the believers experience; if it is not grace, it is not the Christian living.
[38]  The Christian living must be the living of grace, the experience of grace.
[39]  In the preceding message we saw that grace is God s embodiment Christ.
[40]  Hence, the grace experienced by the believers is Christ, the embodiment of God.
[41]  In His incarnation He as God was transformed to become a man.
[42]  The Spirit, whom God has given to dwell in us, is the witness in our spirit, witnessing that we dwell in God and God in us.
[43]  B. With the Love, the Grace, and the Fellowship
[44]  In the love, the grace, and the fellowship of the Divine Trinity, the love of God the Father, who is over all and through all and in all, is the source Eph 4:6; 2 Cor 13:14b .
[45]  A. The Processed Triune God, Consummated as the All-inclusive, Life-giving, Compound, and Indwelling Spirit, Becoming the Spirit of Grace
[46]  In the New Testament age the Spirit of grace dispenses the Triune God into the believers as grace.
[47]  OF THE GRACE OF GOD IN HIS ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:6-8, 22-23; 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:18-21a; John 17:11, 21-23; Eph 4:3-4a; 1 Cor 1:13a; Eph 2:7, 10 OUTLINE The consummation being the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:6-8, 22-23: As the organism which God in His economy intends to obtain for the Divine Trinity.
[48]  As the ultimate goal of God s creation of man in His image and His intention for man to take Him as life.
[49]  Every part of the organic Body of Christ being an issue of the grace in the economy of God: With God the Father in His nature as its substance, as pure gold 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:18b.
[50]  For Your economy and Your speaking, we worship You.
[51]  In Christ we enjoy His element, and with His element we have been made God s precious possession.
[52]  Ephesians 1:22-23 shows us that the power that God caused to operate in Christ raised Him from the dead that He might transcend the world and ascend to the heavenlies, being seated on the right hand of God, crushing the enemy, having all things subjected under His feet, and thus being given to be the Head over all things.
[53]  Second, the organic Body of Christ takes God the Son in His redemption as its element, as pearls 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:21a .
[54]  C. With God the Spirit in His Transforming Work
[55]  Third, the organic Body of Christ takes God the Spirit in His transforming work as its essence, as precious stones 1 Cor 3:12; Rev 21:18a, 19-20 .
[56]  Since gold signifies God s divine nature, the New Jerusalem s being of pure gold signifies that the New Jerusalem is altogether of God s divine nature and takes God s divine nature as its element.
[57]  In such a unique attribute of the Divine Trinity, the organism of the Divine Trinity also possesses the same unique attribute v. 21a, 22b-23 . This oneness as the attribute of the Divine Trinity is called the oneness of the Spirit in the organic Body of Christ Eph 4:3-4a . In the organic Body of Christ, the creating of any divisions is an insult to and a contempt for the Triune God, whose attribute is oneness cf.
