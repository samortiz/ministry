   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE MYSTERY OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 2:2, 9; 3:4, 10-11; John 1:18, 16; Heb 1:3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to see the third great mystery in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This mystery, which is the mystery of mysteries and the center of all the mysteries, is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The mystery of the universe and the mystery of man in reality are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The mystery of the universe is God, and the mystery of man is also God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In a general sense, God is the mystery of the universe; in a particular sense, God is the mystery of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is the mystery of the universe and of man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, God Himself is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This mystery is simply Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE MYSTERY OF GOD BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the mystery of God preached by the apostle Paul 1 Cor 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not the shallow revelation that so many have preached; it is the mystery hidden in the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This mystery is not any superficial aspect of the gospel; it is the intrinsic reality of the complete gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This reality is Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we want to know how Christ is the mystery of God, we need to study the first two chapters of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Colossians 1 and 2 tell us what kind of person Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CHRIST AS THE PORTION OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Colossians 1:12 says that Christ is the God-allotted portion of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Old Testament, God allotted the land of Canaan, the land flowing with milk and honey, to the tribes of Israel; each tribe received a portion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This portion became the inheritance and blessing of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, in the New Testament, Christ is our God-given portion as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This portion, this inheritance, is the spiritual blessing which we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CHRIST AS THE IMAGE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Colossians 1:15 says that Christ, who is the Son of God's love, is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The image here is not a physical image but an expression of all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ as the Son of God's love has God's life and nature, so John 1:18 and 14:7-9 say that He expresses the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because He expresses the Father, He is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is invisible, but the Son of God's love, having God's life and nature, can express God; therefore, He is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the relationship between Christ and God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>CHRIST AS THE FIRSTBORN OF ALL CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Colossians 1:15 goes on to say that Christ is "the Firstborn of all creation."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ is the first One among all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This speaks of Christ having the preeminence among all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With regard to Christ being God, He is the Creator; but with regard to Christ being man, He is a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since He became a man and partook of the created blood and flesh, to be sure He is part of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Among the creatures, after the first Adam fell, there was a last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If Christ was not a creature, how could He become the last Adam?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If He was not a creature, He could not have become the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Adam is the name of a created one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You cannot say that the first Adam was created, yet the last Adam was not.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To say this is not logical.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to the original text of Colossians 1:15, we cannot deny that in God's creation, Christ is the first created One, who has preeminence in all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If He was not the first created One, He could not have the first place in all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For Him to have the first place among all creatures, He needed to become the first created One.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord that He is not only the Creator but also a creature!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, He is the first of all creation because He wants to have the first place in all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was a created man so He could die and shed blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If He was not a creature but was only God the Creator, He could not have died, because God can never die.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some people say, "Our Christ is only the Creator."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this case, I want to ask, "Does the Creator have blood?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Does the almighty Creator have flesh and blood?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If He had no blood, how could He shed blood for us?"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Dear brothers and sisters, we should not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Of course, our Lord is the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, He is also a creature.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is why He is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because He is a creature, He could die.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He actually died by being crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, He was buried in a tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If He was only the Creator and not a creature, would it not be absurd for Him to be buried in a tomb?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thank and praise the Lord that He also resurrected!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In His resurrection, His physical body was transformed into a spiritual body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First Corinthians 15 clearly says that through such a resurrection, He as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although He is the life-giving Spirit, He still has humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When He went back to the disciples after His resurrection, He went with a resurrected body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He showed them His hands and His side, and He told them to touch His side and the nail marks on His hands John 20:19-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is indeed the Spirit, but He still has a human body, so surely He has humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, today He is still the Son of Man in heaven Acts 7:56 ; in His coming back He will still be the Son of Man Matt 25:31 ; and even in eternity He will also be the Son of Man for eternity John 1:51 .</S>
