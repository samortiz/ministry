   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FELLOWSHIP WITH CO-WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN SHANGHAI, JUNE 1937 CHAPTER SIXTY-EIGHT THE EXPRESSION AND PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>OF THE LOCAL CHURCH Date: June 20, 1937, Lord's Day, 9:30 a.m.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Place: Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; 18:17</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Tonight I am going to talk a little about the expression and practice of the local church and also the relationship between the workers and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For those who have been attending our meetings regularly, we would like to explain the reason for having meetings like ours.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In other words, I am going to speak about the outward expression and practice of the church, not about its content.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE EXPRESSION OF THE PROPER TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What kind of expression should the testimony of the church have in order for it to be scriptural?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose we have the best kind of tea, but we have no cup.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without a cup this wonderful tea could not get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He can forever quench man's thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But without a "cup," man cannot receive anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have a cup that is dirty, we still have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we drink from the cup, we take in all sorts of things other than the water, and the taste of the living water will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider the famine in Szechuan province; there is a shortage of rice and grain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It would be very unkind for a person to sell bowls there.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, if there is rice, there is the need for the proper supply of bowls.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the "rice" and the church is the "bowl."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man receives Christ through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The problem today is not with the rice but with the bowl.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is not the problem; the problem is with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Along with its outward expression, we must also pay attention to the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The work of the cross deals with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But man's ways often activate the flesh in the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may think that mistakes in our living offend the Lord, but we may never realize that applying the flesh to the work is also an offense to God Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>44:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man assumes that he has the power and wisdom to complement God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today a few men gather together, pray a little, and then start a meeting or an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This kind of beginning can never be of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no doubt that the Spirit wants to accomplish something today, but the Spirit does not work independently.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, He works through man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If a man is fleshly, the Spirit cannot work in him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the Spirit, everything is dead, even if it is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's work is a matter of man cooperating and coordinating with the Spirit; it is neither a case of the Spirit working alone nor of man working alone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church of Christ has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first aspect, the universal aspect, is spoken of in Matthew 16.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The universal church includes all the believers both past and present.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is only one such church, and we cannot add another to it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The universal church is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second aspect, the local aspect, is spoken of in Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The local church includes all the local believers at a certain time and in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is limited to time and place.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It can be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why we see expressions in the Bible such as the "church" Acts 9:31 , the "seven churches" Rev 1:4 , and the "churches" 1 Cor 11:16; 14:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no difference in content between the universal church and the local church, except that the local church is a miniature of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul said that the Corinthian believers were the Body of Christ 1 Cor 12:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that the local church represents the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The local church should represent the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The universal church does not have any problems, and it will never have any problems.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The universal church is above all failure.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>No one can ever cause the universal church to have spots or wrinkles.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even the gates of Hades cannot prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the local church is in the hands of man, and there is the possibility of failure.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Throughout the two thousand years of the history of the local churches, there have been numerous mistakes and failures.</S>
