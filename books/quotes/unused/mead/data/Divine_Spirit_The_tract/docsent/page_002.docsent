   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Spirit of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Old Testament there is another particular designation of God as the Spirit, the Spirit of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most English translations render this term as the Spirit of the LORD, with the word LORD in small capital letters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Jehovah, meaning I am who I am, is the personal name of God, revealed to Moses before the children of Israel were led out of Egypt by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only the people chosen by God and in covenant with Him knew Him as Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, Jehovah designates God in His personal relationship with His chosen people, and the Spirit of Jehovah designates God as the Spirit coming to man in that personal relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The prophet Isaiah spoke of the Spirit of Jehovah resting upon the coming Messiah, the coming Christ, when He comes to restore Israel, His chosen people 11:1-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the Spirit of Jehovah, God is even more intimate with His people than He is as the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As such, He is not only the Divine Spirit but also the Spirit of all that God is, covenanted to His chosen people and applied to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again, as the Spirit of Jehovah, God reaches man and applies Himself to man as man s portion and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Perhaps the most wonderful title of God the Spirit is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This title occurs exclusively in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The three instances of Holy Spirit in the Old Testament Psa 51:11; Isa 63:10 and 11 are to be translated more accurately as the Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Holy Spirit is first mentioned when God came in to prepare the forerunner of the Lord Jesus, John the Baptist Luke 1:15 , and to prepare a body for the Lord Jesus Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the Holy Spirit is related to the incarnation of God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We often think of holiness as religious piety, but as applied to God, holiness is the unique attribute of God that separates Him from all else.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God alone is holy Rev 15:4 because He is unique in who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything in the universe shares something in common with everything else; all things are at least created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But God is unique.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That which makes Him unique is His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Holy Spirit is God the Spirit coming to man to apply God s holy, divine nature to man that man may be holy as God is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the incarnation of Christ, through the Holy Spirit God became man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The God-man Jesus Christ was frequently called the Holy One John 6:69; Acts 2:27; Mark 1:24; 1 Pet 1:15 because, being conceived and born of the Holy Spirit Matt 1:20 , He too was holy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Holy Spirit is active in the believers, supplying God s nature to them and making them holy as well.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The apostle Paul speaks of God s intention to make the believers holy when he writes: He chose us...to be holy,...predestinating us unto sonship Eph 1:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who believe in Christ were chosen to be holy, that is, to have God s divine life and holy nature and therefore be God s sons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To all who believe in Christ and repent of their sins, God is available as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is as available as the air that we breathe, and He desires to make men holy as He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we open to Him as the Holy Spirit, He enters us and bears God s divine life to us, regenerating us and granting to us His holy nature that we may be like Him.</S>
