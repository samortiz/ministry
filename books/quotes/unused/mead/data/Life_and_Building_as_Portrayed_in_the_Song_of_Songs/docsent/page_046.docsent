   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PRODUCING GARDEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By this time she had enjoyed the Lord richly, but she had never produced anything for the Lord's enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She had satisfaction, but she had not produced anything for the Lord and for others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She must become a garden to grow out something for the Lord and for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, she did become a garden producing all the things she enjoyed of the Lord in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She enjoyed myrrh; now she grows myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She enjoyed frankincense and the henna flower; now she grows frankincense and the henna flower.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She enjoyed all of the powders of the merchant; now she grows all of the spices for making the powders.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever she had enjoyed, she now grows.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In her enjoyment the Lord entered into her, and now in her growth the Lord comes out of her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord firstly wrought Himself into her, and now He is producing Himself out of her.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not mere doctrine; it is the real experience of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>So many will tell you that this is exactly what they have been experiencing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all must be such a garden to the Lord, growing out all we have enjoyed of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The day we were saved we became, in a sense, a garden, producing something for the Lord and for others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But that was not so adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to grow, step by step, stage by stage, until we reach the stage of being a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a sense we have been a garden, but we are not in the stage of a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must go on until we arrive at the stage of being a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A FURTHER DISCREPANCY</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the seeking one reached the stage of a garden, according to the poetry, she became contented again.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>She was so satisfied with her spiritual attainment that it created a kind of discrepancy between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every time we are contented with our spiritual attainment, this satisfaction becomes a discrepancy between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are satisfied, but the Lord would have us go on.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must not stay with what we have attained.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is wonderful to be a crown, but do not stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is marvelous to be on the top of Lebanon, but do not stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is splendid to come down and become a garden, but do not stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Once we are content, we lose the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OUTWARDLY SLEEPING, INWARDLY LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of her contentment, the seeking one has a repetition of the experience in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She is within, and He is without.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But this time the situation is much different.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a fact; by this time she is really resting from all her activity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a real improvement in her spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are always wanting to do too many things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the more we grow in the Lord, the more we give up natural activity; we rest from all our activities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Outwardly we sleep, but inwardly we are living!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are very much on the alert for the Lord's presence and for His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can hear the Lord immediately whenever He speaks, and we can realize whether His presence is with us or not.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is by this she discovers a discrepancy between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are away from the Lord, He will always call us back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we come back to Him, we become exceedingly active to do many things for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But gradually, especially as we get into the church life, all our activities will be slain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eventually we will simply say, "I sleep."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are no more activities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we are not dead!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are very living within!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many times those outside of the church condemn us by saying that the church life stops many good activities.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So many missionaries, after contacting the church, ceased going to the mission field.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the denominations encourage Christians to go to the mission field.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But the proper church life stops them from going.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is true.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>So many missionaries, pastors, and Christian workers have become captured by the church life from all their natural activities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more we stay in the church, the more we are dead to our activity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then we rest from all our activities outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But inwardly we are exceedingly living, always listening for the voice of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we are active, the Lord will tell us to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But when we become quiet, resting from all our activities, the Lord will say, "Don't be so quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I'm still under the dew and the drops of the night."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is still working and suffering to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In a sense, He has accomplished everything and has ascended to the heavens where He sits at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But in another sense, He is still working and suffering to build His corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord shows the seeking one that while she is resting, He is still working.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This reveals to her the discrepancy between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a real picture of the incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord was God, but He became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As God, it was not necessary for Him to be under the dew to suffer in the night.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But He became a "man of sorrows," continually suffering for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord was asking her to relinquish all her spiritual attainment and to suffer with Him for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Her reply was, "I have put off my coat.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>How can I put it on?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I have washed my feet, how can I defile them again?"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This poetry shows how she had put off all her natural life and washed away all her defilements from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>She was so spiritual, so undefiled, so pure, and so holy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>How could she go back?</S>
