   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TREE OF LIFE, THE MANNA, AND THE FEAST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The practicality of God's expression is not only in Revelation chapter one, but also in chapters two and three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these two chapters the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man who is in the midst of the churches as the lampstands does not only purify the churches that they may shine with pure light, but also promises to feed them with the tree of life 2:7 , the hidden manna 2:17 , and the feast 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verses 2:7 and 17 are promises of rewards to the overcomers that they may enjoy the tree of life and the hidden manna in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that all the seeking saints may have a foretaste of the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life and hidden manna in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What the overcomers will enjoy in the full taste in the coming kingdom, they should enjoy in this age as a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the practicality of God's expression we could and should have a foretaste of the reward which the Lord promises to give us in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 3:20 is a promise for this age, that the seeking saints by opening themselves toward the Lord, may enjoy the Lord's presence and feast with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These three promises are the fulfillment of the enjoyment of the tree of life in Genesis 2, the manna in Exodus 16, and the rich produce of the good land in Deuteronomy 12.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For the practicality of God's expression in the Lord's recovery, the Lord would feed us with all these particular portions of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A WHITE STONE FOR GOD'S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord's promise in Revelation 2:17 also implies that by enjoying the hidden manna we may be transformed into a white stone for the building of God's spiritual house for His expression 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And the Lord's promise in Revelation 3:12 also indicates that a seeking saint may be made a pillar in God's temple, bearing God's name and the name of the New Jerusalem for the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This should be also by the nourishment of the tree of life, the manna, and the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the practicality of the local churches as God's expression today, the enjoyment of the rich Christ as our particular nourishment is needed that we may be transformed into precious stones for the building up of God's eternal dwelling place to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE CONSUMMATE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the consummation of God's expression in eternity, the enjoyment of the tree of life and the water of life will also be a particular feature in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tree of life and the water of life will still continue to supply God's redeemed people in the new heaven and new earth for them to express God in full for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This shows that both for the practicality and the consummation of God's expression, the particular enjoyment of God's rich Christ is a prerequisite.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Without such enjoyment of Christ, the church life in the Lord's recovery will be just an empty shell which has no value for God's expression.</S>
