   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED TO EXPERIENCE ALL THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DEATH PROCESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because we are not willing to die, God in His sovereignty prepares everyone and everything necessary to bring us into death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He may prepare a "Judas" to betray you and a good-hearted "Peter," who may think that he is helping you by defending you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that Peter only caused trouble for the Lord Jesus by cutting off the ear of the slave of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One of the other Gospels records the fact that it was necessary for the Lord to heal the slave's ear.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The "Peters" who think they are helping us may actually be used to bring us into death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God has a way to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some of us had the concept that if we loved the Lord and took His way in the recovery, everything related to us would be flourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We expected to have a good wife or husband and children who were obedient and would eventually become successful in their professions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, many of us can testify that the more we love the Lord and take His way, the more troubles we have.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord may prepare someone to betray us and others, like the high priest, to reject us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There may even be a "Pilate" who will deliver us to those who intend to crucify us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these things are prepared by God and make it possible for us to go through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, instead of a good environment, the situation may be the exact opposite of what we expected.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The reason for this is that everything works together to help us go through the death process.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to Romans 8:28, God causes all things to work together for good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But they work together according to God's understanding of matters, not according to our own understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we quote Romans 8:28, we should not forget the context of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This chapter speaks of suffering upon suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, God causes all things to work together for good in that we are prepared to pass through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apparently, after the Lord Jesus came to the garden, nothing was good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, everything was good, because everything was a preparation for the death process.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Within a short period of time after coming to the garden, He entered into that process.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Judas' betrayal, Peter's resistance, the high priest's rejection, and Pilate's judgment were all helpful in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All these things contributed to the process by which the Lord Jesus entered into death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But He was ready for this, for He was ready to be sown as a grain of wheat so that through death and resurrection He might be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My burden in these messages on chapter eighteen is to point out that according to the emphasis in the Gospel of John, the Lord's death was mainly for multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now this multiplication should continue with us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As the many grains produced by the one grain, we are the branches of the vine to bear fruit for the glorification of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our fruit-bearing is the continuation of the multiplication, of the divine glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This fruit-bearing cannot be prevailing unless we are willing to pass through the death process.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In nature we see that in order to bear fruit many kinds of trees must pass through the "winter" of death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With us, if there is no death, there will be no fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First there must be death, and then resurrection will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In resurrection we have fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The only way for the Lord to have His increase today is for us to be willing, as He was, to experience all the preparations for the death process.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should thank the Lord that with us also there is the necessary preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There may be a Judas, a Peter, religion's opposition and rejection, and a trial before the rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All these preparations form a process of death for us to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we go through this process, the Lord's multiplication, His glorification, will continue.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This multiplication, this glorification, this increase, will be repeated again and again through the process of death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the Lord's death for reproduction, for multiplication, which is His glorification.</S>
