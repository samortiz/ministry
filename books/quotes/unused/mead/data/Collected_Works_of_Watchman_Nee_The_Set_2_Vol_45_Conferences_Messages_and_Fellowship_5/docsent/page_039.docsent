   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Gifts</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians feel ashamed of themselves because they do not have many gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is true that some have profound wisdom, quick mentality, power, eloquence, or great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But are these things Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a big difference between gifts and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was once proud of my own wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I thought that I was wiser than others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time I was living in darkness, the same as some of you are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Like Paul, I could say, "I advanced...beyond many contemporaries" Gal 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today I realize how foolish and shameful I was.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time, however, I considered myself wonderful and sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I even believed that my advancement was real.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I first became a Christian, I spent a great deal of time in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once I read Andrew Murray's book, The Spirit of Christ, and I was so attracted by it that I did not want to eat or sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I just wanted to read on; I could not put it down.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later, I read Philippians 3:3, which says to "serve by the Spirit of God."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I cannot quote the verse verbatim tonight, but the power of this word still remains with me today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Someone can understand the teaching of Philippians 3:3 and pass it on to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when I read it, I asked myself, "Am I reading this, or is it Christ who is reading this?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That night, for the first time, I experienced an aversion for "things."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I was not grasping on to Christ, but to things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Up to that point it had been only a teaching, a kind of research; it was not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In spiritual matters it is very easy to have spiritual "things" without having Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the greatest work of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When something becomes a thing or an object, it becomes dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today there are many works, testimonies, and studies that can only be considered as things, not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is not easy to replace Christ with ornaments and physical objects, but it is very easy to replace Him with experiences, gifts, and works.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A few weeks ago, someone asked me, "What is your opinion concerning miraculous things?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To tell you the truth, I have not seen many miraculous things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when I have seen them, there has been very little of Christ in those things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many people pride themselves in these things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They advertise these things and regard them as necessary for their power and recognition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Little do they realize that they are merely things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not against anyone having these things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But like Paul, I would say, "Moreover I show to you a most excellent way" 1 Cor 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 1926 I intended to work in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I felt that I should not go, but I went anyway.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I could not say that I was rebelling against the Lord, but neither could I say that I was obeying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I did not find peace and could not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I could only utter some formal prayers and read the Word in a ritualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The result of the work was good and many people were saved, but I was grieving.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It was Sister Barber's wish that I not leave Foochow, but when someone wrote to her and told her of the result of the work, she commended me for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, I still did not feel at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I was working by the gifts that God had given me; I considered these gifts as things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They were merely things and not Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today I can say that my gift is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This gift is a person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If I am related to the gifts without being related to Christ, the gifts will only be things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the Corinthian believers had gifts, their gifts were dead because Christ was not there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once light comes, everything is stripped away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everyone treasures and boasts in the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When a man has some gifts, he often thinks that he is better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we have light, we will see that our gift and power are nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The very empowering strength is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not just a slogan; it has to be a genuine seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Real gifts are not things; they are Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Daily Walk Prayer and the Study of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Prayer and the study of the Word are two common aspects of the daily walk of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But to many, these two things are just things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The day I read Andrew Murray's book, I asked myself, "Is your Bible reading Christ or is it merely a thing?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Are your many prayers Christ or are they things?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If something has no life, it remains a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All that we struggle to do apart from Christ and all that we accomplish without contacting Christ are merely things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God may not want us to know a great deal of knowledge, or He may not want us to know it yet.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But many of us have a lust for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We want to know the answers to all the problems in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we cannot solve these problems, we cannot sleep or eat.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many of us engage in studies against our inner guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Others may not know if we are touching things or touching Christ, but we know.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the disciples went to fish, they labored for the whole night without success.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the morning broke, Someone asked if they had anything to eat and told them to cast their net on the right side of the boat.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>At that very moment they knew that it was the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Touching the Lord is very different from touching things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Things are rigid, dead, cold, and outward; they cannot touch a person.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The church can never be cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Although many young believers cannot articulate a point with their mouth, they know inwardly and can tell if something is Christ or just a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I am not saying that Bible reading is unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I am saying that all the spiritual things spoken of in the Bible are just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Every thing that is apart from Christ is not Christ; it is merely a thing.</S>
