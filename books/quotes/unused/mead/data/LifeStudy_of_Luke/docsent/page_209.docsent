   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S VINDICATION AND APPROVAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE MAN-SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND HIS ALL-INCLUSIVE REDEMPTIVE WORK</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first point of the objective aspect of the Man-Savior s resurrection is that it was God s vindication and approval of the Man-Savior and His all-inclusive redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By resurrection God vindicated and approved the Man-Savior; God also vindicated and approved the Lord s redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, God vindicated the Person and work of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With each one of us there is the matter of both person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our person is what we are, and our work is what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The criticism of others is always related either to their person or to their work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This certainly was the situation with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to the four Gospels, there was much criticism, especially from the Jewish leaders, of Christ s Person and deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Concerning His Person, some said that He was a Samaritan John 8:48 , that He was beside Himself, that is, mentally ill Mark 3:21 , and that He was demon possessed John 8:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, His works were condemned by the Pharisees as a blasphemy to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The religious leaders surely denied, rejected, and condemned the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They sentenced Him to death and had Him crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was the attitude of the leaders of the Jewish nation, those among whom Christ was born, lived, and worked.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The religious leaders regarded the Man-Savior as worse than a criminal and a murderer, as someone worse than Barabbas.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They condemned both Him and His work; they rejected both His Person and His deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Their rejection of the Man-Savior was to such an extent that they sentenced Him to be put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose the Man-Savior had not been resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose His body was left in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If so, then the Jewish leaders would have won the case.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, God resurrected Christ and thereby vindicated Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This kind of vindication was extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the Lord was crucified and buried, God raised Him up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Raised Up by God</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the book of Acts we are told a number of times that God raised up, resurrected, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, referring to the Lord Jesus, Acts 2:24 says, Whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Acts 2:32 says, This Jesus God raised up, of which we all are witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Acts 3:15 speaks of the Author of life...whom God raised from the dead, and 4:10 tells of Jesus Christ the Nazarene...whom God raised from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other verses in Acts that speak of God raising up Jesus from among the dead are 5:30; 10:40; 13:30, 33-34, 37; 17:31 and 26:8.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason this is repeated so often is that the entire book of Acts is a book of the testimony of the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The apostles testimony was that of the resurrection of the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God vindicated Christ by raising Him up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s Vindication</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Man-Savior s Person and work were both rejected and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The religious leaders thought that they were through with Him and that they could now joyfully be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But God came in to resurrect the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God did not argue with the religious leaders; He did not have a conference to negotiate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, God seemed to say, I don t care to talk to you foolish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I shall do one thing I shall raise up the very One you crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My raising Him up is my vindication of Him and His work, but it is a shame to those who condemned Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord Jesus was the turning point of human history.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What He did has affected the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Through resurrection, God, the supreme Judge, vindicated the Man-Savior and His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s Approval</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The resurrection of Christ was not only God s vindication, it was also God s approval of Him and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In resurrecting the Lord Jesus, God seemed to be saying to the Jewish nation with its leaders, I approve what you condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You say that Jesus was blaspheming Me. But I approve what He did, what He said, and what He was.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You thought that you could put Him to death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the cross He suffered your persecution, and then He accomplished My redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I approve of His redeeming work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He accomplished the redemption I had planned in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I not only vindicate Him and His work I also approve Him and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to John 10, the Lord Jesus laid down His life and took it again by God s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God commanded Him to lay down His life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, God came in to vindicate and approve the Lord Jesus and His work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Again God seemed to be saying, If I did not approve Jesus of Nazareth, I would leave Him in Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After He was buried in the tomb, He went to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But I have raised Him both from Hades and from the tomb to declare to you that I approve what He did and that I vindicate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, by raising up the Lord Jesus, God silenced those who condemned the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A Proof of Our Justification by God</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The resurrection of Christ, as God s vindication, is a proof of our justification by God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Romans 4:25 says that Christ was delivered because of our offenses and was raised because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The death of Christ fully satisfied God s righteous requirements so that we may be justified by God through Christ s death Rom 3:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His resurrection is a proof that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God because of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Him, the resurrected one, we are accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, Romans 4:25 says that Christ was raised because of our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Suppose Christ died for us and our sins and was buried in the tomb, but was not resurrected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If this were the situation, could you still believe that His death was accepted by God?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Could you believe that His death satisfied God s requirements and fulfilled His desires?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We could not believe this if Christ were still in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, the Man-Savior is not in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God raised Him up from the dead and He came back in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is a strong proof that God has accepted His death for us, that His death satisfied God s requirements and fulfilled whatever God wanted Him to do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Let us use the paying of a debt as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Suppose you owe someone a very large amount of money and are not able to pay the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>However, a wealthy friend of yours intervenes to pay the debt for you, and then gives you the receipt as proof of payment.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When you see the receipt with your creditor s signature on it indicating that the debt has been paid in full, you will be happy, knowing that you have been released from the debt.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As sinners, we were in debt to God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But Christ died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How do we know that God has forgiven us?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We know it by the fact that God raised Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Christ s resurrection is for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>How do we know that God has justified us, that He has accepted us?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We know this by the fact that God has resurrected Christ from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The resurrection of Christ is the proof of our justification by God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The resurrection of Christ is a strong proof that God s requirements have been satisfied by Christ s death and that God has accepted Christ as our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Christ s resurrection is the receipt, the proof, that our debt has been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Praise the Lord for the receipt of the resurrected Christ!</S>
