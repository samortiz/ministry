[1]  CHAPTER ONE BEING RENEWED DAY BY DAY Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:16, 10-11; Titus 3:5b; Eph 4:23; 5:26; Matt 26:29; 1 Cor 11:27-31; Matt 18:21-22, 35; Eph 4:32; 5:2; Matt 5:23-24
[2]  In this message we want to see the renewing process that we need to pass through in our Christian life for God s purpose.
[3]  Second Corinthians 4:16 says that our inward man is being renewed day by day.
[4]  The life described in this Epistle is a life full of sufferings, but when we spend more time to get into the depths of this Epistle, we can see that it is actually talking about renewing.
[5]  All the sufferings God has assigned to us have one unique purpose to renew us.
[6]  Regardless of whether we are good or bad, we are the old creation, but God in His economy desires to work out something new from His old creation.
[7]  After the Lord s second coming, He will set up God s government on this earth to practice God s kingdom in its manifestation for one thousand years.
[8]  When I was a young Christian, I thought that God would bless us by giving us many good things since we had become His children.
[9]  Some preachers promise people that if they believe in Jesus Christ, they will not only be saved but also receive many blessings.
[10]  Our little children are precious to us, but those of us who have had children and who have watched our children grow into adulthood can testify that our children have brought us more suffering than joy.
[11]  OF THE DIVINE LIFE IN RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 4:16; Rom 6:4-5; Phil 2:12-15; 3:10
[12]  Anything created by God that does not have God in it as its life, nature, appearance, and expression is old, but anything that has God within it as its life, nature, appearance, and expression is a new creation.
[13]  In the sense of being in Christ, we are the new creation, but in actuality in our daily life, we are not that new because we do not have Christ as the only One that occupies us, that fills us up, and that is our life, nature, appearance, and expression.
[14]  After regenerating us, God has to renew us, sanctify us, transform us, conform us to His image, and glorify us.
[15]  We may be good saints in the church who have been kept and preserved by the Lord, but have we been renewed with the divine element?
[16]  Is there some renewing going on with us, or are we remaining the same day by day and year after year?
[17]  In order to consummate His renewing work in us and with us, God becomes our life and nature within.
[18]  God s intention is not merely to chastise or correct us, but to use the outward environment to trouble us, to remind us, and to wake us up to realize that we have God as our nature, yet we do not live Him according to His nature.
[19]  Then when we are going to discipline our children, we will consider whether we are disciplining them in ourselves or with God and through God.
[20]  When God is added into us, He does not just remain there, doing nothing.
[21]  Moment by moment we have to receive God so that He can be added into us, and we have to reject ourselves to receive the death of Christ so that we can cooperate with the Lord within us.
[22]  When we experience God in Christ daily, we will see that God s intention is to renew us bit by bit, especially to renew our habit.
