   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LIVING CREATURES HAVING FOUR FACES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Each of the four living creatures has four faces.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we saw someone with four faces, we would be frightened, yet this is exactly what we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all need to have four faces.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Face of a Man</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first face is the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are men, and because we are men, we should look like men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We were created as men, but we were corrupted, poisoned, and damaged by the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we need the Lord s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the Lord s redemption we are brought back to the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, the humanity we have now is not ours but His, for we have the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some say that it is difficult to be a man and claim that they are disgusted with being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have this attitude toward their humanity need to see that their concept is absolutely different from the Lord s concept in His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord s salvation is to make us proper men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are a husband, the Lord s salvation is to make you a proper husband.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you are a wife, the Lord s salvation is to make you a proper wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are a parent, the Lord s salvation is to make you a proper parent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are a child, the Lord s salvation is to make you a proper child.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord s salvation is to make us proper human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we all should bear the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, some Christians, especially certain sisters, do not seem to be human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, they are so spiritual that it seems that they have become strange creatures half human, half angel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not prefer to be something else, and we should not pretend to be something else.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should just be what we are a man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead of trying to be something other than a human being, we should simply be human.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we should be human not by our natural humanity but by the humanity of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we read the four Gospels again, we will see that Jesus was a person with a proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many who read the Gospels only pay attention to the miracles worked out by the Lord in His divinity; they do not pay adequate attention to the things worked out by the Lord s humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, John 4 relates how the Lord Jesus was traveling with His disciples to a city in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was tired and thirsty, and He asked His disciples to go into the city to buy something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After they went away to buy food, a Samaritan woman came to draw water from the well near which the Lord Jesus was sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although He was the Almighty God, in this situation He conducted Himself just like an ordinary man, without any indication or hint that He was God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When He asked the woman for water, He gave no indication that He was anything more than a man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The woman questioned Him, saying, How is it that You, being a Jew, ask for a drink from me, who am a Samaritan woman? v. 9 . He responded to her question in a very human way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The four Gospels record many similar stories which show us how the Lord Jesus behaved Himself like a normal man, bearing the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Unlike certain religious people today who dress in way that is very strange, the Lord Jesus did not dress in a peculiar manner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In His clothing He was not strange or different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the contrary, His living was that of an ordinary human being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His living was ordinary to such an extent that some would say, Is not this the carpenter s son?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matt 13:55 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the eyes of the people, the Lord Jesus was the son of an ordinary carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Far from being strange, He was an ordinary man and He bore the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today, we too need to bear the face of man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some believers have the thought that once they begin to pursue the Lord, they should be special or different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to realize, therefore, that we should be ordinary, that is, we should be the same as common, ordinary human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although we pray, read the Bible, attend the meetings, and serve God, our appearance is still the appearance of a man, and our face is the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In our dress we are proper, but we are ordinary, not peculiar or eccentric.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yes, we experience the Lord as the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum, but the issue of this experience is that we bear the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As living creatures, we are not angels but are very human.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In fact, the more spiritual we become, the more normal and human we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more we have of Christ as our life Col 3:4 , the more we will bear the face of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Epistles we are taught by the apostles to be proper human beings, in particular how to be proper husbands, wives, and parents Eph 5:22 6:9; Col 3:18 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God s salvation causes us to be proper men for His manifestation, move, and administration.</S>
