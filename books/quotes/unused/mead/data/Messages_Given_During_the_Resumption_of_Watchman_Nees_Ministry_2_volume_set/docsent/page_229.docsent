   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Caring for the Poor</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being the Lord's Commandment</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Among us there are three kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first is the sinners, the second is the new believers, and the third is the poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is never free from having a relationship with the poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If anyone feels happy about offering money to the Lord, while unhappy to give money to the poor, he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is wrong to leave the ointment in the alabaster box; we should offer it up to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is right for us to take care of the Lord and His work first.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But after the alabaster box is poured out, the Bible tells us to sell everything we have and give it to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Caring for the poor is also a commandment of the Lord Luke 12:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>of the Church in the Time of a Revival</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In church history, we see that whenever there was a revival, there was the practice of caring for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Strictly speaking, it is a small thing for a poor person to eat more or eat less, to have more clothing or less clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it is a serious thing for a Christian to become narrow in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you want to spend all your money and do not want it to become a hindrance to you, the way is very simple; all you have to do is to catch the time of a church revival and go to the Lord and offer up all you have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you do this, your money will not become your hindrance any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Caring for the Poor</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being Also the Normal Work of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Caring for the poor is not just the work of the church at the time of a revival; it is also a normal work of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is part of a Christian's daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We hope that the brothers and sisters would go home and bring back what you have to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We want everything, new and old.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have brothers and sisters who can wash, sew, and mend these things, and who can distribute them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every time the church receives some money from the offering box, it should set aside a certain amount for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need one brother and one sister who are designated for this relief work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is good if some can give good messages.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if you cannot give a good message, it is equally good if you can give away your belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to learn to be those who are led away to the lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the ones who receive our help are saved, that is an additional blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But even if they are not saved, you will still receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the things in the brothers' and sisters' homes that they do not need should be sent away to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If your house is cleared of all these things, you may end up having fewer burdens to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people may have their backs bent over by the burden of these things already.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE ARRANGEMENT OF PERSONNEL</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to make some announcements concerning the arrangement of personnel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel work...Second, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the gospel visitation work...Third, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the new believers' meetings...</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Fourth, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of the visitation of the new believers....Fifth, we hope that the following brothers and sisters will bear the responsibility of caring for the poor...If there are other arrangements, we will notify the brothers and sisters through printed circular letters.</S>
