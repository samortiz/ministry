   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Symbolizing the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This golden lampstand has more to it than its outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Otherwise it would not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Its inner content is what makes it shine.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In actuality the lampstand is a portrayal of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The doctrine of the Trinity is not specifically described in the Bible, but that God is triune is made quite clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our God is one; He is also three.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the unique God, but He is also Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must be careful in our choice of terms here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To say that God exists in three Persons is misleading.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is better to avoid the word Persons and simply say that He is three in one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is what triune means; it is of Latin origin, tri meaning three and une meaning one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is the aspect of the one and also of the three.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the one hand, the Bible, in both the Old and the New Testaments, tells us clearly that God is one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 86:10 says, "Thou art God alone."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Isaiah 45:5 says, "I am the Lord, and there is none else, there is no God besides me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 8:4 tells us, "There is none other God but one."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, there is clear mention of the Father, the Son and the Spirit Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Words cannot satisfactorily explain the mystery of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet the lampstand does give us a picture of it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was to be made all of one piece of pure gold Exo 25:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is only one lampstand for the tabernacle, yet there were seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Looked at as a whole, the lampstand was one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From the top, however, one could clearly see seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was a seven-in-one lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The lampstand was to be made of a talent of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means it weighed about a hundred pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The substance or essence of the lampstand, then, was gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Gold typifies the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Unlike iron, it will not rust or change chemically, no matter where it is put.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's nature is constant, unchanging, eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The gold, then, denotes God the Father as the essence and source.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The gold was made into a prescribed form, which indicated its function.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This form is Christ, who is the image of God 2 Cor 4:4; Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When God created man, He created him in His image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since Christ is God's image, man was created according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In one sense God does not have a physical form, but in another He does have an expression of His image.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ, the beloved Son, is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What function does this form denote?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him" John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another characteristic of this lampstand is its seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These, the Bible clearly tells us, are the seven Spirits of God Rev 4:5 , which are simply the Spirit of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The golden lampstand, then, symbolizes the Triune God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Its essence is the Father, its form is the Son, and its expression is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this first stage, the lampstand represents Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When He was on earth, the nature of God, the Father, was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So was the Father's image, because the Lord Jesus thoroughly manifested Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As He mingled among men, Christ was also the seven lamps shining forth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus Christ is the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God was in Him, upon Him, and was His very essence.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Apart from Him, no one can find God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Symbolizing the True Israelites</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the second stage Israel is the lampstand Zech 4:2, 6, 10b .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Israel is both individual and corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The individual Israelite is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The corporate Israel, God's chosen people, should be like Him, the true Prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the meaning of the name Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It was Jacob who was given the name Israel Gen 32:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In his early years he surely was not a prince of God!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He was a thief!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God spent more than a hundred years working on Jacob, until he was transformed from a thief into a prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Jacob first stole from his brother Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then he stole from his father.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When he had to escape for his life, God spoke to him in a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Jacob's vow in response to God was still in the principle of grasping something for himself Gen 28:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When he lived with his uncle Laban, He still connived to get what he could for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Laban, of course, tricked him in return by forcing him to take Leah when Rachel was the one he wanted to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But then he continued his scheming way by manipulating Laban's flocks so that all the increase would be his.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God's hand was on Jacob year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>One thing after another was taken from him, till he was stripped of everything he valued.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His beloved wife Rachel died.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>His favorite son was apparently killed by wild beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All that was left was Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then even Benjamin was taken from him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the end Jacob stopped struggling and surrendered.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>God had transformed him from Jacob the thief to Israel the prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Such people, who have been transformed into princes, are the true Israelites, standing as a golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is the second stage.</S>
