   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, the church of God has the nature of a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The nature of the ministers should also be of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The foundation of the church is of stone, the building up of the church is of stone, and the service of the church should be of stone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everything should be rock-solid, unshakable, and without any shadow of change.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God cannot use anything flippant, shaky, or unstable in His divine work within the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When something is stable, it is solid and trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When one stone is laid upon another, any unstable piece will endanger the whole structure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If one rock on a stone wall is unsteady, the whole wall will be in danger of collapsing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church of God, we are not the last stones; many more will be built upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church is not composed of thousands of isolated stones; it is composed of stones that are built one upon the other.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The many stones are built up together to become a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the stones are not on top of one another, there is no church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the temple was destroyed, no stone was upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order for the temple to be built, every stone has to be upon other stones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today God is still building; He is still building up many spiritual things, piece after piece.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If one piece shakes, the whole building will be in jeopardy; many lives will be at risk, and God's church will not be able to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why our character must be as solid as stone; it must be stable.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our character is shakable and unreliable, everything that is built upon us will be shakable, and sooner or later everything will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 15:58 says, "Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can go on positively only if we are steadfast and immovable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If our character wavers, being up at times and down at other times, being one way one minute and another way the next, God's work will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some brothers and sisters cannot participate in the Lord's work because they are too unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you build upon something that is unreliable, you may build a little only to find that it has to be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition to being a waste of labor, it is also a waste of time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The amount of building and tearing down may neutralize one another, but the time wasted is irreparable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man is reliable, whatever is built upon him will be reliable, and no time will be wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Any collapse or damage in the work may be remedied by reconstruction, but five, ten, or twenty years may be lost in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This loss cannot be remedied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to pray that God would make us reliable men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may not climb as high as Peter did, because such heights take time to attain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But at least we can be trustworthy and reliable, not building something that has to be torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without such a reliable character, we cannot participate in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we are stable and trustworthy, we can meet the challenge of any responsibility that falls upon our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Otherwise, we will fall asleep when we are called upon to be vigilant.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a man is unreliable, always being up and down, he will fail in the Lord's call for watchfulness and go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When he is tired, he will fall asleep, not caring whether there is a need for watchfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will want eight hours of sleep and will settle for nothing less, no matter how much he is called upon to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He may get his sleep, but he will not realize the loss he has suffered through his sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose you fall asleep when the Lord calls upon you to be watchful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What will you do when the Lord calls you to work?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You will not have any sense of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a man is not stable before the Lord, he is not reliable, and if he is not reliable, he will not have a sense of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When he feels good, he will work more.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When he feels bad, he will go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He will have no sense of responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, stability in our character is a fundamental need in the work; only stable ones can work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They work when they feel like it, and they work when they do not feel like it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They work when the sun shines, and they work when it rains.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They work when they are very happy, and they work when they are very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These are the stable ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Unstable ones are affected by everything; even the weather affects them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If our work is affected by our environment, we have failed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Before Him we must have a strong spirit.</S>
