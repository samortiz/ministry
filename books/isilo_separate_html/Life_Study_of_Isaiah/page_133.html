His Reproductive Resurrection</H2><P>Isaiah 53:10b-12a speaks concerning Christ's reproductive resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Seeing a Seed and Extending His Days,<br>and the Pleasure of Jehovah<br>Prospering in His Hand</H2><P>"He will see a seed, He will extend His days,/And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand" (v. 10b). The seed here is the church, comprising all the believers produced as the many grains by the death of Christ as the one grain and His reproductive resurrection (John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3). He was the one grain who died to produce many grains. Although He died as a single grain, He resurrected with many grains. His resurrection, therefore, was very productive.</P><P>Isaiah 53:10b says not only that Christ will see a seed but also that He will extend His days. Today Christ is extending His days by living in His believers. His believers are His extension. Therefore, we may sing these words: "We are Thy continuation,/Thy life-increase and Thy spread" (Hymns, #203).</P><P>"The pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand" (v. 10c). The pleasure of God is to see many sons born of Him to become the members of Christ, who constitute the church as the corporate expression of Christ. This is the greatest pleasure to God, and it depends altogether on Christ's death and resurrection.</P><P>Verse 11a says, "Because of the travail of His soul, He will see/And He will be satisfied." What will Christ see, and with what will He be satisfied? Christ will see the church and be satisfied with the church, just as Adam saw Eve and was satisfied with her (Gen. 2:22-23).</P><P>Isaiah 53:11b continues, "By His knowledge, the righteous One, My Servant, will justify the many,/And He will bear their iniquities." Christ did not justify us foolishly or blindly but according to His unlimited knowledge. This indicates that to be justified by Christ is a great thing. When He justified us, He exercised His knowledge and considered such matters as how we would be related to God and how we would affect the kingdom of God. After much consideration according to His infinite knowledge and His complete and perfect discernment, He justified us. For Him to justify us means that He accepted us.</P><P>Since Christ has justified us by His knowledge, He surely bears our iniquities. He is responsible for us in the heavenly court. We have a great many sins, but because Christ has decided to justify us, to accept us, He is willing to bear all our sins.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_132.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_134.html">Next</a> </body></html>
