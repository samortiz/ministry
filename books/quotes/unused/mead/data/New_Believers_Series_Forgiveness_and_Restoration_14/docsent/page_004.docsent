   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. God's Discipline</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 34 continues, "His master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a man who has come under God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God delivers him to the torturers until he should repay all that he owes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 35 says, "So also shall My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We hope that no one would fall into God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must forgive our brother from the heart, as God has forgiven us from His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hope all the brothers and sisters will learn to forgive all offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not try to remember the sins of your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not ask our brother to repay us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's children should be like God in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since God treats us generously, He expects us to treat our brothers generously as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>RESTORING THE BROTHER</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not sufficient for us to just forgive our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This only takes care of the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We still need to restore him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the charge in Matthew 18:15-20.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A. Telling the Person</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Matthew 18:15 says, "If your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If he hears you, you have gained your brother."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Offenses occur all the time among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a brother offends you, what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord says, "Go, reprove him between you and him alone."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a brother offends you, the first thing you should do is not to tell others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not tell the brothers and sisters or the elders of the church about it or make it the subject of your conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not the Lord's charge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a brother offends you, the first thing you should do is go to him and tell him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A problem often arises when a brother offends another brother and then the offended brother goes around publicizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He continually talks about it until the whole church knows about it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the brother who supposedly offended him remains unaware of the offense.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such tale-telling is typical of the conduct of a weak person; only a weak one would be so timid as to not talk directly with the offending brother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He would only dare to speak about the matter behind his back; he would dare not speak about it face-to-face.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is an unclean thing for anyone to speak of matters behind others' backs and to spread gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We do have to deal with our brother's fault, but the Lord does not want us to tell others first.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first one who needs to be told is the person who is directly involved, not others.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we learn this basic lesson well, the church will be spared many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How do we tell others?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Should we write a letter to them?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord did not tell us to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord did not say that we should deal with it in writing, but rather by going to our brother and speaking to him face-to-face.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, just as it is wrong to speak about a matter behind someone's back, it is equally wrong to speak about it in front of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The matter should be communicated "between you and him alone."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many children of God fail in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They publicize things before many people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord charges us to speak only when the involved parties are together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, individual sins should be dealt with by the individuals alone; no third party should be involved at all.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to learn this lesson before God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should never say anything behind the back of the brother who has offended us, and we should not speak to him in front of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must point out his fault only when we are alone together.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not have to talk about other things or bring up other problems; we simply need to point out the fault.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This requires grace from God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is one lesson God's children must learn.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Some brothers and sisters may think that this is too troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While this is, in fact, quite troublesome, you cannot be afraid of trouble if you want to walk according to God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you feel that your brother's offense against you is too small to be bothered with, you may feel no need to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If this is the case, there is also no need to tell others about it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you feel that a matter is insignificant, simple, trivial, and unworthy of bringing to his attention, you should not tell others about it either.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should not think that he does not need to be informed but that others do need to be informed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you want to speak of it, speak to him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If there is no need to speak of it, simply keep silent.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is wrong for others to know about something when the offending brother is ignorant of it.</S>
