   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Walking Worthily of the King of Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is not merely a vessel but the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, the present condition of the church does not match this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although we have a royal status, our condition is altogether improper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 45:13 says, The king s daughter is all glorious within the royal abode; her garment is a woven work inwrought with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Head is the king, and the church is the king s daughter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Being the king s daughter implies that she belongs to the king and that she is of the royal family, having a royal status.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A queen, the wife of a king, is also the daughter of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The king governs nations and the queen matches him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Her conduct and behavior must match the king s position of governing the nation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A king might say to his queen, I govern the nation for you, and I head up the nation to you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is not merely the vessel of the Head but also the Body of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today our situation, condition, behavior, and actions do not match our King.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All things have not been subjected under our feet, and we do not exercise much authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have a royal status, but our condition can be compared to that of a beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ the Head is gold, yet the church as the Body is seemingly clay.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not match the Head, and we do not resemble a royal priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we shop at the market, we lose our royal status because we quibble over a small amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must realize that we are members of a royal family and that we have a royal status.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God Leading Many Sons into Glory</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Ephesians 1:22 says that God subjected all things under Christ s feet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This seems to indicate that everything has already been subjected to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, Hebrews 2:8 says, But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Ephesians 1 God caused His power to operate in Christ to raise Him to the heavenlies, to seat Him at His right hand, and to subject all things under His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet in Hebrews 2:10 we do not yet see all things subjected to Him because He must first lead many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The reason that all things are not subjected to Him is that we have not yet entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The sons of God have not yet entered into the freedom of glory; thus, the light of God still is unable to shine forth to all things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, all things are still groaning and travailing in pain, are not in harmony, and are not subjected to the authority of the Head Rom 8:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other words, the bride has not yet made herself ready cf.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>19:7; Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The bride is the city in Revelation; she is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When she is adorned and has the glory that should be hers, the sons of God will have entered into glory, and all things will be subjected under Christ s feet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, all things are subject to the Head through us and to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Head will shine forth through us, and we will reign with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, at present we are still not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we are sons of the Lord of hosts and are of a royal family, our daily living, walk, and behavior do not match the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not a matter of knowledge or doctrine; rather, this is a matter related to even the smallest things in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not be satisfied merely with our royal status; instead, we should allow Christ s life to work in us and allow Him to fully reign in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brother Lawrence is an example of a person who was weighty and noble when people contacted him, despite the fact that he was a cook.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Old Testament, when Pharaoh stood before Joseph, he felt that he was lower than Joseph Gen 41:38-42 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later when the king of Babylon stood before Daniel, he felt inferior to Daniel, because Daniel possessed something that he did not have Dan 2:47-48 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both Daniel and Joseph were on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Egypt God reigned through Joseph and to Joseph, and in Babylon God reigned through Daniel and to Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Through them God was able to subject all things under the authority of the Head, and they were able to enjoy the glory of reigning with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In like manner, when the children of Israel returned from captivity, God s authority prospered among His desolated people through Nehemiah and to Nehemiah Neh 2:3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we allow the glorious life of Christ to live out from us and God s light to shine forth from us, God will cause people to turn to Him through us and to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The matured Jacob in his senior years was such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When Jacob stood before Pharaoh of Egypt, he was more noble than Pharaoh; thus, Jacob blessed Pharaoh Gen 47:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When Jacob was young, he was not an important person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He only knew how to cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Later when he was old, God was able to be expressed and to reign over Egypt through him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that time Jacob caused all things to be subject to the authority of the Head, and he enjoyed the glory with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All things are subjected under the feet of Christ, the Head, through the church and to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the sons of God are brought into glory, God will be the glory and the enjoyment of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In principle, this is our condition today; we can cause all things to be subject to Him and can enjoy with Him the heading up of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>For this, we must first allow God to bring us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to receive the grace of God, we need to grasp the secret that we will all enter into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For us to provide the way for all things to be subject to the Head and for us to enjoy the heading up of all things together with the Head, we must allow God to bring us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Presently we are not able see all things subject to Him, because the sons of God have not yet entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the church is in glory, all things will be subject under the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When the church allows God to live out from within, everything will be to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the church practically expresses God, everything will be under the feet of the Head and under the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He is the Head over all things to His Body the church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The heading up of all things to the church is the purpose that God desires to accomplish, and it is the goal to which the church will ultimately attain.</S>
