   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DEEPER EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now that we have seen the verses related to Christ in 2 Corinthians, we can realize that every aspect in this Epistle is absolutely a matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1 Corinthians we saw that there are four lines: the line of Christ, the line of the gifts, the line of the spirit, and the line of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 2 Corinthians the line of Christ is greatly enriched and developed in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can also see the line of the spirit and the line of the church in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the line of the gifts is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Healings, miracles, speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, and knowledge are not mentioned in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord did use Paul to perform some miracles, but the Lord would not perform a miracle to remove the thorn in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord kept the thorn with Paul so that he might learn to experience the Lord's sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A husband might ask the Lord to change his wife, but the Lord would keep his wife the same so that he might learn to experience Christ as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the Lord changed this brother's wife, there would be no opportunity for him to experience the Lord as the sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you want to have a better wife or the sufficient grace?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord allows our spouse, our children, and our entire environment to trouble us so that we will have the chance to experience Christ as the sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are no miraculous things in 2 Corinthians because this is a book on the deeper experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we are in the elementary stage, we may desire the gifts, but when we are advanced in Christ, we care for the deeper experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second Corinthians does not speak of miracles and gifts increasing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Instead, it speaks of Christ increasing within us all the time through many sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything in 2 Corinthians has been developed in a deeper way, and all of the outward teachings and gifts are over.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am not saying that the gifts are unnecessary or that the teachings are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They are good for the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But once something has been started through the teachings and gifts, you have to be turned from them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Doctrinal teachings and gifts will divide.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If our gifts are steadily increasing, after a short time we will be divided by these increasing gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gifts are good for the start.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But once you have the start through the gifts, you have to be turned to the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 2 Corinthians there are no more gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is just the indwelling Christ to be wrought into us through hardships, trials, troubles, and sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we mean business with the Lord and go along with the Lord, we will experience Him through sufferings, hardships, and trials.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can never be divided by the experience of Christ in the spirit, but it is easy to be divided by teachings and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we pay our attention to increasing the gifts, there is the danger that these increased gifts will become dividers to divide us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the local church can never be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why in 2 Corinthians the gifts are not increasing but they are terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, Christ is developing and increasing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the way that we can have the real growth in life for the local church to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The increase of teachings and gifts is not the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The growth in life is absolutely something of Christ being developed within you and experienced by you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Body of Christ is built up with the increase and development of Christ, not with the increase of doctrine or with the development of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May the Lord have mercy upon us that we would be willing to turn away from the elementary gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The gifts are elementary things good for the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once something has been started, we need to turn away from the start to the real experience of Christ Himself.</S>
