   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO ON KNOWING ROMAN CATHOLICISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we will consider Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We want to expose its idolatry as well as its persecution of genuine believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to help the new ones to know Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Such knowledge will help them know how to deal with it and will save them from much frustration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 17:4 says, "And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we consider today's Catholicism in the light of this verse, we must admit that this woman refers to the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Roman Catholic Church there is purple and scarlet in every corner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The cardinals' robes are scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Catholic Church is full of precious stones, gold, and silver.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The pope has two crowns, one representing his religious power and the other his secular power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both crowns are made of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The one that represents his secular power has one hundred forty-six large diamonds, five hundred forty pearls, and seven levels of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the true picture of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abominations refer to the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Deuteronomy 7:25-26, Daniel 9:27, 2 Chronicles 33:2, and Ezekiel 20:7-8 all say that idols are abominations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Please note the crucial items in Revelation 17:4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, the woman is holding a golden cup.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second, the cup is for serving wine to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Outwardly the cup is golden, seemingly divine.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yet this cup is filled with abominations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These abominations are the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are introduced to all the world for worship by Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Catholic Church worships Mary because all other world religions have goddesses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christianity is the only religion that does not have a goddess.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Roman Catholicism brought in the idea of a "goddess" from paganism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It created Mary as a "goddess" and teaches men to worship her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to know this fact and have to help new ones understand that idolatry is an abomination in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Christian cannot defile himself with any kind of idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE HERESY OF MARY WORSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Mary began to be exalted in the fifth century.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The title "mother of God" was applied to Mary at the time of the Council of Ephesus in A.D. 431.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is a book called The Glories of Mary, written by a bishop called Alphonsus Maria De Liguori, in which he describes in detail how the Catholic Church exalts and worships Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Part I, Chapter VI, Section III of that book says that "Mary is the Peace-maker between Sinners and God."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Chapter II, Section I says "Mary is our Life, because she obtains for us the Pardon of our Sins."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Chapter V, Section I speaks of "The Necessity of the Intercession of Mary for Our Salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Elsewhere it says that those who fail and fall do so because they have not sought the help of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It tells us that "the Holy Church charges all men to reserve a special place of worship for Mary"; a man can receive many things from Mary which he cannot receive from God, because as Chapter VIII, Section I says, "Mary delivers her Clients from Hell."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She has dominion over all the kings of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Chapter VIII, Section III Mary is said to "lead her Servants to Heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one can enter the blessed kingdom except through her.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The way of salvation is open to man only through Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since our salvation lies in the hand of Mary, those who are under her protection are saved, while those who are not will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Salvation is linked to Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To Catholics, Mary is intimately related to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She is eternally grateful to the Son for choosing her to be His mother.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But at the same time, He is eternally grateful to her for giving Him His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has to repay what He owes her by glorying in her and honoring her in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He does this by answering her prayers and requests.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The book also said that Christ's authority has been given to Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to you Mary ."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything including God has to obey Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has subjected the entire church under Mary's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Chapter VI, Section I says that "Mary is an Advocate who is able to save all."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever she decides to do, she is able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It claims that Mary is almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It argues that the authority of the mother is as great as the authority of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the Son is almighty, so must be the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some have even claimed that the whole church is not only under her grace but under her authority also.</S>
