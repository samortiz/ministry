   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE DELIVERANCE FROM MAMMON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND MINISTRY AND AUTHORITY Co-workers' Meeting Date: April 27, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai DELIVERED FROM MAMMON TO SERVE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible assigns mammon a very important position.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mammon stands in opposition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today more people are gained by mammon than those gained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of a hundred people, perhaps eighty are gained by mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Of the remaining twenty, eighteen to nineteen serve both God and mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is difficult to find one in a hundred who truly serves God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mammon gains more souls than God does.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Deliverance from Mammon Being</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>the Basic Qualification for One to Serve God</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Originally, we had no intention during this time to speak about mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were going to look at the matter of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, the fellowship about the Body life led to a second problem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first problem is individualism, and the second problem is mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Individualism frustrates man from serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Mammon also frustrates man from serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a man serves mammon, not only will there be no service to God corporately, but individually he will not be able to serve God either.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can say that deliverance from mammon is the first and foremost condition for one to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a man is not delivered from mammon, he cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Money Being Satan's Means to Unify All Things</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All things are created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God is the unique source of all things; He is above all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When men see all things, they should be moved to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The human mind invented atheism, and it is obviously wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The heavens move men to know God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"All things'' are diverse and complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Satan wants to unify all things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is no way to add up all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, a chair and a table cannot be added together to make one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is an adult plus a child plus a piece of luggage plus a bar of gold plus a piece of land?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They do not add up to one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, if all these things are converted into money, we can add them up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If all things cannot be unified, how can the businessmen do their accounting?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With so many different units, how can one reckon their respective value?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Money is the only means by which we can reckon all things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, a piece of land no longer becomes just a piece of land; it becomes money.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rice no longer becomes just rice; it becomes money.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we add together all things, we end up with a certain amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Revelation 18 tells us that even the human soul can be reckoned with money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When a man sells his time to work for others, he is selling his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For example, when I hire a laborer, I agree ahead of time how much I will pay him for working eight hours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is to buy the human soul with money.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Money can buy us the human soul, and money can buy us all things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God created the earth, yet man divided it up into pieces and reckoned the value of every piece with money.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If man could occupy the land on the moon, he would sell it for money also.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even for airplanes that fly over the earth, man charges people for access to the air space.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps some people think that this is nothing unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But to us and to the Bible, this is very strange.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In six days God created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Can we find out how much money "all things'' are worth?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There are all sorts of things in all fashions and colors.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yet Satan has simplified these things and unified them under money.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is why money is called "the common goods'' in Chinese.</S>
