<h2 class="head1">VIII. 1 CHRONICLES</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles were also one book in the Hebrew Old Testament. It was also divided by the Septuagint. This book has been generally ascertained by many authorities to have been written by Ezra. If we compare the ending of Chronicles and the beginning of Ezra, we can see that the style, the grammar, and the phrases are all very similar and have to be from the same author. Thus, it has been proposed that Chronicles was written by Ezra.] He wrote this book in Jerusalem. The events recorded in 1 Chronicles took place between 1056 B.C. and 1015 B.C.</p>
 <p>B. The subject: The review of the history of the children of Israel for the recovery of the temple and the city.</p>
<p>C. The background: When the children of Israel were coming back to rebuild the temple and the city of Jerusalem, there was a need to review their history. By reviewing their history, the children of Israel would know the Lord, worship Him, and serve Him. Although this book may record many things similar to Samuel and Kings, it has a different view. It uses the word and view of God to explain history.</p>
<p>D. The central thought: The Chronicles, from the beginning to the end, reveal to us the greatness of God and His rightful position in the kingdom of His people. Although the people always departed from Him and rebelled against Him, He still was the Lord ruling over the whole earth (29:11-12). God&rsquo;s way of seeing and explaining things is different from man&rsquo;s way. This book also reveals to us that God cares for those who seek after Him, that He is the One who judges and the One who forgives, that He is the God on the throne in every situation, and that He always gets the glory.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book uses approximately nine chapters to review the genealogy of the children of Israel. This review reminded the people that they were the chosen ones. The record here concerning David is positive. This shows that the Lord has forgiven David of his gross sins. This book gives the returning people a positive view of God. It chronicles David&rsquo;s inauguration and his men of valor, the ark of testimony, the prosperity of the kingdom, his desire to build the temple, and his victory. It also tells us about the purchase of the site for the temple, the preparation of the materials for the temple, the priests and the Levites, and the rulers. Lastly, it tells us about David&rsquo;s will concerning the building of the temple.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) genealogy (chs. 1&mdash;9:34), 2) Saul (chs. 9:35&mdash;10), 3) David (chs. 11&mdash;20), and 4) preparation for the building of the temple (chs. 21&mdash;29).</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. 2 CHRONICLES</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: (see 1 Chronicles).</p>
<p>B. The subject: (see 1 Chronicles).</p>
<p>C. The background: (see 1 Chronicles).</p>
<p>D. The central thought: All those with a living faith and an overcoming living must fulfill the requirement of seeking, believing, serving, and loving the Lord.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: This book recounts the history of Solomon strengthening his kingship, the building of the temple, the dedication of the temple and its acceptance by the Lord, Solomon&rsquo;s deeds, his wisdom and glory, and his death. This book also records the kings of Judah from Rehoboam to Zedekiah and the carrying away to Babylon. Praise the Lord! This book does not end with the carrying away to Babylon. It continues to say that there was a decree by Cyrus, the king of Persia, charging the people of God to go back to Jerusalem to build a house for God.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) Solomon (chs 1&mdash;9) and 2) the kings of Judah (chs. 10&mdash;36).</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. EZRA</h2>
<p>A. The writer(s), the place, and the time: [The book of Ezra was certainly written by Ezra. Ezra was a very learned scribe and priest. He knew the laws of God very well and therefore was also a lawyer. His books were written in Jerusalem.] This book covers the time between 536 B.C. and 457 B.C.</p>
<p>B. The subject: The recovery of the temple by the remnant of the people.</p>
<p>C. The background: The remnant of the people of God, by His grace and sovereign arrangement, returned to their own land from captivity. They had learned a severe lesson during their captivity; that lesson was to forsake idols. They realized that idolatry was the main cause of their kingdom&rsquo;s destruction (Therefore, from their recovery to the Lord&rsquo;s first coming, the Jews did not worship idols). They remembered Jerusalem during their captivity. They refused to enjoy the pleasures of the Gentiles and did not forget their own country. Nevertheless, they did not have much opportunity to know God, serve Him, and understand His laws. They had married heathen wives. The ministry of Ezra was to rebuild the temple and to cause the people to return to God to know Him, serve Him, and read His laws. He also dealt with them concerning their marriage to heathen wives.</p>
 <p>D. The central thought: As children of God, we should pay attention to God&rsquo;s word and His temple and keep the testimony of our sanctification.</p>
<p>E. The general sketch: The Lord fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah. The Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus the king to encourage God&rsquo;s people to rise up from their captivity, go up to Jerusalem, bring up the vessels of the house of the Lord, and build up the temple. Then the remnant, about fifty thousand people, went back. First they built an altar. Then they began to build the temple. Overcoming many hindrances, they continued to build until the temple was completed. There was a second return of about two thousand people. Ezra led the second group. After finding out that the people had married strange wives and had practiced according to the Canaanites, he confessed to God the sins of the people. He spoke to the people and they repented. There was a revival following their repentance.</p>
<p>F. The sections: 1) the first return (chs. 1&mdash;6) and 2) the second return (chs. 7&mdash;10).</p>
