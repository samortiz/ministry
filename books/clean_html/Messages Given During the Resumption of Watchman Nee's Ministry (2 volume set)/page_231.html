These words seem simple. But all those who understand the Bible know that these words are actually not so simple. Here is a person called Jesus, and a city called Jericho. Both words begin with "Je-." The Bible is not an ordinary book. It is a book of classics, and every word in it is full of meaning.</P><P>Who is Jesus? Jesus is not a common person. If you enter Jericho, there is nothing special about what you are doing. But Jesus is an extraordinary person. His entry into Jericho was also very special. Because He was a special person, Jericho became a special place. All the names of places in the Bible have their spiritual significance. Egypt signifies the flesh, Babylon signifies corruption, and Jericho signifies the place of a curse, which is the world. Jericho is a place of a curse, but Jesus came to Jericho. He came to the place of a curse. Is this world a comfortable place? When we were born, each one of us looked wonderful. But by the age of twenty, we do not look wonderful any longer. By the age of thirty, we look worse. When we are old, we eventually lose our breath, and we die and rot away.</P><P>This world is indeed a place of a curse. A flower looks beautiful in the morning, but by the next day it is gone. A house lasts at most for a few dozen years, and it will go into decay. Everything in the world eventually goes into decay and corruption. In addition, there are problems such as famines, wars, pestilences, unemployment, sickness, old age, death, and so forth. Although man can sit in a sofa chair and sleep in a soft bed, and although he can enjoy comfort outside, he has no comfort within. He can neither sit nor sleep in peace. Some people can never put their hearts to rest; they are afraid of death all the time. Only those who put their hearts in the Savior will find peace. You can do your best to dress yourself up, but you cannot do that for over fifty years. In the end, you will still go into the coffin. Some people wish that the sun would not move and that the earth would stand still, so that they could remain young. But when they wake up in the morning and look into the mirror, they cannot help but find more gray hairs and wrinkles. This is the world today. It is a picture of a place of a curse.</P><P>You are one who lives in Jericho. What about the Lord Jesus? He is the One who "entered" Jericho. He did not originate from Jericho; He "entered" it. He came to Jericho from heaven. Hallelujah! He came from heaven to earth. He came from heaven to the place of a curse, the city of Jericho.</P>
