   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE PERSONS AND THREE LIVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to consider the law of good in our mind, the law of sin in our members, and the law of life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the garden of Eden there were two trees the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these two trees we see good, evil, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With each of these there is a law: the law of good, the law of evil, and the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are a miniature garden of Eden because the triangular situation involving God, man, and Satan is now within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the law of good, the law of evil, and the law of life are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As far as persons are concerned, there are just three beings in the universe: the divine person, God; the evil person, Satan; and the human person, man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each of these persons has a life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The divine person has the divine life, the human person has the human life, and the evil person has the evil life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our human life does not come merely from our parents; it comes from God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our human life was created when Adam was created, not when we were born of our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After his creation, man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the time of the fall, an evil life was injected into man s body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we have pointed out, in the fall not only did man do something wrong, but something evil entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, if a child drinks poison, not only does he do something wrong, but something gets into him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the fall the evil life of Satan came into man s body, and now this evil life is in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, everyone, no matter whether he is a gentleman or a robber, has the human life, which is good, and the satanic life, which is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the reason that people can be both good and evil, both kind and devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one likes to do evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But within us there is a person with a life that likes to do evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, Paul said, For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil I do not will, this I practice 7:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that it is no longer we who do certain things; rather, it is an evil person with an evil life within us who does those things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every human being is not only a son of Adam, but also a child of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 8:44 the Lord Jesus told the Jews, You are of your father the devil, and it is your will to do the desires of your father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone has two fathers, a human father and Satan as a father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day after I had given a message on this matter in Shanghai, a brother asked me to stop saying that we are children of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Telling him that this did not originate with me, I referred him to 1 John 3:10, which speaks of the children of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since we are children of the Devil, then certainly the Devil must be our father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the reason the Lord Jesus said that the Jews were of their father the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, all fallen human beings have two fathers, each with a different life, the human father with the human life and Satan as their father with the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise the Lord that our history does not stop with the creation and the fall!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have been saved and regenerated, born again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Nicodemus thought that being born again was to enter into his mother s womb and to be born, the Lord Jesus answered that to be born again is to be born of the Spirit: That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, to be born again means to be born of God John 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hallelujah, a third person, even God Himself, has been born in us!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With this divine person we have the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first person, the human person, is our being, our self.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This person is in our soul, which is represented by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The life of this person is primarily in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The second person, the satanic person, is in our body, that is, in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But praise the Lord that the third person, the divine person, is in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As we all know, man has three parts: a spirit, a soul, and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In our soul we have the human person, in our body we have the satanic person, and in our spirit we have the divine person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christians are complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When I was young, I was taught that believers have two natures, an old nature and a new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later I learned that this understanding is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every genuine Christian has three persons with three lives.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God, Satan, and the self are all in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes these three persons fight with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is impossible for them to be in harmony or have any fellowship.</S>
