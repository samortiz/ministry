   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 "I pray you, swear unto me by the Lord, since I have showed you kindness, that ye will also show kindness unto my father's house, and give me a true token: and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death" Josh 2:12-13 .</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the story of the salvation of Zaccheus the tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this story, what the Lord did was to stay in Zaccheus's house, and what He said was that today salvation had come to this house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is evidence that the family is the unit of the salvation brought in by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Cornelius led not only his whole family but also his intimate friends to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This coincides with what was mentioned before, that is, that an entire Israelite household should share the Passover lamb with their neighbor.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is Joshua's last declaration to the children of Israel before his death, which not only indicates that he and his entire house are the object of God's salvation but also reveals the result of God's salvation with the family as a unit, that is, that he and his house will serve Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May this also become the desire of each one of us before God and our declaration to the whole universe.</S>
