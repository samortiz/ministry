   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. The Question</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Daughters of Jerusalem 6:1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 6:1 says, "Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After hearing her testimony, it is natural that the daughters of Jerusalem would want to pursue after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see a person in the new creation, who is being filled with the freshness of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Christ she knows is very different from the Christ that others have preached according to their own ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is no wonder that there is power and attraction, and no wonder that they still consider her as the fairest among women and join her in seeking after Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since He is so lovely, where is He now?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is what the questions imply.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The repeated question which they pose, "Whither is thy beloved turned aside?", implies that a barrier exists between the maiden and her Beloved and that this is the reason He has turned aside.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since she knew of His loveliness in the past, and since they are ready to seek Him, she should be able to tell them where He is now.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the implication of their words.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have a sense that when she speaks of her Beloved, it is different from when others speak about their beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>J. The Maiden's Reply 6:2-3</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 2 says, "My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Originally, the maiden sought help from the immature women, hoping that their beseeching would lead her to the place of her beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But after she presents her own testimony and after her attempt to help others, she suddenly receives light and the location of her beloved becomes clear.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She can now say, "My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The garden, which belongs to Him, is just herself 4:16 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She suddenly becomes clear that He has never left.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She does not need to ascend to heaven or descend to Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord is near her, even in her mouth and in her heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although He seemed to have turned away when she delayed in her obedience, actually He only retreated from her feelings; He is only showing her the pain of the withdrawal of His countenance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In reality He is still within her.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no need for her to be in a state of panic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All that she has to do is to open herself to her Beloved, on the one hand, and confess her own failures and ask for forgiveness, on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As to the feeling of His lost presence, she should hold onto God's word with a calm mind, and she should believe that He is still within His garden and prepared to reveal Himself at the proper time once again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although there is still a sense of rebellion and apparent estrangement, she should nevertheless rest on God's word and immerse herself in such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She should realize that God's faithfulness is surer than her own faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No fleshly pursuit will bring about her recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times, it will only bring more confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The inactivity of the believers often causes them great harm.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yet their fleshly pursuit often leaves behind large scars as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the way to recovery does not lie in these ways.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way to the maiden's recovery is first her testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>She does not stop testifying faithfully for the Lord just because she thinks that she is not faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without realizing it, she is attracted by God to turn away from herself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, she can say such things about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is her way of "looking away unto Jesus" Heb 12:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In thinking about His person, grace, work, faithfulness, and love, she subconsciously recovers the light she had lost.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>While she is near the point of despair, she tries her best to help others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although she feels that she has lost the fellowship herself, she hopes that others would know His preciousness and fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although she speaks of her past revelation, does not the Lord quietly hearken when the saints speak one to another concerning Him?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Naturally, the Lord will reveal Himself to her at these times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although she is hungry, others are hungrier than she is, and when she satisfies others, she spontaneously is satisfied herself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we see how she is being delivered from herself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Her sickness lies in her spiritual darkness and depression.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After she is attracted to turn away from herself, her symptoms go away.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After she is enlightened, she realizes that she is actually speaking to herself when she is speaking to the daughters of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although she senses the estrangement in her feeling, she discovers that during the long period of estrangement, He was still in His garden.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The garden is singular in number, which means that it signifies herself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The gardens that are subsequently spoken of are plural, which signify the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She says that He is in her heart, as well as in all the saints' hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "beds" is also plural, which means the same thing that we previously mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When the expression "bed of spices" was used before, it referred to the two cheeks.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that the Lord is eating His excellent fruits in His garden, and He is also enjoying the beauty of His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is shepherding the believers within their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is gathering the lilies, that is, the pure joy which is of Himself and for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 3 says, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When she sees this, she realizes that although everything has changed, the covenant between her and the Lord has not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now she can say, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When her experience was shallower, she said at the height of her desire for fellowship, "My beloved is mine, and I am his" 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She was filled with a sense of sweetness, and she could not help but proclaim that the Lord was hers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But this is different from what was spoken earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The feelings are not as strong; on the contrary, there are even some insubordinate feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet she still believes deeply that the Lord is in His own garden.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, she can say, "I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The previous basis for her speaking was her feeling, whereas the present basis is her faith.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Her heart has spontaneously turned from herself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He still "feedeth among the lilies" 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Just as He fed the flock before, He is feeding the flock now.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the past, He fed the flock among the lilies; now He is feeding the flock in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>She has learned to look to the ever unchanging Lord instead of her fluctuating feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She does not follow these feelings at ordinary times, but even during times of her own failure, she no longer follows these feelings.</S>
