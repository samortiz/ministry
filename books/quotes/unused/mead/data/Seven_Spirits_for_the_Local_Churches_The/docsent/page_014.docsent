   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE BURNING FIRE AND THE FLOWING WATER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation is the last book in the Bible and the last book to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen clearly that this book is from the seven Spirits to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no doctrine in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a long book with twenty-two chapters, yet there is no doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What then is this book about?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a book about the local churches: John to the seven churches which are in Asia 1:4a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this book for the local churches, the Spirit of God is the seven Spirits before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne v. 4b . Here the sevenfold intensified Spirit is now in the second place of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He was in the third place Matt 28:19 , but now in this book He is in the second place, because the age has been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord has turned the age from doctrine to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So there is no doctrine in this book, but the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have the seven Spirits, we have everything; if we do not have the seven Spirits, we have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TWO THINGS FROM THE THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The seven Spirits are before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Revelation speaks of the throne a number of times.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first occurrence is in 1:4 as we have seen in the above quotation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then 4:5 says, Out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The last is in 22:1: He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is so clear that there are two things that come from the throne of God: one is the burning fire, and the other is the flowing water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no doctrine in this book, but there are the fire and the water.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The fire is the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The seven Spirits of God are the seven lamps of burning fire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What then is the water?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To see this we must turn to the Gospel of the same writer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John s Gospel we are told that the water is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this He said concerning the Spirit 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same Spirit is both the burning fire and the flowing water.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Again I say that there is no doctrine in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we come to this book, we only meet the throne with the fire and the water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fire is to burn us, and the water is to supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On one hand, we need to be burned, and on the other, we need to be supplied and watered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE BURNING FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these chapters we have been much occupied with the matter of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The local churches should not be full of doctrines, but full of burning.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Doctrines only stir up different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a local church is a genuine, proper, normal, and living one, there will be more burning than doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we turn and touch the throne of God, we are burned.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>O brothers and sisters, how much have you been burned?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you say that in the local church here you have received many new teachings, I will be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But if so many of you say, Praise the Lord, I have been burned here!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I will be so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all must be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our opinions must be burned, our different concepts must be burned, and our doctrines and knowledge must all be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The local church must be a burning place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more we are in the local church, the more we should be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I was saved, I attended the meetings of a very strict Brethren group.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seemed that they knew the Bible extensively, so I spent more than seven years with them and received much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then in 1933 the Lord brought me to the local church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I attended the meetings of the church there, I felt ashamed of my dead knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After a few months in the local church, all my dead knowledge was burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more I attended the meetings, the more I was burned.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The local church must be such a refining place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Regardless of what we know and what we are, we all must be refined by the burning fire in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Last year, when a group from some of the local churches in this country was in Taipei, some asked how many who were taking the trip were at one time preachers, ministers, and missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I believe that over thirty arose.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all realized that the most difficult people to deal with in the local church are of this type.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Though we have so many preachers, ministers, and missionaries among us, we do not have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All the problems have been burned away in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The more we touch the local church, the more we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the old doctrines, the old backgrounds, and every kind of oldness will be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the book of Revelation, the fire comes before the water, because at that time the church was degraded.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many negative things had come in, and all of these had to be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Teachings can never do this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only the burning of the seven Spirits can accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Spirit is the sevenfold Spirit in the local churches to do a burning work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we touch the throne, the more we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more we say, O Lord, the more we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more we say, Amen, the more we will be burned, and the more we say, Hallelujah, the more we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To be burned simply means to be rid of all the old things.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we will call, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah! we will sense that we are rid of something.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After a few days we will look back and be disgusted with all the old things we used to admire.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>That is the burning.</S>
