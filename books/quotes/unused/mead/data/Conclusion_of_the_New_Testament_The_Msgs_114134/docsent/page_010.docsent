   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. Before the Foundation of the World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God chose us according to His infinite foresight before He created us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The expression, before the foundation of the world, implies the entire universe, not only the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the universe was founded for man s existence to fulfill God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without such a universe, it would be impossible for man to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man s existence is for the fulfillment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, the universe was founded so that man could exist to fulfill God s eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God chose us before the foundation of the world, that is, before the creation of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates that God s selection was made not in time but in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God foresaw us before we were born and selected us before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Christ</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Ephesians 1:4 we also see that God in eternity chose us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ was the sphere in which we were selected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Outside of Christ we are not God s choice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That They Should Be Holy</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>and without Blemish before Him</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God chose us so that we should be holy and without blemish before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be holy is to be separated from everything other than God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It means to be distinct, different, from all that is not God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the universe God alone is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is different from everything else and is distinct.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, to be holy means to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order for us to be holy, we first need to be separated unto God positionally.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Normally, once a person is saved, he should also be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reason a believer is called a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be holy in the sense of being separated unto God is a matter of position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As believers in Christ, we are separated unto God by the redeeming blood of Christ Heb 9:14 , by the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 6:11; 1 Pet 1:2; Rom 15:16 , and in the name of the Lord Jesus 1 Cor 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be holy means not only to be separated unto God positionally but also to be saturated with God dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is deeper and more subjective than positional sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In subjective sanctification we are saturated with God dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Separation can take place rather easily and in a very short time, but it takes a long time to be saturated with God dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God intends to saturate us with Himself, a process that requires time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He chose us in eternity for the purpose of saturating us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wants to work Himself into our being so that we may be holy, just as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All believers have been chosen by God the Father to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, we are separated unto God; second, we are saturated with God; and eventually we become one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One day, we shall be just like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That will mark the completion of our sanctification, the process that begins with separation, continues with saturation, and is completed with the full redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time, from within to without, we shall be the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We shall be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is for this purpose that we were chosen by God the Father before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 1:4 also says that we were chosen by God to be without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A blemish is like a foreign particle in a precious gem.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s chosen ones should be saturated only with God Himself and have no foreign particles, such as the fallen natural human element, the flesh, the self, or worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is to be without blemish, to be without mixture, to have no element other than God s holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has chosen us to be so holy and so pure that we shall be without blemish, without any foreign particles, having only the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We shall be holy and without blemish before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that we shall be holy and without blemish in the sight of God according to His standard.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This qualifies us to remain in His presence and to enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We shall be holy and without blemish not according to our standard or in our own sight, but according to God s standard and in His sight.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Predestinated by God the Father</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In eternity we were also predestinated by God the Father Rom 8:29b; Eph 1:4b, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Greek word translated predestinated in Ephesians 1:5 can also be rendered marked out beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Marking out beforehand is the process, whereas predestination is the purpose to determine a destiny beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God first selected us and then marked us out beforehand, that is, before the foundation of the world, unto a certain destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all need to have the realization that we have been marked out by God for the accomplishment of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because God has put His mark on us, we cannot run away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We were marked out by God before we were born, even before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since we have been pre-marked, we have no choice except to give ourselves to the Lord for His recovery and even to be beside ourselves for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Other human beings cannot see God s mark on us, but all the beings in the spiritual world can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The angels, the demons, and Satan himself know that we have been marked out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This mark is not merely outward but something very inward.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We are a selected and marked-out people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This was accomplished by God in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because we were marked out by God in eternity, we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>One day we believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It may have been that seemingly we believed in Him for no reason.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The reason we came to believe in Christ is that we were predestinated, marked out beforehand, by God the Father.</S>
