<p>Prayer: Lord, may this meeting afford You another chance to take a further step among us. May You open up the heavens to us and reveal to us Yourself and Your mysteries. Lord, we are gathered together before You. We are fully open to You and are willing to be delivered. We do not want to stay in the same condition as before nor do we want to be satisfied with what we have. Lord, take us on and open up the light in Your word to us once again. May You stir us up and kindle us from within that we would not stay the same. Lord, we also pray for every brother who is taking the responsibility of the eldership here. May all of their spirits be burning and on fire. May they desire to have more and more experience in the new way, to taste more of Your riches, and to behold more of Your glory. Lord, give us the clear leading of what You want to speak and what You want to fellowship. Cleanse us again with Your precious blood, and anoint every one of us with Your rich anointing. Amen!</p>
<p>When we came into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, from the beginning we saw clearly that God&rsquo;s intention is for all His people to fulfill the duty of the priesthood. In the Old Testament, God saved the children of Israel out of Egypt, saying, &ldquo;I bare you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you unto myself....and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation&rdquo; (Exo. 19:4, 6). God&rsquo;s desire was for the nation of Israel to be a kingdom of priests in which every individual was a priest. Unfortunately, due to their rebellion and failure, most of the Israelites lost the priesthood. Originally, God ordained that the whole nation of Israel were to be priests. Later, only the house of Aaron became the priests. Those of the tribe of Levi were made only helpers to the priests in miscellaneous affairs. Because of this, in the Old Testament there was a separation between the clergy, which were the priests, and the ordinary people.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, we see in 1 Peter 2 that &ldquo;you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession&rdquo; (v. 9). Revelation chapter one also says clearly that &ldquo;[He] loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood, and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father&rdquo; (vv. 5-6). We who are saved and are cleansed by the precious blood of the Lord are separated by God specifically to be His priests. For this reason, in the New Testament, God reiterated His intention to make every one of His children a member of the priesthood. Unfortunately, the failure of God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament was repeated by His people in the New Testament. In the Old Testament, the people of Israel lost the priesthood due to their failure. As a result, God had to change His way of making the whole nation the priests to one of making the house of Aaron the priests. In the New Testament age, the separation between the clergy and the laity has gradually become a custom and a tradition. This is something man-made and is not pleasing to God. In Christianity today, the terms <em>clergy</em> and <em>laity</em> are very frequently used and are subjects which are often talked about by people.</p>
<p>We have inherited from the British Brethren the light concerning the practice of the universal priesthood. Fifty or sixty years ago when we began meeting, the universal priesthood was not too common among us. Gradually, there was a little improvement. But during the past years, the practice has declined again. Using the church in Taipei as an example, those who actually function in the priesthood are less than one third in number. Most of what we call church services are just works of the Levites. These works include cleaning, serving the bread and the wine at the Lord&rsquo;s table, ushering, and other practical affairs. They are not the work of the priesthood, in which one contacts God directly and offers up sinners. Of course, the Levitical service is necessary also, but it is not the focal point of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The service in the New Testament is almost entirely on the spiritual side and is of life. There is not much said about practical affairs. From the beginning we have seen this clearly, and the co-workers have been faithful in holding fast to this. They try their best to encourage the brothers and sisters in order to stir up the gifts within them that everyone would fulfill the function of the priesthood. In the Old Testament, the most important duty of the priests was the offering of the sacrifices. The sacrifices were offered in the outer court. After the priests completed the work of offering the sacrifices, they entered into the Holy Place to take care of the showbread, to light the lamps, and to burn the incense. In addition to this, the high priest had to enter into the Holy of Holies once a year. All these types are very clearly seen in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>I have studied the Bible for many years and have expounded the types many times. It has always been unclear to me how the Old Testament priesthood is to be applied to the New Testament and what the New Testament spiritual sacrifices actually are. It was not until recently that I was enlightened by two passages in the Bible concerning these matters.</p><h2 class="head1">JOHN THE BAPTIST REJECTING<br />
THE OLD TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD AND<br />
TURNING TO THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>One of these passages concerns John the Baptist. John was born into a priestly family. His father, Zachariah, was a chief priest, one who took the lead in the priestly order. John was born a priest, yet he did not fulfill his function in the temple. Instead, he went to the wilderness. He did not wear the priestly garment nor did he eat the priestly food. Rather, he had camel&rsquo;s hair for dress and ate locusts and wild honey. He went to the wilderness and told people, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). This is how a New Testament priest begins. The duty of a New Testament priest is to offer up sinners. John was a priest, being born into a priestly family. Yet the age had changed. He would no longer be a priest of the Old Testament; he came to be a priest of the New Testament.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, the first one to fulfill his ministry was John. The second One was the Lord Jesus. In John chapter three it says, &ldquo;After these things, Jesus and His disciples came into the land of Judea; and there He stayed with them and baptized. And John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and they came and were baptized....John&rsquo;s disciples...came to John and said to him, Rabbi, He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him. John answered and said, A man can receive nothing unless it has been given him from heaven. You yourselves testify of me that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before Him. He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. He must increase, but I must decrease&rdquo; (vv. 22-30). My point is to show you that John came out to be a priest of the New Testament age. What he offered was sinners. He was not the High Priest. The High Priest was the One who came after him. He was only a priest helping the High Priest offer up the sinners.</p>
<p>The other passage is in Romans chapter one where Paul said, &ldquo;I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son&rdquo; (v. 9). The word &ldquo;serve&rdquo; in the original language has the sense of a service in worship. Paul considered his preaching of the gospel not only a work but a service and a worship to God. After he preached the gospel and saved the sinners, he offered up these sinners. Hence, in Romans 15:16 he said, &ldquo;That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DUTIES OF THE PRIESTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Offering Sacrifices</h2>
<p>What then do the priests of the New Testament do? How can all the brothers and sisters be priests? We know that the most important work of the New Testament priests is to offer the sinners to God at the altar of the cross. Our preaching of the gospel is to bring the sinners in and to offer them up. This offering up is mentioned in a simple way in the book of Romans. There Paul said, &ldquo;I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (15:16). The offering in Colossians, however, is not that simple. &ldquo;To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the nations, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory: whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ&rdquo; (1:27-28). The offering here is presented by making the nations know that with God&rsquo;s mystery there is a glory. This glory is Christ in them as the hope of glory. They must be this kind of people. Only then can they be offered up as offerings to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Arranging the Showbread, Lighting the Lamps,<br />
and Burning the Incense</h2>
<p>The type in the Old Testament is very clear. In the outer court, there was the offering of the sacrifices. In the Holy Place, there was the arranging of the showbread, the lighting of the lamps, and the burning of the incense. The showbread is for the supply of life, the lamps are for the releasing of light, and the burning of the incense is for the intercession for men. The presenting of every man full-grown in Christ is the perfecting in Ephesians 4. The perfecting will qualify one to be presented full-grown. Hence, the offering at the altar in the outer court in Romans 15 is the initial offering. The offering in the Holy Place through the showbread, the golden lampstand, and the golden altar in Colossians 1 is the progressive offering.</p>
<p>In building up the small groups, we are warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ. This presenting is the work of the priests. In order that all the brothers and sisters may function in the priesthood, there is the need of bringing every brother and sister into the service of the gospel so that everyone would have a share in the gospel. Only then will the service among us be a universal priesthood with everyone serving.</p>
<p>The first step of the new way is for everyone to preach the gospel. The work of the evangelists in Ephesians 4 is not mainly a work of preaching but a work of perfecting the saints. This is like a teacher teaching his students. When the saints are perfected, every one of them will become priests of the New Testament. The work of the New Testament priest is to build up the Body of Christ. One item in this work is to gain the sinners and to minister Christ into them so that Christ within them would become their eternal hope. These ones will then become the offerings for God in the hands of the evangelists. Paul was such a priest of the gospel. He brought in the Gentiles, offering them up as sacrifices, and was an example to these saved believers in everything. He was not kneeling down every day in prayer. Rather, he was bringing in the sinners one by one so that every one of them would have Christ in them as glory and would become acceptable sacrifices in the eyes of God.</p>
<p>After we bring people in, we need to nourish them. Paul said in 1 Thessalonians 2 that he was &ldquo;gentle in your midst, as a nurse would cherish her own children&rdquo; (v. 7). When you look at a nursing mother, you can realize how one should cherish her own child. A nursing mother is not a hired nurse but a child&rsquo;s own mother. When a mother nurses her baby, she puts the baby in her bosom. Hence, she is both the bed and the cradle to the baby. She is even everything to the baby. When the baby is not happy, she would rock the child back and forth. This is what is meant by cherishing. While she is cherishing, she is also nourishing at the same time. After we baptize people, we have to set up home meetings to nourish and cherish them. This kind of nourishing work also should be done by everyone. Only then will the priesthood be universal.</p>
<p>After a person is nourished for a month, he will be somewhat established. By then, he should immediately be brought to the small group meetings to be in touch with other brothers and sisters. This will bring him into a communal life and will usher him into the church life. In the small group meetings, there must not only be the teaching, but there must be the nourishing as well. Moreover, the small groups must be organic. Everyone has to teach, and everyone has to learn. In this way, the Body of Christ will be built. First Corinthians 14 is a chapter specifically on the building up of the church. How can the church be built up? It is built up by prophesying. Paul said, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged&rdquo; (v. 31). &ldquo;But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all&rdquo; (v. 24). We see here that everyone should prophesy. Therefore, the prophesying should also be universal.</p><h2 class="head1">GOING ON TO ENRICH THE CONTENT<br />
OF THE NEW WAY, WITH THE ELDERS<br />
BEING THE KEY TO A BREAKTHROUGH</h2>
<p>We have spent more than four years in Taipei to study the new way. Today we can say that the basic framework is here in the church in Taipei; the church is now on the right track. There is now the basic framework of the gospel, the homes, the small groups, and the districts. But the content must go up to match the basic framework. The key to a breakthrough depends very much on the elders.</p>
<p>Before you practice the new way and have the three levels of meetings in the homes, the small groups, and the districts, you must first be a revived person. In addition to a revival every morning and overcoming every day, you must pray, follow the Spirit, live Christ, and labor diligently. I hope that you would rise up to pick up this burden. The Lord Jesus gave two examples in Luke 14: &ldquo;For which of you, wanting to build a tower, will not first sit down and calculate the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?&rdquo; (v. 28). &ldquo;Or what king, going to engage another king in war, will not first sit down and deliberate...?&rdquo; (v. 31). Both of these examples show that a Christian&rsquo;s life is one that should be planned. How should I conduct my life? Other than my office hours, how much time should I give to the Lord? There must be some form of planning and reckoning. We have lived foolishly for a long time. From now on, we must not be foolish any longer.</p>
<p>As elders, you have a heavy responsibility upon you. There must be planning and reckoning. To work, to raise up a family, and to improve oneself are all necessary occupations. But I also believe in the sovereign hand of our Creator, God, who is arranging all the environments. As long as we work according to the proper principle, we should not have any difficulty. Today you are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. You can no longer be as foolish as you were before. You have to be like Paul who ran not without a direction and who wrestled not as beating the air (1 Cor. 9:26). You must have a goal. Since the Lord has set you in the eldership here in Taipei, you have to treat the matter seriously. You have to pray much before the Lord. If you are not clear yourself, you should seek the fellowship of two or three brothers together. Find out from them what an elder should do. If you would live an overcoming life every day and would touch the Lord every morning, having a fresh beginning every day, and walk according to the Spirit, your time will not be wasted.</p>
<p>Dear brothers, as long as you are willing, there is nothing that is impossible to do. Every week, other than the Lord&rsquo;s Day, you should devote at least two entire evenings for serving the Lord. Either you should go out to preach the gospel by visiting people, or you should go to home meetings or small group meetings. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day, you will invariably meet with the brothers and sisters. In Taipei, most people work during the day and rest during the evenings. In addition, most people have a day and a half rest during the weekend. This kind of arrangement is very suitable for us in order that we might serve the Lord. As long as we would plan a little and devote two evenings out of each week to the Lord, we can surely accomplish something. This is an effective way. We have studied it already, and the basic framework has been set up. The rest depends on you elders.</p>
<p>Now we are very clear that the first work of the New Testament priest is to bring in the sinners and offer them up as offerings. After this, you have to do some fine work, constantly arranging the showbread through the supply of life and dressing the lamps through releasing the truth. The arranging of the showbread and the lighting of the lamps are done in the small groups. In addition to this, you must pray for others. This is what Paul meant in Colossians chapter one when he said that he announced this Christ, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that everyone might be presented full-grown in Christ. If everyone would do this, the result will be a universal priesthood. Everyone should preach the gospel. Everyone should feed the Lord&rsquo;s sheep. Everyone should learn to function and teach in the small group meetings. And everyone should prophesy in the district meetings. In this way, the whole church will be priests, and the clergy will disappear.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE SMALL GROUPS<br />
AND THE PROPHESYING</h2>
<p>We have to cover another point concerning the division of the small groups. It is not easy to group the small groups. If the number increases, it is imperative to subdivide. But it is also important that subdividing not be done too soon. Those who are more experienced should observe closely the actual condition of the small groups. For example, after you preach the gospel and people are saved, you should have three or four people under your care. You should do your best to bring them to the small group meetings. If each one would bring one, eight would bring another eight, and sixteen people would make a good meeting. This way of meeting will enable the new ones to learn. They will not know anything about the religious worship service but will only know how to meet in this kind of organic way. After meeting in this way for three months, more people will be brought in. Perhaps the number will increase to twenty-five. By then, you will have to subdivide. In this subdividing, each group will have some older saints as well as some new ones. Gradually, the groups will repeat the cycle to multiply and spread over and over again.</p>
<p>The most difficult thing to do in the district meeting is to prophesy. All of you have to strive. You must strive to teach and strive to speak. You must seize every opportunity to practice. On Saturday, you should put together the inspiration you received during the daily revival throughout the week and make a composition out of this for your prophesying on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning. This is the right principle. However, you must remember that you cannot speak as long as in a sermon. The best way is to prophesy concerning one point only. In a district meeting on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, if fifteen people would stand up to speak on fifteen points, the meeting will be rich. The leading ones must teach everyone and should correct them. In this way, no one will become lazy among us.</p>
<p>If everyone would be busy preaching the gospel, and if after the babies are born, everyone would be busy nourishing them, and if after they are nourished, every one of them would be grouped into the small group meetings, and if those who have received light, experience, and revelation from the Lord&rsquo;s word would prophesy in the district meetings to build up the church, I believe in one to two years time, a good foundation will be laid. As long as we all would strive, the new way will not only be here with a basic framework but will be rich in its content as well. In this way, the reality of 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 will be fulfilled among us in a living way, and God&rsquo;s goal will be attained.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

</ol>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEWNESS IN NATURE OF THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>Since 1984 we have mentioned the practice of the new way, and about four and a half years have gone by. Everyone has said much about this new way, but I feel that there is the need for further revelation, vision, and light concerning this way. In other words, we still need to see the inward reality of this new way.</p>
<p>Every divine thing in the Bible has its outward appearance and its inward reality. In the same way, when we mention the new way, there is a distinction between its outward aspect and its inward aspect. It is easy for us to just see the outward manifestation of the new way. Whether in the East or in the West, the impression that I have received from most brothers and sisters when they have talked about the new way is that they refer mostly to some outward methods. For example, we used to preach the gospel in one kind of way, and now we have changed the method. According to the understanding of the brothers and sisters, this new method is the new way. Another example is that we used to meet in one kind of way, and now we have changed to meet in another kind of way. Even in our service, we used to have one kind of practice, and now we have changed to another. According to the understanding of the brothers and sisters, all these new methods are the new way. Actually, this kind of understanding is wrong. It is true that in the Old Testament as well as the New, there are definite ways to carry out all of God&rsquo;s commandments and instructions. However, within all the ways there is the inward nature.</p>
<p>For example, here we have a cup. When we see this cup, we realize right away that it is to contain liquid as its content. The way it is shaped tells the nature of the content. Another example is that of shopping in department stores. If you buy a rectangular item, the salesman will surely put it in a rectangular box. Hence, for everything the method must match the inward nature of the thing itself. According to the revelation of the New Testament and our experience of serving the Lord for so many years, we have seen clearly that there are four main points in our service to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR MAJOR STEPS IN PRACTICING THE NEW WAY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>The first matter in the Christian service is the preaching of the gospel. This is like marriage and childbirth. After a young couple become married, the first thing that occurs is childbearing. After a child is born, the center of the family is shifted to the child. If a couple has no child, there is a big lack. Children are the focus of the family. This is true in the West as well as in the East. It is a natural law that God put into man. Praise the Lord that we are all saved today. In other words, we are all married. What ought to follow is childbearing. The spiritual childbearing is the preaching of the gospel. Paul said, &ldquo;For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:15). Paul preached the gospel and led many to salvation. These Corinthian believers then became the spiritual children begotten by Paul.</p>
<p>The Lord told us in John 15:5 that He is the vine and we are the branches. The usefulness of the vine does not lie in its blossoms; it is not for people to appreciate the flowers. Rather, it is for fruitbearing. If a vine does not bring forth fruit, its destiny is to be cut off (v. 2). The meaning of being cut off is not to go to hell, nor to go into perdition. Rather, it means that believers will lose their enjoyment in Christ. Originally you are a branch abiding in the vine. Everything that the vine is and has is your portion and enjoyment. But if you only enjoy and do not bear fruit, you will lose the rich enjoyment of Christ.</p>
<p>It is a terrible thing to be cut off from the vine. The Bible says that the consequence of being cut off is a kind of punishment and loss. To avoid the destiny of being cut off, we must bear fruit. For us who are serving the Lord, the primary thing is the preaching of the gospel. In the long run, the fruit-bearing must be done in an optimal way. There must not be too many or too few; it must not be done too quickly or too slowly.</p><h2 class="head2">Nourishing</h2>
<p>After the fruitbearing comes the nourishing. Every mother knows that the first thing a newborn child does is drink milk. Hence, the first thing a mother has to learn is how to nurse her child. In the past our way has been to invite people to come to the meeting in the meeting hall on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning immediately after we baptize them. We realize now that this method is not so correct. After a child is born, we do not ask him to come to us to be fed. Rather, we have to go to him and feed him with milk. If we cannot go to the homes of the new ones daily, we should go at least once every three days. The best way is to go every day. When we go to the homes of the new brothers and sisters and feed them with spiritual food, this is what we call the home meetings.</p>
<p>Whether in the East or in the West, the churches baptize a large number of people every year. But year after year the church attendance has not increased appreciably. The reason for this is that most of the newly baptized ones soon die. Take Kaohsiung as an example. In 1952 there were sixty people meeting here. By now thirty-seven years have passed. If we use sixty as a base number, and we baptize an average of two hundred per year, we should have brought in over seven thousand. But the number of attendants in Kaohsiung today is only about twelve hundred. Where are the other six thousand? Perhaps they have all died. The reason for this is that after a person is saved, we are zealous to remind him to come to the meetings. If he does not show up this week, we may call him by phone. There is still some zeal within us, but this zeal does not last long. After two or three months no one cares about where these newly baptized ones are anymore. This is why I have said that in the past we begot many, but with the begetting there was no nourishing. Even when there was the nourishing, the nourishing was not done properly.</p>
<p>We make appointments for people to come to the meetings. We use the phone to invite them to come. We even hire taxis to pick them up for the meetings and prepare love feasts for them to attend. All we think about is for them to come, come, come. It never occurs to us that we can also go, go, go. In the past when the new ones came, we considered that they were so obliging and kind to have come to us, that they have done us such a big favor and have so highly honored us! Now why not turn the thought around? Rather than painstakingly inviting them to come, why do we not go to them to do them a favor and honor them? In the future, we have to turn the matter around. We will no longer oblige people to come to the meetings. Instead, we will go to their homes to meet with them.</p>
<p>For example, if ten persons have been baptized, each one of us should claim one of these to care for. It would be best if some would fight for them saying, &ldquo;This one is mine. I want this one!&rdquo; This is a good sign. I hope no one would be so polite as to say, &ldquo;Oh, I cannot do it. You take all of them!&rdquo; Outwardly speaking, this is politeness. But actually, this is going backward. This is to shrink from responsibility. If every one of us would bear the responsibility of nourishing others, I absolutely believe that the newly baptized ones will not die, for they will all be sustained by the home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Teaching</h2>
<p>Concerning the new way, the two words that I like the best are &ldquo;go&rdquo; and &ldquo;home.&rdquo; To go is to beget children, and the home is where the nourishing is done. Both the begetting and the nourishing are important matters. But after the begetting and the nourishing, there is still the need of teaching. Ephesians 4:8 and 10-11 say clearly that the ascended Head in His ascension has given many gifts to men. Some are apostles, some are prophets, some are evangelists, and some are shepherds and teachers. According to man&rsquo;s natural concept, we think that all these gifts are workers sent out to work. For example, the evangelist is naturally one who goes out to travel and to preach. We consider that this work is something which we cannot do. Actually, the gifts that Paul mentions here are for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, and the work of ministry is for the building up of the Body of Christ. In other words, these gifts are for the perfecting of the saints.</p>
<p>Suppose I am a giant in evangelism. When I call a gospel meeting, three to five thousand people would come and listen to me. After the meeting I would have a thousand baptized. How can I take care of all these one thousand by myself? I must start a work similar to what is done in the teachers&rsquo; college, which is to raise up fifty to a hundred students to do the work of nourishing. In the end, I will not be the only one that can beget, nourish, and teach. Instead, fifty, or even five hundred will be raised up. Then everyone will be able to beget, nourish, and teach. This is the perfecting of the saints. The perfecting mentioned in Ephesians 4 is this kind of teaching.</p><h2 class="head2">Building</h2>
<p>We all know that it is easy to beget a child. It is not too difficult to raise him up either. But teaching children takes many months and years. According to the present system of education, a child must receive sixteen years of education. Only after he finishes his college education can he be considered as having successfully completed his training. To be successfully educated means to be perfected. In spiritual education, only when a saint has been perfected to the extent that he can do the work of the New Testament ministry can his education be considered as completed. The work of the New Testament ministry is none other than the building up of the Body of Christ. This is a term that Christianity knows nothing about and is a work that is not found in Christianity, but it certainly is in the Bible. Moreover, the Lord has shown us that when all the saints, old and young, men and women, are perfected, they can all build up the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD IN THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>The building up of the Body of Christ does not depend on a few people. It does not depend on the responsible brothers in a church. Nor does it depend on the co-workers or the full-timers. Rather, every one of the perfected saints should participate in the work of the building up of the Body of Christ. Begetting, nourishing, teaching, and building are the four major steps in the new way. When every one of the saints in the church can beget, nourish, teach, and build, God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is fulfilled. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose is to have the Body of Christ, and the steps to arrive at this purpose are the begetting through the preaching of the gospel, our nourishing through the home meetings, our teaching through the small group meetings, and our building up through the church meetings.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 14:26 says, &ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo; Here God shows us the model for the church meeting. According to Ephesians 5, the psalms are not mainly for singing in the meeting but for speaking. Verse 19 says to speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord. One can see that the hymns are not just for singing or for psalming, but are for speaking one to another. Hence, in the church meeting before we sing a hymn, it is not bad to first spend some time to speak the hymns to one another. There is one kind of taste in singing the hymns, but there is a better kind of taste in speaking the hymns. The speaking of the hymns is a kind of prophesying.</p>
<p>Everyone has a desire to prophesy in the meetings, but many do not know what to speak. The simplest way is to choose a hymn and speak to one another. Every one of our hymns is a revelation and a message. When we exercise our spirit to speak the hymns, we express the content, atmosphere, and spirit of that message. The goal of prophesying is to build up the church which is to build up the Body of Christ. When you speak a little and I speak a little, and when everyone speaks a little, the riches of Christ will be manifested. No matter how well a person may preach, he only expresses his own thoughts. But for everyone to prophesy is to have a love feast in the Chinese style where everyone brings a dish and puts it on a long table. The riches will be exhibited fully before everyone&rsquo;s eyes. In the church meeting everyone must bring forth the riches of Christ, everyone should speak, everyone should listen, and everyone should function.</p>
<p>What God is after today is not a congregation. What He is after is a Body. A congregation is an organization, but a body is not an organization. Rather, it is an organism. The members in a human body do not come about by organization. Rather, they come about organically. In the same way, the church of God does not come about through organization. Rather, it comes about organically. Today&rsquo;s Christianity emphasizes the congregation. As such it is surely an organization. As long as a learned and eloquent speaker comes and speaks persuasively, the congregation is kept together. Once the able speaker is gone, the congregation cannot remain. This is a congregation, an organization. What God is after is not a congregation; He is after a Body. Hence, Ephesians 1:20-23 says that Christ resurrected from the dead and transmitted all the riches of ascension to those who believe in Him. Those who believe in Him are the church, the Body of Christ. For this reason, the preaching of the gospel must be done by every member of this Body.</p><h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel&mdash;Everyone Ought to Go</h2>
<p>Matthew 28:19 says. &ldquo;Go [ye] therefore.&rdquo; The &ldquo;ye&rdquo; here does not refer only to the little company of disciples. It does not refer only to the hundred and twenty who prayed that day at Pentecost in the upper room. Rather, it refers to all those who believe in the Lord. All believers past and present are included in this &ldquo;ye.&rdquo; We who are the disciples of the Lord should all go out. Only then will this match the nature of the Body that God desires. What God is after is not an individual gospel giant but a Body.</p>
<p>Hence, the preaching of the gospel must be done by every member of the Body. This is like my walking. When I walk, not only do my feet walk; my legs, shoulders, head, and even my whole body walks as well. We cannot find any place in the entire New Testament that the Lord charges only a minority of believers to preach the gospel. What we see is that the Lord commands all the believers when He says that &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18-19a). All authority has been given to us. Therefore, when our gospel teams go out to speak to others, they have to be bold. They should not be afraid of heaven or earth. They should be afraid of no one for the Lord Jesus has given us all authority in heaven and on earth! Therefore, every one of us can preach. No matter who we see, we can tell them boldly, &ldquo;Repent, and believe in Jesus!&rdquo; This is the organic functioning and the organic move.</p>
<p>Gospel preaching in Christianity is not an organic move. Rather, it is an organizational movement. Pastors are hired to come and preach while all the other believers rest and listen. This is organization. Today we are the members of the Body of Christ. All the brothers should go and preach the gospel. All the sisters should also go and preach the gospel. Everyone should go and preach the gospel. If we do this, this will match the nature of the content of the New Testament. Let me say again that the content of the New Testament has nothing to do with a congregation, a denomination, or an organization. What God is after is a Body. In the matter of preaching the gospel, all the members of the Body of Christ with no exception should preach and should move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Meeting in Homes and Groups&mdash;<br />
Everyone Should Participate</h2>
<p>Not only should everyone preach the gospel, they should all participate in home meetings and group meetings as well. All the elders know that, on the one hand, they wish that there could be as many people as possible in their church. On the other hand, they are afraid that there would be too many people. This is because the more people there are, the more problems there are, and often it becomes impossible to take care of all the problems. Formerly we used to set up leaders to take the lead. These leaders then became another kind of pastor and preacher. This way does not match the nature of God. Now every one of us is a leader. For example, if a small group has fifteen people, all fifteen come to speak and to learn. While others are speaking, I am learning, and while I am speaking, others are learning. If there are some mature ones in the small group, there is all the more reason for everyone to learn. Eventually, it will not be only one that is teaching; instead, everyone will teach. This is what is meant by everyone participating in the home and group meetings.</p>
<p>If five hundred people are baptized today, immediately we should have five hundred brothers and sisters come forward to claim one baby each. Although they may not be begotten through you, yet when you claim them for your own, it is as if you had begotten them. After being nourished for six months, these new ones become stabilized. You will then lead them to the small group meetings so that they will get acquainted with those in the small group. In this way, gradually they will also know how to care for people and help people. When they see you praying and caring for people and meeting their need, they will learn to do the same. This is like a big family where the younger brothers and sisters learn to do what the older brothers and sisters do. When we establish a model in the group meeting, the newly baptized ones will find many lessons to learn. This is to have all the members function together. A small group where all the members function together becomes a body. Whenever the church moves, all the members act together in coordination as one body.</p><h2 class="head2">Prophesying for the Lord&mdash;<br />
Everyone Is Able</h2>
<p>The preaching of the gospel is for everyone. The home and group meetings are also for everyone. Likewise, prophesying is also for everyone. When everyone comes together, all speak. Whatever task we set about to do, it is always difficult before we do it. But after we make up our mind to do it, we will joyfully bear the responsibility. Our daily responsibility as a Christian is to practice these four major steps of the new way. Knock on doors to preach the gospel and beget spiritual children; everyone has to do this. After a child is born, everyone has to bear the responsibility of nourishing. There must be not only the nourishing, but also the teaching. After teaching there is still the perfecting, and after the perfecting there is still the prophesying. It seems as if all of these four steps put a demand on people. But if you do not do them, it would be hard for you to be a member of the Body of Christ in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The question is: what kind of Christian do you want to be today? Do you want to be an overcomer, or do you want to be a loser?</p>
<p>The new way that the Lord has shown us is a way ordained by Scripture. Everything that He commands us to do matches the nature of His Body and the principles of the Body. Either we forget about the preaching of the gospel, or we have to do it together as a Body. In the same way, we either forget about the home meetings, or everyone has to do it together. Even if you cannot take care of two each week, at least you can take care of one every two weeks. To care for some is always better than not caring for any! A church where everyone is functioning will not only beget new ones, but it will also retain, sustain, and maintain them. In caring for the new ones there is the need not only to support them spiritually and in prayer, but also the need to care for them physically and in their employment. This is the way to perfect people. In the end everyone will become children of a well-educated family. Everyone who is brought up in this church will be able to preach the gospel and to care for new ones. They will all have home meetings and will be able to care for new ones. They will also be able to have small group meetings to keep and perfect the new ones so that all will be built up together. Eventually, everyone will be able to prophesy. As long as we are willing to practice these things and the more we do them, the more we will become capable and skillful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE TAKING THE NEW WAY TO ACCOMPLISH<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>I hope that all the brothers and sisters would see that these words are all according to the truth in the Bible. The Bible tells us that to preach the gospel, we do not gather the people to us; rather, we go to them. The Lord has not sent us to remote Africa. As long as we will knock on our aunt&rsquo;s door, it will be open to us. There is also our uncle&rsquo;s door on which we have to knock. After the close relatives there are still the distant relatives. Besides these, there are still our classmates and colleagues. When your aunt is saved, she still has her aunts also. There is no end to this kind of preaching.</p>
<p>If you would pick up the burden for the gospel in an aggressive way, not only will you be able to taste the joy and blessing of salvation in this age, but also in that day when you meet the Lord there will be a large group of people behind you. They will all have been saved through you. By then you will surely be exceedingly happy. On the contrary, if you preach to no one today and will not save anyone even when you see them dying, you will have a difficult time facing the Lord. By then there will be no chance for you to do it again. The Lord warns us in Matthew 24 that if we eat and drink with the drunken and the evil slaves, in an hour which we know not, the Lord will come and cut us asunder and will appoint our portion with the hypocrites (vv. 49-51).</p>
<p>In His New Testament economy, God desires to have a Body. This Body must have new ones. We hope that there will be more and more new ones added to the church. By this the meetings will be higher and richer. To achieve this, every member has to function. Everyone has to go out to preach the gospel. After people are baptized, everyone has to nourish. Do not be afraid that your legs will be tired of going to the home meetings. Every one of us should go out to establish the new ones and bring them to the small group meetings. After this we should bring them to the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meetings so that they would be cared for and perfected. After half a year, those who are under your care will be able to do the same thing that you do. By then you can divide the small group and renew the cycle all over again. Go out again to knock on doors and bring people to salvation. Set up more home meetings and group meetings. By going on continuously in this way, the church will have the increase and spread.</p>
<p>The new way is not just a method; it is a matter of nature. The nature of the new way is to bring God into man to be mingled with man that man may become the Body of Christ. To arrive at this point we must gain the new ones, feeding them and leading them to prophesy. Outwardly speaking, all these are methods. But these methods match the inward nature of the new way. Today whether it is preaching the gospel, nourishing others, attending home and group meetings, or prophesying in the meetings, all are moves of the Body. In the end the Body of Christ is produced and God&rsquo;s New Testament economy will be accomplished.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

	<li>Everyone prophesying for the Lord&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26, 31.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>We have seen that God&rsquo;s ordained way always matches the nature of the things He desires to do and accomplish. In the New Testament, God has an excellent purpose which is to gain a group of sinners, whom, after saving them, He continues to separate, sanctify, and transform until they are one spirit with Him and become a people one with Him. These ones become inseparable from God. Not only are they joined to God, they are even mingled with God. They are simply a group of people that belong to God. In their daily walk and through their expression, when men see them they see God. They are the expression of God and are God manifested in the flesh.</p>
<p>The reason that God does all this is to gain a group of people who can win others to God. Not only can they win others to God, they can offer these same ones to God as offerings, that is, as food for God that He may be satisfied.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLD TESTAMENT PRIEST TURNING TO BECOME<br />
THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIEST</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament, the duty and responsibility of a priest was to take the bulls and the goats to the altar and offer them up day and night as burnt offerings to God. These became food for God. They were living sacrifices to God, satisfying God&rsquo;s heart. All these were only types.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, all the types are fulfilled. By now, what the priests of God offer as sacrifices are the sinners. We can see this turn in Matthew chapter three. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;Now in those days John the Baptist came, preaching in the wilderness of Judea.&rdquo; When John the Baptist came to fulfill his ministry he did not do it in the holy temple nor in the holy city. Rather, he went to a deserted wilderness. There was no religious flavor nor any cultural background there. Moreover, he &ldquo;had his garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey&rdquo; (v. 4). Leviticus 11:4 tells us that the camel is an unclean animal that cannot be eaten or touched. But here was John who put on camel&rsquo;s hair. Not only he himself was wild, but his food was wild also. All this shows that he fulfilled his ministry in a wild way. He did not abide by any of the old regulations.</p>
<p>What he did was even more wild. He preached, saying, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). If anyone was willing to repent, he would baptize such a one into the water. The baptism at that time was unlike today&rsquo;s practice with a proper baptistry and changing rooms. John called for repentance, and group after group went out to him confessing their sins and were baptized by him in the River Jordan (vv. 5-6). John did not fulfill his ministry according to the Old Testament way of worship at all. What he did was absolutely contrary to religion and culture. This shows that he completely rejected God&rsquo;s arrangement in the Old Testament in order that he might bring in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>But we must not forget John&rsquo;s family background. He did not come from a &ldquo;wild&rdquo; family. His father, Zachariah, was not only a priest (Luke 1:5), but one who took the lead in the priesthood. Hence, John was born into a priestly family. Moreover, his birth was of God (Luke 1:13). He was given to his parents by God. In addition, he was the firstborn who should have inherited his father&rsquo;s career to serve in the temple. However, he did not put on the priestly garments. Rather, he put on camel&rsquo;s hair. He did not eat any priestly food. Rather, he ate locusts and wild honey. Neither did he remain in the holy place burning the incense and dressing the lamps. Instead, he went to the wilderness, baptizing people into water. These were wild moves and methods. It shows that the old way of worshipping God was over; a new way was introduced. In reality John was the one who was serving as a true priest.</p><h2 class="head2">No Longer Offering Bulls and Goats,<br />
but Offering Sinners in Christ Instead</h2>
<p>John was born a priest. But this was only a type and a shadow. It was not the reality. In him, the Old Testament priesthood had a turn. It turned from the type to the reality, from the shadow to the body, and from the offering of physical bulls and goats to the offering of sinners as sacrifices. This is the sacrifice that God has been seeking for before the foundation of the world in eternity past. These sacrifices are the individual sinners. Ephesians 1:4 says, &ldquo;According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world.&rdquo; We the saved ones were chosen by God before the foundation of the world. In eternity past God chose us. It does not matter in which country or corner of the world we are; He has chosen us. We did not know when we would be born or where we would be born. God predestinated us before the foundation of the world that we would be chosen, in time be saved, and become offerings to God in Christ.</p>
<p>Although we were chosen before the foundation of the world, the time of our salvation was not yet fulfilled (Gal. 4:4). After the God-created man fell, God came in to knock at the door of Adam&rsquo;s heart in Genesis 3. He called and said, &ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; (v. 9) and preached the gospel to him by saying that the seed of the woman would bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head (v. 15). This word was the gospel and also a promise. Two thousand years later, at the time of Abraham, God came in to promise Abraham again, saying, &ldquo;In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed&rdquo; (Gen. 12:3). The seed of Abraham is Jesus Christ. After that, two thousand more years passed. Four thousand years after man was created, Jesus Christ was born of a woman and became the seed of the woman. Mary, the one who begot Jesus, was a descendant of Abraham. Consequently, Jesus, the One begotten of her, was also a seed of Abraham.</p>
<p>The first page of the New Testament records, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham&rdquo; (Matt. 1:1). Following this it says, &ldquo;Abraham begot Isaac; and Isaac begot Jacob...,&rdquo; until the end of the genealogy where &ldquo;Matthan begot Jacob; and Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ&rdquo; (vv. 15b-16). In the genealogy of Matthew we see the fulfillment of the promise made to Adam and Eve. Moreover, God&rsquo;s promise to Abraham was fulfilled as well. The Lord Jesus bruised the serpent&rsquo;s head, and He is the One in whom all the families of the earth are blessed.</p>
<p>When Christ came, He fulfilled the promises in the Old Testament. But before Christ came, God had set up the priesthood in the Old Testament already. What was there was only a shadow. God required that the Old Testament priests offer up bulls and goats. These bulls and goats were types of Christ. In the New Testament, the priests no longer offer bulls and goats. Instead, they offer the sinners chosen by God and saved in Christ.</p>
<p>Now we understand why John, born a priest, would not offer bulls and goats when he came out to fulfill his ministry. Instead, he would now offer sinners. He preached in the wilderness saying, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2). If men would repent and confess their sins he would baptize them, offering them up one by one to God. John was the first priest of the New Testament and the last priest of the Old Testament. From God&rsquo;s point of view, after John the Baptist, there were no more priests in the Old Testament. The system of service in the Old Testament ceased completely. In other words, the age had changed. The old way was changed to the new, and the Old Testament priest turned to become the New Testament priest.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH HAVING DEGRADED<br />
AND HAVING DEPARTED FROM GOD&rsquo;S ORDAINED WAY</h2>
<p>We have seen that the new way is God&rsquo;s ordained way. It matches what God wants to accomplish in Himself. However, although it is now the New Testament age and the church age, there is still the old way. The reason for this is the degradation of the church. Not long after the church was established by the apostles and even before these apostles passed away, there were believers who had left the way brought in by the apostles. The church became degraded, and its nature changed. As a result, the service, worship, and meeting of the church all changed. Everything became according to man&rsquo;s natural inclination resulting in fallen Christianity.</p>
<p>The degradation of Christianity did not come about suddenly, but through a gradual decline. Beginning from the second century, through the third century and extending to the sixth century, the degradation worsened. By A.D. 570 the archbishop of Rome was recognized by all the churches as the pope, and the Roman Catholic church was officially established. After that the Catholic church sealed up the Bible and forbade the ordinary believers to read it. Only the pope and the clergy were allowed to read it. The Bible was locked up, and this period is known in western history as the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>By the sixteenth century, Martin Luther rose up to begin the Reformation, and the sealed Bible was unlocked. This was a great accomplishment of Luther. Based on the Bible, he also recovered the truth of justification by faith. However, the ways of serving in the church and preaching the gospel remained unchanged.</p>
<p>From Catholicism, Protestantism developed. Early Protestantism was comprised of all the state religions. At that time the northern European countries all established their own national churches. In England, it was the Church of England. In Denmark, it was the national church of Denmark. Later, the private, independent churches, such as the Baptists and Methodists, developed from the state churches. All these are private churches. They have nothing to do with individual countries. At that time there was a gradual recovery of the church, but the recovery was not that thorough. There were still many things which Protestantism had inherited from Catholicism.</p>
<p>By the eighteenth century, Brother Zinzendorf was raised up by the Lord to lead others to a recovery of the church life. In the nineteenth century, there was a further recovery when the Brethren were raised up. After another century, around 1920, the Lord raised up Brother Watchman Nee in the Far East in Fukien, China. At that time I was in northern China. Although we were far apart, the Lord gained both of us. We loved the Lord and realized the real need to be delivered from the poison left by degraded Christianity. Sixty years ago we thought that we were quite thoroughly delivered from these things. Then the Lord enlightened us more and showed us that the degraded elements of Christianity had not been fully purged from us. It seemed as if we had inherited these fallen elements. Although we tried hard to be sterilized, the germs never left us.</p>
<p>We can take the way we meet as an example. Whenever we mention the meetings, there is the hope within us that as many believers as possible should be gathered together. A meeting of five hundred is better than one of one hundred, and eight hundred is better than five hundred. Of course, a thousand is even better than eight hundred. I believe that you are all very happy this morning because both the upper floor as well as the ground floor is filled with people. There are even those who are watching on closed-circuit television. All of you are listening to my speaking. You cannot say that this kind of meeting has no place. The New Testament records that when Paul went to Troas he stayed there for seven days. Because he was about to leave on the following day, he talked with the believers until after midnight. One young man by the name of Eutychus fell down from the windowsill of the third floor. When he was taken up, he was already dead. Paul went down and fell upon him. He told everyone that the young man&rsquo;s life was still in him. Then Paul went up again and conversed with the congregation for a considerable time until daybreak and went away (Acts 20:6-11). Hence, there is occasion for this kind of meeting also.</p>
<p>However, the Bible reveals to us that the regular meeting of the believers should be from house to house (Acts 2:46). After the day of Pentecost when three thousand people were saved, Peter and John only went occasionally to the temple to speak to the multitude there. Most of the time they gathered from house to house. During those gatherings it was not just one speaking while all others listened. Rather, it was everyone speaking and everyone listening. There was fellowship, prayer, the breaking of bread, teaching, and the preaching of the gospel. All these were done in the meetings in the homes of the believers. This is also the original way ordained by God for the church to meet together.</p>
<p>Because of the degradation of the church, this kind of meeting has been lost. What one sees exclusively in Christianity today are big gatherings with one speaking and all the rest listening. They have all left God&rsquo;s ordained way and fallen into human tradition. This traditional way suits man&rsquo;s natural disposition and matches the spirit of the age. As early as 1948, Brother Watchman Nee said that this kind of gathering is like the Israelites following after the customs of the nations (2 Kings 17:8). It is not scriptural. It is not easy to see through this from the surface. There is hymn singing, sermon teaching, and gospel preaching, and men are being saved. It seems as if there is nothing wrong. However, what is hidden beneath is something contrary to the universal priesthood ordained by God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Everyone Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>The priesthood that God ordained for everyone is one in which all the saved ones are priests. Moreover, the foremost offering in the New Testament is the offering of the saved sinners to God. This is the first function of the priests of the New Testament.</p>
<p>For this reason, after the coming of the New Testament age, God revealed to the last priest of the Old Testament, John the Baptist, that he was not to offer up bulls and goats anymore. Instead, he should offer up sinners in Christ. After this, the Lord Jesus came. He was also a real priest. He continued to bring sinners to salvation. The Lord Jesus also sent out disciples to preach the gospel. First, He sent out the twelve (Luke 6:12-16). Then He sent out seventy (Luke 10:1-24). After His resurrection the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18b, 19). The Lord sent us to all the nations to preach the gospel to every man, baptizing them into Himself, and offering them up as sacrifices to God. In the Epistles Paul also said that he &ldquo;should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 15:16). Paul was a priest of the gospel of God. He offered up the saved Gentiles as offerings to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">No More Service by the Clergy Alone<br />
but Every Believer Preaching the Gospel Instead</h2>
<p>We still may have natural concepts. We may think that since Brother Paul was the number one apostle, he was surely capable of preaching the gospel. But since we are neither an apostle nor a prophet, we cannot preach the gospel. To preach the gospel we have to invite a gospel giant to come to us and have him speak to everyone. This is very unscriptural and does not match the nature of God&rsquo;s ordained way in the New Testament. God ordains in the New Testament that every one of the believers should preach the gospel.</p>
<p>However, the church has become fallen. As a result, the organic function of many believers is killed. All have become incapable of preaching the gospel. Only a few have become capable in preaching the gospel and serving as a priest. The result is a clerical system. Most believers are laymen who come only for the worship services, sitting in the pews without functioning at all. This kills the arrangement and ordination of God. For the past two thousand years many Christians have become incapable of serving God. Some may not understand this. They may think that they are still serving God. Every week they still go to the meeting hall to sweep the floor, vacuum the carpets, clean the windows, arrange the chairs, and serve as ushers. All these are but the work of the Levites. They are not the services of the New Testament gospel priests.</p>
<p>From 1984 we have seen the need to change the system. However, during the last four years we have not rid ourselves completely of the poison of Christianity. It is not easy to be delivered from any kind of old tradition or system. For example, as far back as a hundred years ago the founding father of the modern Chinese Republic, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, proposed that the Chinese government turn from imperialistic rule to democracy. Today Taiwan only has a little dawning of such a system. To have a democracy is not easy. Take as another example our dress. Sixty years ago few Chinese dared to wear Western suits. They even dared not to speak English after they had learned it. But today sixty years later in Taiwan most mothers are so keen to have their children learn English. Everywhere we find people wearing Western suits. The reason for this is that the age has changed, and the tide has turned. In commerce and trade Taiwan has improved and advanced tremendously. If we do not turn, we will be left behind.</p>
<p>We have to see that the same thing is true in the service of the church. We cannot change the truth of the Bible. But how to preach and teach the truth requires much studying and improvement. We can see from the Bible that the gospel meetings with one speaking and all the rest listening is not scriptural and is not according to God&rsquo;s ordination. The Lord sent the seventy disciples to peoples&rsquo; houses and told them that &ldquo;into whatever house you enter, first say, Peace to this house. And if a son of peace is there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall return upon you&rdquo; (Luke 10:5-6). The Lord never charged the disciples to call a big meeting. Rather, He sent them out.</p>
<p>Hence, every brother and sister has to go from door to door visiting people. Today we are in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We are all priests and should all offer sacrifices. The first sacrifice we should offer to God is the sinner. If we do not offer up sinners we are not functioning priests. In the future we will have to give an account before the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s way is not for a few qualified and gifted ones to preach the gospel. He wants every saved person to go and preach the gospel. As long as you can talk, you can preach the gospel. First Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; The Bible says that we can all speak. For this reason we all have to go and speak the gospel to others, thus fulfilling our duty as priests of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">That the Beloved Saved Ones<br />
Would Offer Themselves Up in Christ</h2>
<p>After we have led sinners to be saved and have offered them up as offerings, Paul tells us in Romans 12:1, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service.&rdquo; Paul begged the sinners to present their bodies and offer themselves willingly as sacrifices to God. This is another step that we have to lead others to take.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Everyone Attending Home and Group Meetings</h2>
<p>In Colossians 1:28 Paul said, &ldquo;Warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.&rdquo; To be presented full-grown is similar to being picked as ripe fruit in an orchard during harvest time. This whole process of growth is included in the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings. In the end, through these different meetings we will be perfected step by step until we can finally be presented to God full-grown.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Everyone Prophesying for the Lord</h2>
<p>Today we have to see that we are all New Testament priests. Everyone needs to preach the gospel. Everyone has to attend the home meetings and group meetings. Everyone must prophesy. When we prophesy, we have to exercise our spirit. There must be not only the revelation and the light; there must be the inspiration also. In this way Christ will be spoken into others. Only when all these things are put into practice can the universal priesthood be realized.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
BEING UNIVERSAL</h2>
<p>We have seen that the Lord&rsquo;s ordained way always matches the economy that He is after. We have also seen that God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is to have every saved person be a priest. The New Testament priesthood is universal. There should not be only a group of people who are priests while the others are not. Instead, everyone should be a priest. It does not matter how young you are. As long as you are a saved person, having the Lord&rsquo;s life, you are a member of the Body of Christ and therefore a priest. To the Lord, you are His member. To God, you are His priest. Also, a priest is one who is joined to God as one. God has entered into us and has brought us into Him. We mutually abide in each other. We and God and God and we have become one. By this, we become a people who belong to God and who serve God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS<br />
OFFERING UP SINNERS IN CHRIST</h2>
<p>A priest is one who serves God, and to serve God is to offer up sacrifices. The word <em>priest</em> carries the sense of one who is managing. A priest is one who manages the offerings. He is one with God and receives a commission from God. He is not only sent from God but is one who serves with God. His specific work is the managing of the offerings of God.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the offerings were the bulls and goats. We know that the Old Testament priests and offerings were all types; they were not the reality. The reality had not yet come. Not until four thousand years after the creation of Adam did Christ come in the flesh. Only then was the time fulfilled. At that time, the reality came. Hence, the angel announced to Mary that she would conceive a child, who was Christ. When Christ came, all the types in the Old Testament were fulfilled and realized. There is no more need for the types. Now Christ is everything.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:7 says, &ldquo;Behold, I come...to do Your will, O God.&rdquo; From the context we see that God&rsquo;s will here is that Christ fulfill and replace all the Old Testament sacrifices. From now on, there are no more sacrifices. There is only one true sacrifice left, which is Christ Himself.</p>
<p>Hence, the New Testament priests no longer offer bulls and goats for sacrifices. Rather, they offer the fallen sinners treasured and chosen by God before the foundation of the earth as sacrifices (Rom. 15:16). However, these sinners cannot in themselves become the sacrifices, for they have all sinned. We know that the sacrifices are for the dealing with, the removal of, and the redemption from sin. Thank God for His salvation. After He saved us, He put us into Christ so that we have a change in position. We are no longer in Adam; we are now in Christ. Once we are in Christ, God can justify and accept us. While we were yet sinners, we were not the sacrifices. But when we are in Christ, we are the sacrifices acceptable to God.</p>
<p>For this reason, many times in Paul&rsquo;s Epistles he mentions us being in Christ. For example, Colossians 1:28 says, &ldquo;Warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ.&rdquo; When we are in ourselves, we are not qualified to be offered up. But whenever we are in Christ, we can be offered up to God. We can even be presented full-grown.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GREATEST JOY FOR CHRISTIANS BEING<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND TO SAVE SINNERS</h2>
<p>Christ is the seed of woman bruising the serpent&rsquo;s head. He is also the seed of Abraham accomplishing God&rsquo;s redemption and bestowing the blessing of God&rsquo;s redemption, the all-inclusive Spirit of the Triune God, to everyone who believes and is saved (Gal. 3:14). Furthermore, this Spirit, which is the all-inclusive Spirit, is the unique blessing in God&rsquo;s redemption. It is typified by the land of Canaan. In this Spirit we enjoy Christ as everything and receive this blessing.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that Christ has come and has accomplished everything. God desires not only that we the saved ones enjoy Him. He is also sending us out to save the sinners that they would believe into Christ and would be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In this way, they will also be able to enjoy this blessing. We the saved ones are no longer in Adam nor in ourselves. Rather, we are in the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. This is our status.</p>
<p>We also have to see that we are destined by the Lord of all to be priests. We should preach the gospel to sinners, saving them into Christ and baptizing them into the Triune God. Whenever we baptize a person, we are offering up a treasure on the altar. One sinner is one treasure offered up. Ten sinners are ten treasures offered up. All the Christians know that the greatest joy is to preach the gospel and to save sinners. For a church to be living, enlivened, and revived, there is no other way except for it to be a gospel-preaching church.</p>
<p>If a church has been here for eight years and has not saved one person, but instead everyone sees the same old faces over and over again, surely there will be no joy. But if a church has a few new faces and especially if the new ones would stand up and say a few words, though the speaking may not be that good, everyone will feel very happy. Therefore, if we do not save sinners, it is difficult for us to have joy. Likewise, if a church does not preach the gospel to save sinners, it is difficult for her to have joy.</p>
<p>When we save the sinners and baptize them, humanly speaking, we are putting them into the water. But according to God&rsquo;s view, we are priests &ldquo;priesting&rdquo; these offerings to God. All who have done this know what joy it is when a person comes out of the water. Our joy is ecstatic. We feel as if we are being raptured. In reality, this is because God is rejoicing there. In Luke chapter fifteen, the Lord speaks to us in a parable: &ldquo;What man of you, having a hundred sheep and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?&rdquo; (v. 4). When the sheep is found, the angels in heaven rejoice over it (v. 7). This is what is described in <em>Hymns,</em> #1068: &ldquo;While angels in His presence sang until the courts of heaven rang&rdquo; (stanza 1). If a sinner is not a treasure, why do the angels rejoice when he is saved? The writer of this hymn knew the heart of God and wrote accurately.</p>
<p>We must see that this is a joyful and exuberant matter and a most glorious charge. We all have to go forth to bring the sinners to salvation that they would become offerings in Christ to be offered up to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE BEING RECOVERED<br />
TO PREACH THE GOSPEL<br />
AND TO SERVE AS PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>We have to realize that today&rsquo;s Christianity is degraded. It has fallen away from God&rsquo;s ordained way. For example, the gospel campaign meetings where one speaks and all listen have killed the gospel-preaching function in all the saints. Although the saints are still willing to participate in the gospel work, they cannot preach nor do they have the opportunity to preach. Instead, they can only participate in some Levitical services, such as moving the chairs, cleaning the windows, vacuuming the carpets, and inviting people to come to love feasts. Eventually, no one can preach the gospel. Everything depends on one speaker. The rest just listen. This is indeed wrong.</p>
<p>The more the one speaker speaks, the less the saints are able to speak. After ten years, everyone becomes a dumb person. If a person covers his eyes for five years, he will become a blind man. After a child is born, if he does not speak for ten years, his parents will consider him a dumb child. If we have been preaching in a place for ten years and have saved one or two hundred people but have not been able to perfect anyone to become priests of the gospel, we have killed the saints&rsquo; organic function.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s ordained way today matches the universal priesthood of the New Testament. If the former does not match the latter, the universal priesthood will never be realized; we will not have everyone preaching the gospel, and God&rsquo;s New Testament economy will not be fulfilled. Christianity does worship the true God, but it has killed the worshipper. Although it is doing a right thing, it is doing it with a wrong method. This is the case with one man preaching the gospel while all listen. Many of the activities in Christianity can be summarized with the phrase, &ldquo;right in goal, but wrong in means.&rdquo; In the end, a serious mistake is committed; all the organic functions of the saints are killed. Hence, we must desperately take this new way and recover everyone to preach the gospel and be priests of the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">WORSHIP IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Old Testament Worship<br />
Being a Matter of a Physical Place</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, one day He intended to go from Jerusalem to Galilee. John 4:4 says that &ldquo;He had to pass through Samaria.&rdquo; I have studied the map and found out that from any point of view, there was no need for the Lord to pass through Samaria. There were many ways to get from Jerusalem to Galilee. But the Lord said that He &ldquo;had to.&rdquo; The reason for this is that He had the burden to visit that detested, immoral, yet God-chosen woman living in Samaria. She had had five husbands already. In this passage we see the wisdom of the Lord. He came to visit her in a different way than He visited Zaccheus in Jericho. There He stayed at the house of Zaccheus and saved him. But here the Lord Jesus did not do this. He came rather after midday and waited for the woman by the well where she drew water. This was the most suitable place. He could talk to the woman in the bright daylight. From this we see the full wisdom of our Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>About the sixth hour, the Samaritan woman came to draw water. The Lord said to her, &ldquo;Give Me a drink&rdquo; (John 4:7). The Samaritan woman answered, &ldquo;How is it that you, a Jew, ask me for a drink...?&rdquo; (v. 9). After the Lord answered her, she asked some more questions. In the course of the conversation, the woman knew that the Lord Jesus was different, that He had the living water with Him. She began to ask of the Lord, &ldquo;Sir, give me this water so I will not thirst&rdquo; (v. 15). If we were to have answered that woman, we would have said, &ldquo;Confess your sins and then you can drink the living water.&rdquo; But the Lord Jesus was not as foolish as we are. He answered in a wise way, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (v. 16).</p>
<p>The Lord wanted her to get her husband before He would give to her the living water. The woman was most afraid of being asked concerning this matter. Immediately she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a husband&rdquo; (v. 17). This is to lie by telling the truth. The Lord Jesus did not deny her words. He only said, &ldquo;You have well said, I don&rsquo;t have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). The woman did not confess her sins. But the Lord Jesus pointed out in detail all her sins. The woman was very surprised. She was also very clever. Immediately she turned the subject from the drinking of living water to religious worship. She said, &ldquo;Sir, I see that you are a prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&rdquo; (vv. 19-20). She was very clever. She turned from the five husbands to the matter of worship of God, from being a sinner to being a religionist. This shows that many zealous worshippers of God are also sinners and evildoers behind the scenes. The Lord Jesus then opened her heart and said to her, &ldquo;Woman, believe Me, an hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father&rdquo; (v. 21). The Lord wanted to show her that the age had changed. The Old Testament was over, and the New Testament had come.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Testament Worship<br />
Being a Matter of the Human Spirit</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus continued speaking to her, &ldquo;But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him&rdquo; (v. 23). The Old Testament worship depended upon a physical place. But the New Testament worship does not depend upon anything physical. Neither does it depend upon any place. Rather, it depends upon the human spirit.</p>
<p>If we worship God only according to a place, there is still the possibility of committing sins. But if we worship God according to our spirit, we cannot sin. This is because the major part of the spirit is the conscience, and the conscience will not allow us to sin. For example, a thief may have stolen from the bank last night. Yet today, on Sunday, he may still go to attend church services in the morning. This is because his concept is that of a physical place. He is worshipping God in a chapel. But if he turns to his spirit to worship God, he cannot rob the bank anymore, for his conscience will not allow him to do this. This is also why we have to change from the old way to the new. It is not merely a matter of method but a story of inward nature.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, people worshipped God in one place. As long as the place was right, there could be worship. But in the New Testament it is not a question of place but a question of the human spirit. The spirit is the true part and the central part of a person. This organ has to be right. Furthermore, our spirit lies within our heart. If our spirit is right, our heart will be right. Today, in the new way, our preaching of the gospel, our meeting in the homes and in the small groups, and even our prophesying in the district meetings are not changes in outward methods. Rather, the need for outward changes comes because of the change in inward nature. If our meetings and gospel preaching are all by one man speaking while all listen, we are not according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and not all the saints will be able to be priests of the gospel. If we do not change the old way and take the new way, our meetings and service will all be outward. They will not be in the spirit. Everything will be a matter of method. Nothing will be in reality. Hence, everything of the new way is not a matter of place, form, method, or procedure, but a matter of reality in the spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Those in the Old Testament<br />
Worshipping God in the Temple,<br />
but Those in the New Testament<br />
Worshipping God in Christ the God-man</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament, man worshipped the God in the temple. In the Old Testament age, when a man wanted to worship God, he had to go to the temple. But the New Testament worship is not in the temple. Rather, it is in Christ because God is in Christ.</p>
<p>Today, although our God is the same as the one that the Jews worshipped, there is a difference in age, and there is also a difference in form. The God that the Jews worshipped then was only God; He was not man. He had only divinity; there was no humanity. But in the New Testament, the God that we Christians worship is both God and man. He is a God-man. When we worship God today, we are worshipping such a One. All who are not worshipping this God-man are not worshipping God. Today, God is an incarnated God, a God that is mingled with man. When we worship Him, we are enjoying not only God, we are enjoying Man as well. This is marvelous.</p>
<p>During the three and a half years when the Lord Jesus was fulfilling His ministry on earth, sometimes He was in Galilee, far away from Jerusalem. But sometimes He went to Jerusalem and was even found near the temple there. In the temple, there were rows and rows of priests serving God properly and according to the regulations of the Old Testament. But Jesus was not there. Perhaps He was in a little cottage beside the temple. There we see a group of Galileans, some sitting and some standing. There are even some tax collectors and harlots. All these are lowly Galileans. At this time, was God being worshipped in the temple, or was Jesus being worshipped? Do we go up to the temple, or do we go to a little cottage to worship God?</p>
<p>We can see clearly that at that time, God was in that little house. This is because Jesus was there, and God was inside Jesus Christ. The most difficult point we encounter when we preach the gospel to the Jews is that they still think that God is in the temple. They do not believe that God is in Jesus Christ. We have to tell the Jews that God left the temple two thousand years ago. Today you cannot find God outside of Christ. You must go to Christ. When you are in Christ, you will find God.</p>
<p>In the same principle, today when we worship God, we should not be attracted by beautiful cathedrals. We are seeking Christ, and we are worshipping Christ. We go to the place where Christ is. This is the New Testament worship. Originally, we were meeting in big meeting halls with pianos and dignified sermons. Later, we were led to have home meetings and small group meetings. Four or five families now meet together in homes. Some homes look alright. But other homes are quite uncomely; the chairs are broken, the benches are crooked, and there is no separation between the kitchen and the dining room. As a result, some brothers and sisters find such meetings impossible to take. They are not willing to come to this kind of meeting.</p>
<p>However, we have to see that to worship God in the New Testament, we have to find where Christ is. Do not despise a place that appears ragged, for Jesus may be dwelling there. Today, His name is not yet the glorified Christ. His name today is called Jesus of Nazareth. Hence, we all have to see why we must change this old way. The old way suits our natural human concept. But in the Bible, God&rsquo;s ordained way matches His economy. For this reason, we must return to the New Testament and worship and serve according to the New Testament. Only then will we satisfy God&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO WORSHIP IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having No Form of Worship<br />
With No Outward Set Program or Procedure</h2>
<p>Worship in the New Testament has no form. If there is a form, it will easily become a worship service. However, until today, after we lead people to salvation, they still have the natural concept of attending worship services. On Sunday, they will look for chapels nearby in order that they might attend services. The beginning of a program is usually hymn singing. Then the preacher offers his prayer. After that, the pastor delivers his sermon and expounds the Bible. When the service is near its end, there is another hymn with prayer and benediction following. We have to see that it is not wrong to worship God. But it is absolutely wrong if we take the above way. A set program and procedure will fully kill the spirit within the saints. We must never bring this way of worship service into the home meeting, small group meeting, or Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. Its result is terrible. We have to change our concept completely so that we can have the New Testament worship.</p><h2 class="head2">Serving Only by the Spirit of God</h2>
<p>The way to worship in the New Testament is for all of us to use our spirit. Before we attend a meeting, we are a worshipper of God already. Every morning we have a revival, and every day, in our daily living, we are constantly renewed and overcoming and are in constant touch and fellowship with the Lord. In addition, our lives are filled with hymns. <em>Hymns,</em> #501 and #1068 or a more simple one such as #1024 are hymns that I like to sing. They are all very good songs. We can learn to sing them often in our daily lives.</p>
<p>If we have made an appointment with the brothers and sisters to have a home meeting at 7:30 tonight, then by 6:30 we should be ready. We should begin singing. We do not begin the meeting at the meeting place. Rather, we begin it before we leave our house. Perhaps while we walk we sing, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart!&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #309). We do not have to wait until we knock on the door before we sing. We can sing one stanza for each floor that we ascend. When we reach the saint&rsquo;s home and while we are ringing the bell, we can still sing, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart!&rdquo; Those inside the door who hear the singing may respond by singing also, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart! Floods of joy o&rsquo;er my soul like the sea billows roll, since Jesus came into my heart!&rdquo; The children in the house may then echo the singing. How living that would be!</p>
<p>We have to know that when we meet together we must exercise our spirits. God is Spirit, and no one can touch Him without exercising his spirit. Paul said in Philippians 3:3 that the true worshippers are those who are in Christ, who serve by the Spirit of God. The content of our meetings should be filled with much singing, praying, and speaking. We should also have our meetings by the Spirit. To be &ldquo;by the Spirit&rdquo; means that I am a person who starts off the morning in a revived way. I am living, and I am daily renewed and daily overcoming. I maintain my spirit in a high position, and I am in fellowship with the Lord. Even before the meeting starts, to me the meeting has started in my home. Because I am so living, I do not have to say much when I come to the home meeting. All I have to do is to sing a few hymns and the spirits of others are enlivened. This is to serve God in the New Testament by the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Small Group Meeting Being<br />
Mainly for the Perfecting of the Saints</h2>
<p>In the small group meeting, it may be that I would not come until the set time arrives. After I come, I am an observer waiting for others while they in turn wait for me. I may call a hymn after ten minutes, and another brother may say, &ldquo;The church has decided that we read the <em>Truth Lessons.</em> Let us all read in turn.&rdquo; After the reading with some fellowship and prayer, the meeting is dismissed. This is what Christianity considers as a worship service. There are the programs, the procedures, and the proper order. But there is no Spirit, and there is no supply. The meeting is dead, and the church suffers. We cannot take this way.</p>
<p>When we attend a meeting in the new way, first, we must be a man filled with the Spirit and with singing. On our way to the small group meeting, we should sing, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart!&rdquo; while we walk. Those brothers and sisters who hear us, respond by singing, &ldquo;What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought...&rdquo; Perhaps another one would sing, &ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace! The Christ who&rsquo;s all within me lives&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #499). This kind of singing back and forth, each with his own song, will enliven our spirits. There is no need to say too much. We will touch one another&rsquo;s spirit.</p>
<p>In the meeting, there should be singing and praying. After the singing, someone should pray. There need not be any definite person to pray. We can all say, &ldquo;Lord, we do praise and thank You. This is such joy, that You are with us.&rdquo; We do not necessarily have to close our eyes either, or to tell everyone to bow their heads. When the Lord Jesus prayed, He lifted up His eyes to heaven (John 17:1). None of the above forms are found in the Bible. They are merely old ordinances of the worship service. What we need to do is to follow the Spirit.</p>
<p>After this, another might open his mouth and say, &ldquo;Brothers and sisters, how wonderful! This morning I read Romans 12:1. There Paul beseeches us by the mercies of God to present our bodies. Previously when I read these verses, they were not as sweet as they were this morning. That is why I was never able to present myself. But this morning I consecrated myself thoroughly to the Lord.&rdquo; When the brothers and sisters hear this, immediately they will praise the Lord for this. The speaking does not stop with this one. Two or three follow the first one, and the place is filled with praises and thanksgivings!</p>
<p>Then, a newly saved brother may ask, &ldquo;How can we the saved persons present our bodies?&rdquo; When a question is raised, we can let every brother and sister take turns speaking. We do not have to leave the answering to one man. Perhaps a young sister would begin, &ldquo;Brother, let me tell you. Previously, we were all busy for ourselves. Our time and our bodies were fully occupied. Now that we are saved and have come to love the Lord, Paul is exhorting us to present our bodies. According to my experience, to present our bodies is to present our time because our bodies are confined to our time.&rdquo; She only speaks a few sentences. The whole thing takes less than a minute. Everybody hears it and is touched by it.</p>
<p>Perhaps among those in the meeting, I have been in the Lord longer and have had more experience. Yet, I will not assume my seniority and speak for a long time. What I speak is just what the first sister spoke. I may say, &ldquo;She was absolutely right. To present our bodies is to present our time. If we do not present our time, our bodies cannot come.&rdquo; That is all I say. I do not tell any story nor do I give a long sermon. Everyone speaks a few simple sentences. The whole speaking takes only a few minutes.</p>
<p>Perhaps another sister would ask again, &ldquo;How then do I present my body? Does that mean that I don&rsquo;t work and don&rsquo;t teach but instead stay home and offer my body to the Lord?&rdquo; This is a very practical question. However, I should still not take the lead to speak. I let the newly saved ones speak more. Perhaps after a while, one who has been saved for only half a year says, &ldquo;When I read Romans 12, not only do I see the presenting of the body, I see the transformation and renewing of the mind as well. Therefore, first there is the presenting of the body, and then there is the renewing and transforming of the mind.&rdquo; Another one may not understand this too well. He may ask, &ldquo;How then can the mind be renewed?&rdquo; A third one may say, &ldquo;According to my experience, to be transformed in the mind, we have to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word. When we receive the Lord&rsquo;s word into us, the word itself will change our concepts. This is the transformation of the mind.&rdquo; This is a very good answer.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters may then ask, &ldquo;After the body is presented and the mind is transformed, what happens next?&rdquo; I remember that I have read this passage before. And so I answer saying, &ldquo;In Romans 12, first you have the presenting of the body, and then you have the transformation of the mind. Lastly, in verse 11, there is the burning in spirit to serve the Lord.&rdquo; When we speak in this way, everybody will understand and will be enlightened.</p>
<p>This kind of small group meeting in which everyone speaks, everyone asks, everyone answers, everyone learns, and everyone teaches is surely living, fresh, rich, and simple. As a result, the number will surely increase. The reason for this is that there is no formality in worship, and there is no set program or procedure. Everyone acts according to the Spirit, moves according to the Spirit, and serves according to the Spirit of God. All the brothers and sisters who attend this kind of meeting will be perfected. Every week throughout the fifty-two weeks of the year, we should set aside an evening for this kind of meeting. After a new one meets in this way for a year, he will be perfected. He will grow in life, and he will be able to serve by the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Prophesying Being Mainly<br />
for the Building Up of the Church</h2>
<p>Not only do we bring the new ones to the small group meeting, but also, on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we bring them to the church meeting. After the breaking of the bread, they may see that so many brothers and sisters are prophesying, that is, speaking for the Lord and speaking forth the Lord. Some may prophesy for three minutes, some for two. After watching this for a few weeks, the new ones will feel attracted to it and may desire to prophesy also. We will then help them along, first to prophesy in the small group meeting and then to prophesy in the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting. In the end, everyone in the whole church will be able to prophesy. Both young and old will be able to speak for the Lord, and the riches of the Lord will be manifested. All will be supplied, edified, and nourished, and the church as the Body of Christ will be built up through the prophesying by the saints. This is what the Lord is after today.</p>
<p>Therefore, our way of meeting must be changed. Our former way of meeting afforded no benefit to the Lord&rsquo;s economy and did not match the nature of God&rsquo;s economy. Now we have found out God&rsquo;s ordained way according to the Bible. Every point of His ordained way matches the nature of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, and meets the need of God&rsquo;s economy. In the end, God&rsquo;s economy will be realized among us. I hope that we will practice this together. May the Lord bless all of you.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:8-10, 58</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW WAY REQUIRING<br />
THE EXPERIENCE OF DEATH AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>The verses that we read tonight are all from the book of 1 Corinthians. In particular, they are all from the fifteenth chapter. We have seen that chapters fourteen and fifteen are two very meaningful chapters. Chapter fourteen of 1 Corinthians speaks mainly about prophesying. Only prophesying builds the church. Immediately after 1 Corinthians 14, Paul dealt with the question of resurrection in chapter fifteen. This shows us that the prophesying in chapter fourteen must be done in resurrection. In our natural being, we can speak only ordinary words; there is no possibility for us to speak for the Lord. For this reason, we have to learn to remain in resurrection so that we can speak for God and speak forth God.</p>
<p>The reason that we condemn the old way is because it keeps us in the natural realm. We do not know how to apply the power of resurrection nor is there the need to do so in our environment. As a result, we continue on in the old way in our natural being. Whatever we need to do in the new way, we cannot do in our natural being. To preach the gospel according to the way ordained in the New Testament, we have to contact and visit people directly in order that they may be saved from their environment and that we may offer them up to God as sacrifices. However, this is something that the natural man cannot accomplish. Only by the resurrection power can this be achieved.</p>
<p>We know that the Holy Spirit is the reality of resurrection. When you are in the Holy Spirit, you are in resurrection. Although resurrection and the Holy Spirit are closely related, in our subjective experience resurrection is even more closely tied to death. Our natural being with its natural strength and natural views must pass through death before we can enter into resurrection. <em>Hymns,</em> #279 says, &ldquo;First the blood, and then the ointment, cleansing, then anointing comes; if we pass not thru Golgotha, ne&rsquo;er to Pentecost we&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo; If we do not pass through the death on the cross, we can never receive the Spirit at Pentecost because the Spirit at Pentecost is the reality of resurrection. In order to have the reality of resurrection, we need to pass through Golgotha.</p>
<p>Today we have seen this new way as revealed in the Bible. We also have seen that to take this way there is the need to pass through death and resurrection at every step. I would especially like to show the brothers who are serving as elders in the church that to lead the brothers and sisters on in this new way requires us to be persons who live in resurrection. We must go through death. Then we can enter into resurrection and into the reality of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE PAUL EXPERIENCING<br />
THE GRACE OF GOD<br />
TO LABOR MORE ABUNDANTLY</h2>
<p>When Paul spoke of the resurrection of Christ in 1 Corinthians 15, he did not treat it merely as a subject of defense against the heresy in the church. Rather, he applied resurrection to himself. In verse 5, he began by mentioning the Lord&rsquo;s appearing after His resurrection. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;And last of all He was seen by me also, even as to one untimely born.&rdquo; Then Paul went on to say, &ldquo;For I am the least of the apostles, who am not fit to be called an apostle&rdquo; (v. 9). &ldquo;But by the grace of God I am what I am...I labored more abundantly than all of them&rdquo; (v. 10). This shows us that the apostle had one outstanding feature&mdash;his labor. The more you labor, the more you are an apostle. Because Paul labored more than all the apostles, he was an apostle among the apostles. But then he said, &ldquo;Yet not I, but the grace of God with me&rdquo; (v. 10). It was the grace of God that constituted him the kind of person that he was.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;The Word was God.&rdquo; Then verse 14 says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; Verse 17 continues, &ldquo;For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Grace came through Jesus Christ. This shows us that grace is just Jesus Christ, the embodiment and expression of the Triune God. He has passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit. Today He can enter into our spirit to be our enjoyment. Hence, the consummation of this Triune God, the life-giving Spirit, is now grace.</p>
<p>Also 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Grace, love, and fellowship are not three separate things; rather, they are three aspects of one thing. Love is the source. When love is expressed, it becomes grace. When grace comes to us, it becomes fellowship, and this fellowship is the Holy Spirit. Hence, the Holy Spirit is the coming to us of the Triune God.</p>
<p>By this, we see that grace is the consummated Spirit of the processed Triune God coming into us to be our everything. When this grace came to Paul in resurrection, it made him an apostle among apostles. He became a person that he could not otherwise have been. Therefore he said, &ldquo;Yet not I, but the grace of God with me&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:10).</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1 Corinthians 15, Paul applied the grace of resurrection to himself. In the last verse, he exhorted the brothers, &ldquo;Wherefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord&rdquo; (v. 58). To abound in the work of the Lord means that we are filled with the work of the Lord.</p>
<p>If we do not have the work of the Lord with us today, it shows that we are not in grace or in resurrection. Rather, we are in the natural realm. The natural life comes from Adam, but the resurrection life is received at regeneration. In the new way which the Lord has recovered today, no one can meet the need by their natural life. Especially those brothers who are taking the lead in the churches should realize that such work cannot be accomplished by the natural man. Only by remaining in the grace of resurrection can we abound in the work of the Lord for the furtherance of the new way.</p><h2 class="head1">NEWNESS BEING NEWNESS IN NATURE</h2>
<p>The new way today is not a term that we have invented. It is mentioned specifically in the New Testament. Hebrews 10:20 says, &ldquo;By a new and living way, which He dedicated for us through the veil.&rdquo; Through His crucifixion the Lord has opened up this new way for us. His flesh was crucified on the cross that the veil of the old creation might be removed. Through His blood, He has brought us before God that we might become a new creation to take the new way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this new way which the Bible speaks of is not new in method but in nature. The old way, which is in opposition to the new way, is the way of the law in the Old Testament. It is a way taken according to the old creation. The new way is in the New Testament and is taken according to the new creation. It is not a change in method but a change in inward nature. For example, when we preach the gospel now, we encourage the saints to visit people by knocking on doors. This, however, is not a change from an old method to a new method. Because the light from the Lord has become stronger recently and because we have seen that gospel preaching in which one speaks and all listen is contrary to the nature of the new creation in the New Testament, we are reluctant to return to the old way. We want to have a change in nature to preach the gospel and serve God according to God&rsquo;s desire and the pattern set forth in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL PRIESTHOOD IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Old Testament Priest Turning to Become<br />
the New Testament Priest</h2>
<p>We see from the Bible that the turn from the Old Testament to the New Testament occurred with John the Baptist. His father was a chief priest at that time. Hence, John was born a priest. But as far as God is concerned, he was the last priest of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>When John grew up, he waxed strong in his spirit and lived in the wilderness (Luke 1:80). He did not live in the temple nor did he live in a priest&rsquo;s home. Rather, he lived in the wilderness. This shows that the age had changed. When he came to fulfill his ministry, he did not eat the priestly food nor did he wear the priestly garments. Matthew 3:4 says, &ldquo;Now John himself had his garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and wild honey.&rdquo; This shows that John had forsaken human culture and religion. He preached in the wilderness, saying, &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo; (v. 2). If a man repented and was willing to confess his sins, John would baptize him in the Jordan River (v. 6). All of this shows that John fulfilled his ministry in a &ldquo;wild&rdquo; way. He did not abide by the old regulations. This means that the old way of worshipping God according to the Old Testament was annulled. A new way was to be introduced.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Testament Priests<br />
Offering Up Sinners in Christ</h2>
<p>The Old Testament priests offered up bulls and goats as sacrifices to God. In the New Testament, the first sacrifice that the priests must offer is the saved sinners. Paul said in Romans 15:16 that he was &ldquo;ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable.&rdquo; This is the first and basic offering in the New Testament. Other than this, there is the offering of our praises, the offering of good works, and the offering of material goods (Heb. 13:15-16). This is like the heave offering and the drink offering in the Old Testament, which are in addition to the five basic offerings.</p>
<p>The offerings in the Old Testament are a type of Christ. In the New Testament, we save the sinners who were in Adam, put them into Christ, and offer them up to God. After this, we have to help them get into Romans 12, beseeching them to present themselves a living sacrifice to God (v. 1). That is not all. Paul said that we should be &ldquo;warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ&rdquo; (Col. 1:28).</p><h2 class="head2">Every Believer Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>The New Testament priesthood is universal; it is not just for a minority of people. This means that every saved person is a priest. Everyone needs to offer up sinners as sacrifices. Although in the past we were in one accord to arouse the whole church to preach the gospel, most of the brothers and sisters were not priests of the gospel. They were only there serving as Levites. They served only in ushering, inviting, cleaning, and chair arranging. Only the few brothers who delivered messages were the priests. Hence, the old way of preaching the gospel kills the universal priesthood of the New Testament.</p>
<p>Today when we help all the brothers and sisters to be priests, we have to help them all to preach the gospel. Everyone has to go out to save people directly. No one can replace anyone else. This is what is illustrated in John 15. The Lord is the true vine, and we are branches of that vine. Those branches that do not bear fruit are cut off (vv. 1-2). The cutting off here does not refer to eternal perdition. Rather, it refers to the loss of the rich enjoyment in Christ.</p>
<p>Hence, we have to see that today the need is not to change the method of gospel preaching. Because the gospel preaching in the old way kills the priesthood of the saints and replaces the universal priesthood with a few priests, we have to turn from such error. This is an error in the system and in nature. In order for us to recover the universal priesthood of believers in the New Testament, everyone has to go preach the gospel and be a priest. The first offering that we have to offer in Christ is the saved sinner. Only by doing so can we be the New Testament priests of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW TESTAMENT WORSHIP<br />
BEING A MATTER OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>I mentioned in the conference in Kaohsiung last week the reason why we must annul the gatherings of one man speaking and all listening and must have the small group gatherings instead. I would like to repeat this matter based on the New Testament.</p>
<p>John chapter four records the Lord&rsquo;s conversation with a dishonorable Samaritan woman (vv. 5-26). The woman was very clever. When the Lord touched the matter of her sins, she immediately turned the conversation from the five husbands to the matter of religious worship. She said, &ldquo;Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men must worship&rdquo; (v. 20). The Lord answered her, saying, &ldquo;An hour is coming when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall you worship the Father....the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality&rdquo; (vv. 21-23). The Lord was revealing to her that the worship in the Old Testament was a matter of a physical place, but now the New Testament has come. The New Testament worship is a matter of the human spirit. Only when we are in spirit and in reality can God gain the true worship. Unfortunately, Christianity has become degraded; those in it have not worshipped and served in the spirit. Hence, we have to recover the New Testament worship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORSHIPPING AND SERVING ONLY BY<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2>
<p>We have received light from the Lord to see that the New Testament worship is not a matter of religious service. It should not have any set time or place and should have no set program or procedures. Paul said in Philippians 3:3 that we serve in Christ by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Our coming together tonight is not just for a worship service nor is it merely a meeting. We are coming by the Spirit of God. We have to exercise our spirit to sing, praise, pray, and speak for the Lord. Strictly speaking, our meeting should not begin at the scheduled time. Rather, it should begin from the time that we leave our home for the meeting. It should even begin from the time of our morning revival. During the whole day we should live in this condition of praise, revival, and renewal. In the evening when we come to the meeting and even before we come to the meeting, we begin to sing and praise. When the brothers and sisters gradually arrive, some sooner and others later, they all begin to exercise their spirits. This kind of serving by the Spirit of God is not a worship service. Rather, it is the proper way to worship according to the New Testament.</p>
<p>The reason that we have to change the system today is not merely to change a method and replace the big meetings with small meetings. Rather, it is because the big meetings with one speaker do not match the nature of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This is why we have to change the system. God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is for everyone to be saved, regenerated, and enlivened in his spirit. From the day that one is saved, he should be a revived person, praising and singing all the time. When he comes to the meeting, he should be able to exercise his spirit and serve by the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>In the small group meeting, every one of us should either sing or pray. Some should also spontaneously give some testimonies. Some can raise questions for discussion so that one another&rsquo;s needs can be met. There should be fellowship and prayer for one another which include shepherding and care. In this way, it will not be just a meeting but a communal living of the Christians. It will not be a big community but a small community. Only then will we truly be delivered from the religious system to realize God&rsquo;s desire.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OLD WAY ANNULLING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>Our big gospel meetings in the past with their numbers of responses and baptisms were quite impressive. But as far as the nature of the New Testament is concerned, they have killed the function of most of the saints. In other words, they have killed the universal priesthood of the New Testament and have caused a few to become the super-clergy. In principle, this is an offense to the Lord because it has fully annulled God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We must realize today that it is absolutely not a matter of a change in method. We need a thorough repentance, and we need to drop all the ways that are not according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The old way offends God. When God sovereignly works in a circumstance, He may gather many people together just as He did on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-41). However, even at that time after three thousand were saved, they began to break bread, fellowship, teach the truth, and preach the gospel from house to house. This shows us that other than on special occasions, all the brothers and sisters should bear fruit directly in their daily lives. They should be priests of God&rsquo;s gospel directly, offering up the gospel sacrifices, which are the saved sinners. If they do not do this, they are acting contrary to God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE REQUIRING A GENUINE REVIVAL</h2>
<p>There is grace for us in the New Testament. If we want to enjoy the grace of the New Testament, we have to meet the requirements of the New Testament. We also have to see that the requirements and demands of the New Testament can never be fulfilled by our natural man. Hence, the New Testament shows us a way; we have to be in Christ. We have to die with Him and resurrect with Him. When we experience death and resurrection, it will no longer be I but Christ living in us.</p>
<p>In Galatians 2:20 Paul said, &ldquo;I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.&rdquo; He also said in 1 Corinthians 15:10, &ldquo;But by the grace of God I am what I am...yet not I, but the grace of God with me.&rdquo; Hence, the grace of God is just Christ. Christ is the grace of God.</p>
<p>Only by being in Christ and sharing in His death and resurrection can we possibly live a life of true consecration. Only this is true revival. Today the church in Taipei, including all the co-workers and elders, needs such a revival. We have studied the framework of the new way thoroughly. What we need now is to be enriched in content. In other words, the inward essence has to be changed. To change a man not only involves changing his outward attire. It involves a change in his being. Today the man in the old creation has to be changed into a man in the new creation, one that is in resurrection.</p>
<p>I hope that starting from tonight everyone would go to the Lord and have a thorough prayer. We should pray to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I am still under Your grace and mercy. I am still partaking of the eldership here. I do want to follow You in the way ordained and revealed by You, the way that matches Your economy in resurrection. You have now shown us this way. But I know that I am helpless. I give myself to You. Keep me in Your resurrection.&rdquo; If we pray this way, the Spirit of the Lord will surely be with us abundantly. This is a true revival. Moreover, daily we should renew this revival; this is like the rising of the sun. In this way, we will truly be living in the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, and there will be power from on high to supply us. We will be able to meet the demands of the New Testament and testify that we are those who have truly received abundant grace from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BEING FAITHFUL TO FULFILL<br />
THE WORDS OF THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<p>What we have mentioned tonight are items that the Lord has not yet recovered throughout the years. These are crucial items in the recovery. The two passages in 1 Corinthians 14 and Ephesians 4 have never been fulfilled. In addition, there are the two points of the universal priesthood, in which every saint preaches the gospel and brings sinners to God, and of the way of worship in the New Testament, which is not a matter of a physical place but of our spirit. Moreover, there should not be any forms in our worship; rather, we serve by the Spirit of God. Only this kind of living in the spirit with all the saints will match God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In this way, the Body of Christ will be built up, and God&rsquo;s economy will be fulfilled among us. As we said before, all of these matters have not been realized throughout the centuries.</p>
<p>I believe that God is sovereignly speaking these things to us today. If we do not go on faithfully, we will surely delay His timing. However, God must accomplish this eventually. Today, God is reiterating His words in the Bible. His words never fail. They will surely be accomplished on earth. May we be those that receive grace in these matters.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

</ol>
<p>What I am going to speak to you this morning can be considered a condensation of the messages that I have released to you during the past month.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RIGHT IN GOAL AND RIGHT IN METHOD</h2>
<p>I would like to begin this way: throughout the last two thousand years, the way Christians should meet, preach the gospel, serve God, and work for God has been a matter of great debate in Christianity. Much argument and debate has centered around this kind of subject. Until today there is no definite solution. But no matter how the debate has gone, still today there are four main items: 1) preaching the gospel to save people, 2) edifying the new believers, 3) perfecting the more advanced ones, and 4) releasing the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>All four items are recorded in the Bible, but few have discovered the organic terms related to these matters. Although many have read the Bible and have identified these points, they carry them out using Gentile traditions and worldly methods. They have not delved into the depths of the revelation of the Bible. The result, of course, has been natural ways and natural methods. Comparatively speaking, these ways are surely easier to accept. For example, in preaching the gospel, the natural way of Christianity would be to carry out a big gospel campaign, inviting specially trained people to come and speak. This is the way commonly used by worldly societies. Christians have never delved into the way of preaching described in the Bible, nor do they care to do so. Even when they know this way, they are not able to employ it. All that they have adopted are religious and organizational methods, which are not the organic work spoken of in the Bible.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, Peter and the apostles preached the gospel in a prevailing way. As a result, three thousand people were saved. The environment for their preaching was absolutely prepared by the Holy Spirit, who gathered men from all corners of the earth. This is different from the way of Christianity today. Gospel preaching in Christianity, such as that found in many kinds of crusades, employs worldly newspapers, social organizations, political movements, and religious organizations to plan, to coordinate, and to rally people. This is the case not only in gospel preaching; in the edification of the believers, the perfecting of the more advanced ones, and the expounding of biblical truths, the same principle is applied. It is an organizational way, not an organic practice. But the Bible teaches us not only that we must preach the pure and holy word but also that the way we preach it must be holy. The goal must be right; the method must also be right.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WRONG WAY BEING OPPOSED TO GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>For this reason, in the light of the revelation of the Bible, we must consider the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the prophesying in the district meetings as practiced among us in the past year. We must check to see if they are being carried out according to the sanctified way revealed by God or if they are being done according to man&rsquo;s natural ways. Although the things themselves may be the same, the results may differ widely. Take gospel preaching as an example. To call a big meeting and invite a famous speaker to preach is the natural way. Although sinners may be saved, not much help will be rendered as far as the building up of the Body of Christ is concerned. On the contrary, much damage will be done, because such a practice kills the priestly function among the saints in the matter of preaching the gospel. Some great American evangelists have been preaching the gospel for many years. Thousands of souls have been saved. In the end, however, the ministry of the gospel priest has been confined to nearly these evangelists alone. All the others are only Levites. No doubt the gospel is preached and souls are saved, but absolutely no consideration is given to the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In the United States there are sixty million Protestants. At least a third of them are saved and regenerated. That means that there are twenty million Christians. During the past forty years, if they had all practiced what we have seen in these days, everyone would be perfected, and everyone would fulfill his duty as a priest of the New Testament gospel. Every one of them would do the work of an evangelist. Even if each one would have saved only one person per year, in a year, twenty million people would have been saved. In ten years, two hundred million would have been saved, and in forty years, the number would have been staggering. But the opposite has happened. Today the gospel is not sufficiently widespread, and everywhere we see evil, corruption, fornication, and other dark and shameful things. From this we can see that the gospel has indeed been preached, but the way has been wrong. This wrong way is opposed to God&rsquo;s economy and is damaging to God&rsquo;s administration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN AN ORGANIC WAY, RATHER<br />
THAN IN THE WAY OF ATTENDING<br />
A WORSHIP SERVICE</h2>
<p>I say this because I have a burden within. In these end times, the Lord must bring His children absolutely back to the Bible in matters such as meeting, gospel preaching, service to God, and working for God. Strictly speaking, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is a recovery of these things. At this time what concerns me most is whether or not, in this new way of having home meetings and small group meetings and prophesying, we act according to the organic way revealed in the New Testament. According to the result of my studying of the Bible, the small group meeting should include five main items: fellowship, intercession, care, teaching of the truth, and help in the growth in life. The content of every small group meeting should be composed of these five things. Immediately after we come together, we should spontaneously fellowship. The fellowship will bring in the need for intercession, and from this fellowship and intercession the mutual care, concern, and shepherding will develop. After that, there will be some studying and teaching of the truth, with the rendering of some help in life.</p>
<p>At the same time, all this must be done in an organic and spontaneous way. The mutual fellowship should be open and spontaneous. The mutual intercession also should be sincere and spontaneous. It should not be like a religious worship service, in which there are set programs and activities. This kind of organic meeting is what Hebrews 10:25 describes as &ldquo;the assembling of ourselves together.&rdquo; Such a meeting is like a family gathering, with spontaneous, mutual fellowship in which some may ask questions and others may all answer. There is mutual teaching and mutual learning. For example, some may ask about the meaning of bearing the cross. Among the ten or so people in the small group, perhaps some would say that the cross is the terrible means by which the worst criminals were executed at the time of the Roman Empire, and that the Lord Jesus was crucified on such a cross. Another may answer, according to what he knows, that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, we were crucified with Him. In this way, everyone will speak something. The young ones will speak, and the old ones also will speak. Whether a person has been saved for a long time or for a short time, he can speak like all the others. Everyone can contribute whatever he knows. After this, a more experienced one may say that to bear the cross is to remain in the killing of the death of Christ so that our self, our natural life, and the old man are terminated. In only a few minutes, the answer is made clear. This is the small group meeting that we are after.</p>
<p>This kind of meeting matches the organic way described in the Bible. This is much better than the way of meeting that is like one man lecturing in a class. In the small group meeting, when all speak back and forth, in a year&rsquo;s time everyone will have learned, and everyone will be able to speak. In the end, there will be an &ldquo;academic tradition&rdquo; developed among us, and it can be passed on to the next generation. Ultimately, everyone who meets with us will become an able speaker. The new way that the Lord has shown us is not according to man&rsquo;s natural way because the natural way will not accomplish God&rsquo;s desire but will only annul the function of speaking for the Lord. This new way is absolutely organic. It helps us to develop and perfect the life function that is in every believer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STRIVING TO BE FREE FROM TRADITION,<br />
AND LEARNING FAITHFULLY</h2>
<p>In principle, our meetings should not be according to the worldly tradition or the natural way but should be according to the revelation of the Bible. All the members in the Body of Christ should be allowed to function. With the functioning, there is the exercise of the spirit. To exercise the spirit, we must not use man&rsquo;s word but should use the words in the Bible. For this reason, we need to be familiar with the words of the Bible and should soak ourselves in the Lord&rsquo;s word. In this way, when we open up our mouth, the Lord can be spoken forth. This is to prophesy for the Lord. I hope that when you go out to attend the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings, you will strive to be free from tradition. You should not behave according to the worldly tradition or according to your natural preference. You must exercise your spirit, and you must function according to the words of the Bible. In addition, you should have the instant inspiration. In this way, you will supply and nourish others in an organic way.</p>
<p>You are being trained here. In addition to diving into the truth and pursuing after and experiencing life, you should pay special attention to these items of the organic work and should learn conscientiously. You must learn to be a New Testament priest of the gospel, going out to contact people directly, fulfilling the duty of a gospel priest, and saving sinners to offer them up to God as sacrifices. Moreover, you should continue to nourish the new believers, as a nurse would cherish her own children, that they may grow and may be led to present themselves to God as living sacrifices. After that, you still have to perfect them for the building up of the Body of Christ, until they arrive at a full-grown man. In this way, it will be easy for all of them to prophesy, and the church will be built. I hope that you will continue to get into these four items of the organic work and will act not according to the natural way but according to the organic way. May we all do our best to have a part in this, and may we go on faithfully.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

</ol>
<p>In this message we will consider &ldquo;the New Testament priest of the gospel.&rdquo; The term &ldquo;priest of the gospel&rdquo; has been in the Chinese Bible for over a hundred years; it was not noticed by the students of the Bible. I have personally read the Bible for over sixty years. I had not paid attention to this term before either. I have heard many people preaching and have read many spiritual books, but I never heard, nor did I notice this term. It was not until March of this year, while I fellowshipped with the elders in Taipei, that the Holy Spirit enlightened me to see what Paul said in Romans 15:16 concerning being a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TURN FROM THE OLD TESTAMENT PRIESTS<br />
TO THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS</h2>
<p>A priest in the New Testament is a priest of the gospel. The Old Testament priests were mainly confined to the house of Aaron, that is, to Aaron and his sons. But the New Testament priests are not confined to a family. Rather, this priesthood is borne by the millions of saved saints. Revelation 5 says, &ldquo;For You were slain and did purchase to God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and made them to our God a kingdom and priests&rdquo; (vv. 9-10). First Peter 2 also says, &ldquo;But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood&rdquo; (v. 9). Since the priests form a priesthood, it is no longer the responsibility of a few people. Rather, everyone is included in this responsibility. As a result, it becomes a priesthood. The number of saved ones far exceeds the number of Israelites in the Old Testament. The number then was further restricted to males only. In the New Testament all saved persons, whether male or female, young or old, are priests. Because there is a great number of them, they become a priesthood.</p>
<p>What these priests do in their priesthood is to offer up sacrifices to God. In the Old Testament, there were mainly five kinds of offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. In the New Testament, according to Hebrews chapter thirteen the sacrifices offered by the New Testament believers include the sacrifice of praise, the sacrifice of good works, and the sacrifice of material giving. These sacrifices are well pleasing to God. During the past twenty years, I have released many messages in America concerning the New Testament priests offering sacrifices to God. I indicated that this is to offer up the Christ whom we enjoy in many aspects as offerings to God by bringing them to the meetings. In other words, the sacrifices presented to God by the New Testament priests are the Christ that is offered up, that is, the Christ experienced by us and brought and offered up to God.</p>
<p>During the past month, the Lord has shown us that the light concerning the priest of the gospel is not small. This is a great matter in truth. Expositors of the Bible throughout the ages have seen something concerning this matter. Actually, as early as the first century when Paul wrote the book of Hebrews, especially in chapters nine and ten, he was expounding Leviticus already. After the time of Paul, in every age there were people expounding the Bible. This Bible has gone through nineteen hundred years of exposition. Today, we are standing on the shoulders of these expositors. Praise the Lord. Today the revelation concerning the priest of the gospel comes to us. We can say that we have inherited from the past, and we are opening up a way for the future.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Turn in John the Baptist</h2>
<p>We see clearly in John the Baptist that what he offered up was the repentant men. We see this clearly also in the Apostle Paul. The offerings he offered up were the sinners saved through him. We all know that the Bible is divided into the Old and the New Testaments. Most of what is recorded covers the service of God by His people. The Bible says that we are created, selected, and redeemed by God. We are also regenerated and transformed by God. The reason God brings man through all these processes is that man would serve Him. Hence both the Old and the New Testament tell us man&rsquo;s obligation to serve God. He must be a priest. In both Testaments, the people of God are the priests. The difference between the two Testaments lies in the offerings that the priests in the two ages offer.</p>
<p>The turn of the priesthood from the Old Testament to the New happened with John the Baptist. According to the record of Luke chapter one, John came from a priestly family of the Old Testament. His father was old and had no child. The husband and wife prayed to God, and God answered their prayer. A son was given to them, who was John the Baptist. Officially speaking, John was a born priest. Not only was he a priest born of a priestly family, he was a genuine priest born through the power of God. The last Old Testament priest who counted in God&rsquo;s eyes was Zachariah. Outwardly speaking, John was born into a priestly family. Being born a priest of the Old Testament, he should have lived in the priestly home, walking in and out of the temple. He should have been eating the priestly offerings and wearing the priestly garments. But strangely enough, John went to preach in the wilderness. He rejected the priestly family, turned away from the temple, and would not even slaughter the bulls and goats for offerings. He rejected everything that the Old Testament priests did.</p>
<p>He did not put on the priestly garments. Instead, he put on camel&rsquo;s hair. He did not eat any offerings. Instead, he ate wild locusts and honey. He did not live in the temple; he lived in the wilderness. His ways were fully free from the traditions of the Old Testament priests. He dressed wildly, ate wildly, lived wildly, and even preached wildly. He told those who came out to him to be baptized, &ldquo;Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?&rdquo; He cried in the wilderness: &ldquo;Repent!&rdquo; After men repented, he baptized them into the water. All of what John did was fully free from any cultural or religious background. He rejected entirely the priesthood of the Old Testament. He turned away from the old and turned to the new. Through such a turn he was brought into the function of the first priest of the gospel in the New Testament.</p>
<p>When John turned to become the first gospel priest of God in the New Testament, he did not offer bulls and goats for sacrifices. Instead, he offered the repentant sinners as sacrifices. He did not offer individual bulls. Rather, he offered the saved souls one by one. He replaced the bulls and goats with men.</p>
<p>All the believers after John the Baptist including Peter, James, John, and the three thousand and the five thousand added during the time of Pentecost were priests of the gospel. Every one of them offered up sinners as sacrifices. The first group of apostles set up by the Lord were the first group of priests of the gospel. After them, the most outstanding one was the Apostle Paul. In Romans chapter fifteen he said that he was &ldquo;a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 16). Paul saved the Gentile sinners one by one, and offered them up to God. This was the first step.</p><h2 class="head2">Continuing through the Apostles<br />
and Every Believer</h2>
<p>The second step was for Paul to meet in the homes of the newly saved believers. We can see this from the book of Romans. First, in chapter one Paul talked about the content of the gospel. After that, in chapters two and three, there is the initial gospel for the home meetings. Following that, from chapter four to chapter eleven, he talked about the walk of a believer in Christ. This was probably a message for a small group meeting of the local saints. Then, in chapter twelve, in verses 4 and 5, he said that as there are many members in one body, and all the members do not have the same function, so also we all are one Body in Christ, and severally members one of another. Possibly this is a development from the group meeting to the district meeting. Here, Paul encouraged the saints to prophesy in the meetings. He said, &ldquo;And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them accordingly: whether prophecy, according to the proportion of faith&rdquo; (v. 6).</p>
<p>Paul did not cover prophesying in chapter one. In chapter one, he talked about everyone having sinned and being in need of the gospel. In chapter two, he talked about the Jews having sinned. In chapter three, he talked about all having sinned and come short of the glory of God (v. 23). In chapter four, he talked about circumcision. In chapter five, he talked about the different inheritances in Adam and in Christ. Chapter by chapter, he went on to expound and teach the Roman believers. By chapter twelve, he mentioned prophesying. We can say that Paul began in Romans with the preaching of the gospel, proceeded on to the home meetings, then to the group meetings, and finally ended with the district meetings. He was helping the ones under his teaching to prophesy in the meetings.</p>
<p>It is as if Paul was saying: &ldquo;Formerly I brought you the gospel of salvation and offered you to God as sacrifices. Now you have been nourished and have grown through the home meetings. You have also attended the group meetings and have been perfected there. Now you have to prophesy in the meetings, offering yourselves up as living sacrifices.&rdquo; Paul led the believers under his care to present themselves as living sacrifices. He also presented these perfected saints full-grown in Christ to God in all wisdom. &ldquo;Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power&rdquo; (Col. 1:28-29).</p>
<h2 class="head2">With All Believers as the Components<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Priesthood of the Gospel</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4 tells us that Paul desired that all the saints would arrive at a full-grown man (v. 13). He desired that all the saints would be perfected and be able to do the work of the ministry, for the building up of the Body of Christ. There are three steps to Paul&rsquo;s work as a priest of the gospel. First, he preached the gospel to save and bring in the sinners. Second, he perfected the newly saved people that they would offer themselves up. Third, he warned and taught in all wisdom until these believers became mature in Christ; then he presented them full-grown. For this he labored.</p>
<p>Paul did not say that he worked for this. Rather he said that he labored for this. It is not enough for us just to work. We have to labor as well, struggling and striving according to the operation which He operates within us. Our struggling does not depend on our own strength. Rather, it is according to the operation of Him who operates within us. We all have had the experience that no matter how tired and discouraged we are, after we kneel down and pray for a few minutes, we feel a great power operating within us. This is similar to what Paul describes in Colossians 1:27 when he says that Christ in us is the hope of glory. This Christ who was the life and person in Paul&rsquo;s spirit was the means whereby Paul labored. It was through the operation of this power that he labored, struggled, and strived, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, to present every man full-grown in Christ to God. This is what we hope to see.</p>
<p>Since 1984, I have been coming to Taiwan twice a year. What I hope to see is that all of you would be able to be presented full-grown. Now, we are not doing poorly with the first step of bringing people to salvation. The second step, which is to perfect people by the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings, is still less than ideal. We are like students studying diligently, but having not yet graduated. Since the introduction of the new way during the past four years, thousands of brothers and sisters in Taipei have given themselves to the small groups aggressively. Because we are in a laboratory, we constantly change the way of practice. I also know that some have not been able to take this. I want to tell you that the Old Testament exhorts us not to be an unturned cake. In all these changes, you have all been turned. Today you are no longer unturned cakes. Now your spirit in the meeting is much different from what it was four years ago. When I listen to your singing and speaking, I realize that your spirit has definitely improved. But we must advance to the stage which Paul described, a stage in which our inner man is daily renewed.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR<br />
THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL<br />
TO FULFILL THEIR DUTY</h2>
<p>Paul is a pattern to every one of us. He brought the gospel with him and visited the sinners by knocking on their doors, pleading with them to receive the gospel. Once a sinner receives the gospel, angels in God&rsquo;s presence sing until the courts of heaven ring. In the record of Luke 15, the Lord Jesus said that there were a hundred sheep, and one was lost. When the shepherd found the lost sheep, he called together his friends and neighbors to rejoice with him (v. 6). The Lord Jesus also mentioned the parable of a woman who had lost her coin. The woman lit the lamp, swept the house, and sought carefully until she found it. When she found it, she called together her friends and neighbors and said, &ldquo;Rejoice with me&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). Hence, we have to know that to bring a sinner to salvation is not a small thing. It is a tremendously great thing. We must consider this seriously. Everyone has to bring people to salvation. This is to fulfill the duty of the priest of the gospel.</p>
<p>Bringing people to salvation only brings us through chapter four of Romans. We cannot stop there; we have to go on. By chapter twelve of Romans, not only do the new ones have home meetings, they are being perfected in the small group meetings as well. Then they have to go on to prophesy in the meetings. This is not easy to accomplish. Hence, there is the need for laboring. We have to struggle according to the operation of Christ&rsquo;s power within until the saints can be presented full-grown in Christ to God. We must arrive at this point before the duty of the New Testament priest of the gospel can be considered as completed. When we perfect people this way, the ones being perfected will in turn perfect others. Then those other perfected ones will go to visit people by knocking on doors, will set up home meetings in the homes of the newly saved ones, and will also bring people to attend small group meetings and to prophesy in the district meetings.</p>
<p>In this way, what you have done in others in the way of perfecting is fully duplicated by them in more new ones. Men will be brought back to the flock and will be presented full-grown in Christ to God. Everyone will be a priest of the gospel. In the church there is no pastor or preacher; neither are there any spiritual giants. We are all ordinary believers. Yet we are all priests of the gospel. Everyone goes to knock on doors, and everyone brings in sinners as offerings. Following that, we have to read to them Romans chapters one to four. Gradually, when they have been established, we must bring them to the small group meetings and help them to experience chapter eight, the walking in spirit in all things (v. 5). In this way, they will be qualified to offer themselves up as living sacrifices to serve God. The practice of the new way is to make everyone a priest of the gospel. In the old way only a few people are the priests; the ordinary believers are not priests in their daily lives. They only go when there is a gospel meeting, and they drag people to listen to the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every New Testament Believer Needing to Personally Preach the Gospel by Visiting People</h2>
<p>Today I have only one burden, which is to tell you that you have to be a priest of the gospel. Not only do the brothers have to do it. The sisters have to do it as well. Even the young sisters should do the same. There is no pastor among us; neither are there preachers. We only have all the saints serving as priests of the gospel, bringing in the sinners. This cannot be secured by any amount of money. There is no other way to accomplish this except by visiting people personally through knocking on doors. We must be bold to proclaim the gospel loudly. Whether you have been trained or not, you are a priest of the gospel, and you have to preach the gospel to others. This is the universal priesthood. It is not the priesthood of a few people. Do not be afraid that you cannot preach, and do not say that you cannot preach. The reason you cannot preach is that you do not preach, and the reason you are afraid to preach is also that you do not preach. The more you preach, the more you will be able to preach.</p>
<p>The Bible states that each one of us, the saved believers, should be a priest of the gospel. In the past, we were influenced by Christianity to depend on the gifted evangelists, while we ourselves only stood by the side to help in ushering, writing down names, and other Levitical services. We did not fulfill the duty of the priest of the gospel. This way is an offense to God. From now on, I hope that all the five thousand regular attendants in the church in Taipei would all be priests of the gospel. There is no need to gather together at the meeting hall for the preaching. You can take the Bible and go out to preach by yourself. You can also take one or two other companions to go along with you. You have to knock on every one of the hundreds of thousands of doors in Taipei to send the precious gospel to people.</p>
<p>Nineteen centuries ago, Paul did not have convenient means of transportation. Yet he traveled by boat across the seas, taking long journeys far from home and paying the price to send the gospel out. Acts chapter sixteen shows us that when Paul was in Philippi, no saint was there to greet him. There was not a church to receive him. He did not know anybody there. What he did was to go outside the city to the riverside on the Sabbath where there was a place of prayer. He then sat down and talked with the women gathered there. One of them was a woman by the name of Lydia who sold purple cloth. She and her whole household were saved and baptized. She then asked Paul to stay in her home (vv. 13-15). This was how Paul began his gospel preaching in Philippi. In the house of Lydia a home meeting was set up, and the church in Philippi began this way. What Paul did is a pattern to all the believers. We all should learn from him. What he did is what we all should do. We should be the same as he was.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As Branches of the Vine, Being Sent<br />
Forth to Bear Fruit, This Being a Work<br />
Not to Be Replaced by Others&rsquo; Labor</h2>
<p>In Acts 20, Paul sailed to Miletus. There he sent for the elders in Ephesus and told them that he &ldquo;did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house...for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears&rdquo; (vv. 20, 31). This was how Paul labored, struggled, and strived to perfect the Ephesian believers. We have been in Taiwan for forty years. If we had been laboring in the way that Paul did, struggling and striving to perfect the saints, Taiwan would have been evangelized long ago. We have not done so because we have been damaged by the old system. Now we have to go back to the biblical way. Everyone is a New Testament priest of the gospel. There is no longer a need to depend on anyone else. We can all preach the gospel, bring people to salvation, and offer up the sinners to God by ourselves. Then set up home meetings in the homes of the newly saved ones. After they are established, bring them to the small group meetings and teach them the truth, nourishing, perfecting, and instructing them until they can offer up themselves as living sacrifices to God and are able to prophesy one by one in the meetings. In the end, whatever you can do, they can do also. We have to ask the Lord to grant us the grace that we would be able to bear at least one fruit per year to offer to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">This Being the Way Ordained by God<br />
and Revealed in the Bible</h2>
<p>I believe that from tonight on, everyone will see clearly that every believer is a New Testament priest of the gospel and must personally preach the gospel by visiting people through knocking on doors, that the sinners may be saved and may be offered up to God as sacrifices. We are like the branches of the vine sent by the Lord to go forth to bear fruit. This work cannot be replaced by anyone else&rsquo;s labor. This is ordained by God, and this is the way revealed in the Bible. As priests of the gospel, we should go and preach the gospel. Whether we are capable or not, this is our destiny. No one will preach the gospel for us, or bear fruit for us. The fruit of others are on their own accounts.</p>
<p>Since we are the branches of the Lord, we must personally bear fruit to God. This is our duty. This is also our glory. As 1 Peter 2:9 says, we are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, for the telling out of the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light. If we labor according to the Bible, struggling and striving as Paul did for the gospel, perhaps hundreds of thousands of sinners will have been saved by us when we see the Lord. This is not a small thing. This will accomplish the eternal purpose of the Lord and will realize His economy among us. May the Lord be merciful to us, deliver us out of the old way that kills the organic functions, and bring us into this new way that takes us out of death into life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<p>Prayer: Lord, our hearts rejoice and our spirits praise. In this last age You have given us Your revelation in such a deep, far-reaching, and clear way. Lord, You have gathered us together here tonight to study Your holy Word. We are open to You. We call on You in a humble way. Lord, speak an intimate word to us. Although we are young and weak, You are strong and mighty within us. Lord Jesus, may we know You. We do not depend on ourselves, nor do we look at ourselves. We look only to You. Thank You that You have shown us so clearly Your ordained way which is the way revealed in the Bible.</p>
<p>Lord, draw us again tonight that we would run after You. Put Your burden within each one of us that we would all receive Your burden to finish the course You have set for us and to be persons after Your heart and for Your pleasure.</p>
<p>Lord, grant us ears to hear. May You be with our speaking. May You be one spirit with us in our speaking. Lord, vindicate Your own way and confirm Your own words. We call on You in one accord on the ground of the church. While we call on You, You have to do something for Yourself. Lord, we accuse Your enemy. You have to destroy him. Remove his power of darkness. Lord, deliver all of us from his hands and his bondage. We want to give You the glory and give him the shame. May blessing and building be with the saints and the church. Amen!</p>
<p>The first work of the priest of the gospel in the New Testament is to visit people personally and bring in sinners to offer to God as sacrifices. After this first step there are still three more responsibilities. These are my burden for tonight. Let me begin with a word of introduction. Christianity today is a great religion. There are millions of Christians throughout the world. They can be divided mainly into three categories: the first is Roman Catholicism, the second is the different denominations of Protestantism such as the Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, the Episcopalians, the Lutherans, etc., and the third is the free groups. These free groups belong neither to the Catholic Church nor to the Protestant denominations. Although they can be considered a part of Protestantism they do not belong to the big denominations of Protestantism. They are scattered and free. Today on the whole earth, whether it be the Catholics, the Protestants, or the free groups, and although each has their own way of serving God, all three groups are the same.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERY NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVER BEING<br />
A PRIEST OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In the New Testament God ordains that every believer should be a priest of the gospel. Moreover, the service of the gospel priest is a priesthood. Every believer has to be a priest from the time that he is saved. A priest is one who serves God. The New Testament priest is a gospel-preaching priest; that is, he is a priest that serves God in the gospel. This is not the duty of a few people. Rather, it is the universal responsibility of all the saints. This, however, is not what we see in Christianity today. Christianity employs a few clergymen who have studied theology and have learned some biblical truth to serve God. These clergymen are only a minority among all the believers. Most of the others are considered laymen.</p>
<p>What about the situation among us? We have had the proper teaching among us in the past, but there was not the practice. We said that we are all New Testament priests of the gospel and that as priests we should offer up gospel sacrifices. The gospel sacrifices are not bulls and goats; rather, they are the saved sinners. When you save a sinner and offer him up to God as a sacrifice, you are a priest of the gospel. Paul said in Romans 15:16, &ldquo;That I should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable.&rdquo; Paul said that as a priest of the gospel, he offered up the nations to God as offerings, which are the sinners saved through his gospel.</p>
<p>Perhaps you would say, &ldquo;But this is Paul. I cannot do the same thing.&rdquo; This is a &ldquo;feudalistic&rdquo; mentality, one under an ecclesiastical and clerical concept. It is &ldquo;feudalism&rdquo; within Christianity. Paul said that as far as being a Christian is concerned, he was less than the least of all saints. On the other hand, according to the Bible, God chose Paul to be the pattern to all those who believe in the Lord Jesus. Since he was a pattern, whatever he did should be done by us. Whatever he could do, we should also be able to do.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WRONG SYSTEM PARALYZING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Our way in the past was wrong. Whenever we talked about preaching the gospel, we considered that a certain brother would stand on the platform to release a message. He was the one that had the ecclesiastical position and clerical power. As to the other brothers and sisters, their job was just to help that one to lead the songs, pray, and read the Scripture. Some would also help in cleaning the hall, arranging the chairs, inviting the friends, and preparing the love feasts. During the time of the meeting, they did not have to say anything. All they needed to do was to help the gospel friends turn the pages of the Bible and hymn book and help them write down their names after the meeting. Because we took the wrong way, the gospel service which should have been for everyone was left to a few who were capable in preaching the gospel. The rest of the brothers and sisters all became Levites. This was a deception of the enemy.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s wisdom He wants everyone to be a priest. Satan&rsquo;s deception is not to stop people from preaching the gospel entirely. Rather, it is to turn God&rsquo;s wise way into human ways. God wants every saved person to be a living member of the Body of Christ, but man&rsquo;s way is to invite big evangelists to conduct campaigns. All of the other believers then become the Levites helping in miscellaneous affairs. Everyone depends on the particular one to preach the gospel. There is no need to go out to knock on doors or learn to speak. In this way everyone&rsquo;s spiritual function is killed. Even today many Christians still do not know how to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s Christianity can be considered half paralyzed. Among us, four and a half years ago, the situation was similar. I observed the situation and knew that the condition was wrong. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery had fallen into a condition of stagnation, and there was no progress. Although through our publications the Lord&rsquo;s recovery was sent to all the continents of the world, the rate of increase and spread in all the churches was not satisfactory. Hence, I knew that our condition was wrong. This stagnant condition was a sign. I cast aside all considerations and dropped the work in the West to come to Taiwan. I have spent the past four years specifically on the study of the new way. I have re-studied the Bible and reconsidered church history as well as the practices among us.</p><h2 class="head1">FOUR STEPS OF THE NEW WAY&mdash;<br />
BEGETTING, NOURISHING, TEACHING, BUILDING</h2>
<p>There have been over sixty years of history among us. I was personally involved in the last fifty years, and I am very much aware of the true situation. During the four and a half years that I was in Taipei, the Lord gradually showed me the truth in the Bible. I have made note of these crucial verses in the New Testament according to what I saw. I have told you before that there are four steps that we have to study in the new way. The training center is a laboratory. The first step that we have to study is the preaching of the gospel. The second step is the nourishing of the new believers. The third step is to teach and perfect them that they may become useful. These three steps are the begetting, the nourishing, and the teaching. There is a fourth step which is the building.</p>
<p>The words beget, nourish, and teach can all be found in the Bible. For example, Paul said, &ldquo;I have begotten you through the gospel&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:15). He did not say &ldquo;saved you,&rdquo; but &ldquo;begotten&rdquo; you. What you need is the life of God. By dispensing the life of God into you, I beget you. After begetting there is the nourishing. The Lord said to Peter in John 21, &ldquo;Do you love Me?...Feed My lambs&rdquo; (v. 15). Paul also said, &ldquo;But we were gentle in your midst, as a nurse would cherish her own children&rdquo; (1 Thes. 2:7). The most important work of a nurse is to nourish the baby. Paul cared for the saints like a nursing mother would care for her own baby. Peter said to the saints in 1 Peter 2:2 that believers should &ldquo;as newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation.&rdquo; When a new one is born he needs to be nourished. Only then will he grow. The third step is the teaching. Paul said that he was not just a nursing mother to nourish and cherish, but a father to entreat, console, and teach. Ephesians chapter four says, &ldquo;And He gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). Teaching perfects people. In this way not only do the saints grow in Christ, but they also mature in life.</p>
<p>After the saints are perfected, have knowledge in the truth, and have the experience in life, they will spontaneously be able to speak for God, that is, to prophesy. First Corinthians 14 shows us that prophesying is the most excelling gift because it builds up the church. Christianity has taken the easy way. They train special ones to be the pastors to preach and give a sermon every week for edifying the believers. This is a wrong way. There should not be the replacement of many by one. Instead, everyone should be working because 1 Corinthians 14:31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way that Christianity takes is one which avoids the difficult and chooses the easy. It establishes the one but replaces the many. This is wrong. What we see in the Bible is not like this. The Bible exhorts all of us to speak and all of us to prophesy. Although we may not do too well at the beginning, as long as we lay a good foundation, it will be easy later. The old system makes a person lazy, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery everyone has to be diligent to strive and pursue seriously. Everyone has to pray-read, enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s word, and fellowship with the Lord in His word. There is also the need to allow Christ to grow in us. But this is not all. We have to go and preach the gospel, nourish the newly saved ones, and perfect them in the small group meetings so that they will learn to prophesy in the district meetings.</p>
<p>Let us now take a look at the outline. After preaching the gospel to save sinners and offering them up to God as sacrifices, there are still three big steps to be taken.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING WITH THE NEW BELIEVERS IN THEIR HOMES</h2>
<p>When you have a home meeting with the new believers, never assume that you know how to have such a meeting. You must learn to have a home meeting. God is a creating God. He can create; He does not have to learn. But every human being needs to learn. You have to realize that in order to take care of a meeting in a new believer&rsquo;s home, you must first learn.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Feeding Them as the Lord&rsquo;s Lambs<br />
That Our Fruit May Remain</h2>
<p>We should consider the new ones as the Lord&rsquo;s lambs and feed them accordingly. This feeding will cause your fruit to remain. In the past, after we baptized people there was a lack in feeding. Therefore, in the end many were lost. Now when we go to the home meetings we must feed them properly. In this way they will remain.</p><h2 class="head2">As a Nursing Mother<br />
Cherishing Her Own Children</h2>
<p>When you preach the gospel you beget as a father. After begetting, you immediately nourish as a nursing mother.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading Them:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">To Know the Lord</h2>
<p>First, lead the new ones to know the four aspects of the Lord: to know Him as God (Rom. 9:5), to know Him as Man (1 Tim. 2:5), to know Him as the Savior, as well as the Redeemer (Luke 2:11), and to know Him as the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). After you have learned these four aspects you should not teach others in a legal way. Rather, talk to them spontaneously. Perhaps you can speak these points in four messages. In the first message help them to know that the Lord is God. Then help them to know that the Lord is Man, that He is the God-man. Following that, help them to know that this God-man is our Savior and our Redeemer. In the end, help them to see that this Lord has become the life-giving Spirit and is now living in us. If they want to know more, there are many books among us concerning all of these items. You can introduce all of these books and publications to them.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Know the Lord&rsquo;s Salvation</h2>
<p>After they know the person of the Lord, you have to help them know the salvation of the Lord. The Lord has redeemed us with His precious blood and saved us by His life. The redemptive aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation has been accomplished. But He is still saving us daily in life. Redemption by the blood and deliverance in life added together equal the Lord&rsquo;s salvation for us. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation includes both the redemption by the blood and the daily deliverance in His life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Know That<br />
They Have the Life of the Lord</h2>
<p>After this you have to lead them to know that they themselves have the life of the Lord. Formerly they only had the human life. Now that they are saved they have the life of the Lord. Furthermore, their spirit has been regenerated by the Lord Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Exercise Their Spirit<br />
to Call On the Lord, to Pray,<br />
and to Take In the Lord&rsquo;s Riches</h2>
<p>If you want to lead them to exercise their spirit, you must first exercise your own spirit. You must not only lead them to know that He is the Spirit and that they have a spirit, you must also demonstrate that you are a person that uses your spirit and speaks from your spirit. Then you should help them use their spirit, pray with their spirit, and call on the name of the Lord from their spirit to take in the Lord&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Enjoy the Milk of the Lord&rsquo;s Word in the Bible and to Grow in Life</h2>
<p>You should also lead them to enjoy the milk of the Lord&rsquo;s word by using some verses in the Bible. This kind of enjoyment will help them to grow in life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Consecrate Themselves<br />
as Living Sacrifices to God</h2>
<p>When they were saved you offered them up to God as sacrifices. However, at that time it was you who offered them. After you have nourished them and they have grown in life, you have to tell them that now they have to offer themselves to the Lord as living sacrifices. Romans 12 says, &ldquo;I beg you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well-pleasing to God, which is your most reasonable service&rdquo; (v. 1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">This Being the Pattern<br />
Revealed in the New Testament</h2>
<p>Acts 5:42 says that every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING SMALL GROUP MEETINGS<br />
THAT ARE FULL OF MUTUALITY WITH THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>The small group meeting is different from the home meeting. After people are saved and have been led and fed for a while, they should come together. Their meeting together is the small group meeting. Do not wait too long to bring them to the small group meetings. At the same time you are feeding them, bring them to the small group meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading, Enlightening, and<br />
Encouraging the Saints:</h2>
<h2 class="head3">To Open Up and Fellowship with One Another</h2>
<p>The Chinese are taught from their youth by their families that they should speak little. Therefore, the Chinese never like to open their mouths in public. It is very difficult to get the sisters to speak in the meetings; therefore, we have to encourage them to open up. When Christians come together, as long as they open their mouths, there is the benefit. It always helps when things are talked out and fellowshipped among each other.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Pray for One Another</h2>
<p>Perhaps one sister sees another sister coming to the meeting. She may say, &ldquo;Sister, please pray for me. This morning I hurt my shoulder.&rdquo; By then, two other sisters may come in. This sister may tell the other two about it. The two may say, &ldquo;Let us pray!&rdquo; In this way, they start praying for the troubled sister. This is prayer concerning physical needs. Sometimes the prayer can be about spiritual needs. One brother may feel that he just cannot break through in prayer. Another brother may say, &ldquo;Have you committed any sin, or have you loved the world? Is it due to sin or the world in you that your prayer is blocked?&rdquo; Before he finishes his words, a few sisters may pray, &ldquo;Lord, enlighten our brother that he would see within.&rdquo; Once our mouth is open, spontaneously, there is the fellowship; and once there is the fellowship, spontaneously, there is the mutual prayer for one another.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Care For and Shepherd One Another</h2>
<p>When brothers and sisters fellowship and pray together, there is the mutual care and shepherding.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Mutually Ask Questions for<br />
Learning and Teaching the Truth<br />
and<br />
To Mutually Ask Questions for the<br />
Pursuit of and Instruction in the Growth in Life</h2>
<p>Some may ask in the meeting, &ldquo;What is the meaning of bearing the cross?&rdquo; Among the seven or eight persons present, each may say a little. One brother may say, &ldquo;The cross was the tool of execution for the most severe criminals in the Roman Empire.&rdquo; Another may say, &ldquo;When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, we were all crucified with Him. Hence, we should remain in His death, and should not come down from the cross. This is the meaning of bearing the cross.&rdquo; This way of speaking allows everyone to learn the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Entreating and Consoling the Saints as a Father</h2>
<h2 class="head3"> Teaching the Saints All the Counsel of God</h2>
<p>In Acts 20 Paul said, &ldquo;I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house&rdquo; (v. 20). &ldquo;For I did not shrink from declaring to you all the counsel of God&rdquo; (v. 27). &ldquo;Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease admonishing each one with tears&rdquo; (v. 31).</p>
<h2 class="head3">In All Wisdom, Presenting the Saints<br />
Full-grown in Christ to God</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ&rdquo; (Col. 1:28). Paul not only hoped that the saints would grow in life, but he warned and taught every man in all wisdom, that they might be presented full-grown in Christ to God.</p><h2 class="head3">Equipping and Supplying the Saints<br />
to Do the Work of the New Testament Ministry, Which Is to Build Up the Organic Body of Christ</h2>
<p>All of you have to learn to teach the saints. This does not mean teaching them in the meeting, but teaching them one by one in the homes during your visitation. This kind of teaching requires time. You may first pick out from among the brothers and sisters those whom you can lead on more easily. If you perfect two each week, in half a year, you will be able to perfect quite a few. In your small group a few will become capable, and the others will follow and learn. In this way, a good foundation will be laid. I have seen clearly that the success of the new way depends on some willing ones who learn first, and then in turn, pick up the burden to teach others.</p>
<p>In this matter, the full-time co-workers bear a big responsibility. Not only should they teach in the meetings, but they have to go to the homes of the saints and teach them mouth to mouth and one by one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Assigning the Saints<br />
to Go to Preach the Gospel by Visiting People,<br />
to Nourish and Care for the New Ones,<br />
to Lead the Believers to Attend<br />
the Small Group Meetings,<br />
to Lead the Believers to Attend<br />
the Bigger Meetings of the Church</h2>
<p>Those who are under our care in a small group must be able to do what we do. This kind of small group meeting will surely increase in number. When the number increases, we can subdivide the group. The small group meeting is the main part of the practice of the church life. In other words, the practical church life exists in the small groups. You may say that the small group meeting almost equals the church life. The small group has the ability to perfect people, helping them to know the truth, to grow in life, and to function organically. In this way, they will also be able to do what we can do. This is the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ATTENDING MEETINGS OF THE CHURCH<br />
THAT ARE FULL OF MUTUAL SPEAKING AND LISTENING</h2>
<p>Meetings of mutual speaking and listening are the prophesying meetings. The church in Taipei now practices this in the district meetings. In this kind of meeting, everyone has something to supply. In addition, all the prophesying in the meetings is for the building up of the saints and the church. Your prophesying is to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord&rsquo;s riches. Moreover, you have to speak the Lord into people. Hence, there is the need to fully supply others with the riches of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Goal of the Function<br />
of the New Testament Priests of the Gospel</h2>
<p>When the saints are perfected to grow into maturity, being edified in truth and having the experience in life, they are enabled to prophesy. In this way Christ will be supplied to all His members, and the church will be built up organically. The preaching of the gospel by the priests of the gospel to gain sinners for an offering to God, their caring for and nourishing of the new ones, their leading them to grow in life and to present themselves living sacrifices to God, their perfecting of the saints by teaching them in all wisdom, and their presenting them full-grown in Christ to God, are all done for this one goal.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Consummation of the Function<br />
of the New Testament Priests of the Gospel</h2>
<p>Prophesying is to speak for God for the building up of the church. This is the excelling gift among all gifts in the New Testament and is to be earnestly desired by those saints desiring spiritual gifts. It is what every believer can and must do.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, these are the crucial verses concerning the new way, the way ordained by the Lord, revealed in the Bible, and discovered by us through our research during the last four and a half years. I have presented them to you to give you a full picture. Since all of you love the Lord, I hope that you would spend some time to pursue and to learn these things. Sooner or later the Lord will have to recover the new way, for this is the word spoken by the Lord in the Bible. In the end times, I believe that the Lord will do this. If we are lazy and loose, we may delay the Lord&rsquo;s work. But the Lord will not be delayed by man forever. Sooner or later He will find a group of people who put the new way into practice that His will may be fulfilled, that the church may be built, and that the bride of Christ may be fully prepared.</p>
<p>Please press on with this determination in mind. Beginning today, the elders and co-workers should pick up this heavy burden. You should teach not only in the meetings, but one by one in every home. The secret of the three levels of meetings&mdash;the home meetings, the group meetings, and the district meetings&mdash;lies in your willingness to learn to teach. Let me repeat that this way is absolutely correct. If you and I are faithful and diligent, it will succeed among us. I believe it will succeed.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:28-29; Rom. 12:11; 1 Cor. 15:58</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, for the accomplishment of Your economy, You need us. But for us to fulfill it, we need You all the more. Lord, without You, we are just vanity. Be gracious to us, and give us further words tonight. Lord, may we all have open fellowship one with another. Lord, may You release Your words among us and even in us. Amen.</p>
<p>Tonight I want to fellowship with you some practical words. After four years of studying the new way, the Lord has brought us through four steps.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE ORGANISM<br />
PRODUCED BY THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>First, the Lord has shown us that His Body is an organism. It is something of life, by life, and through life. It is entirely organic and has absolutely nothing to do with anything organizational.</p>
<p>Last summer, the Lord showed us that the Body of Christ is an organism and it is produced by the processed Triune God. If we read Ephesians chapter one carefully, we will see that from the processed Triune God the Body of Christ is produced. All that Christ has attained is transmitted to the church. The incarnation of Christ, His human living, death and resurrection, ascension, and His transcending over all things are transmitted to the church. Hence, verse 22 says, &ldquo;And He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.&rdquo; After the church is produced, verse 23 continues on to say that the church &ldquo;is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; From this we see that this church is the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO RECOVER<br />
EPHESIANS 4 AND 1 CORINTHIANS 14</h2>
<p>Second, we must recover the condition of Ephesians 4:11-16 and 1 Corinthians 14. Ephesians 4 speaks of the gifts perfecting the saints for the work of the New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the organic Body of Christ. This must be recovered not only because it is the Lord&rsquo;s word and therefore must be fulfilled but also because without this it is impossible for the Body of Christ to be built on earth and for the bride of the Lord to be prepared. At the same time, the Lord has shown us that everyone has to prophesy in the church meeting (1 Cor. 14:24) that all the saints may learn and be encouraged. In this way, the church will be built.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14 are two chapters that occupy a special place. One of these chapters mentions the building up of the Body of Christ; the other chapter mentions the building up of the church. In the New Testament, you cannot find another passage like these two chapters which speak so definitely concerning the building up of the Body of Christ and of the church. The Lord Jesus did say in the Gospels that &ldquo;on this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). But this word is very general. It is not clearly explained. Ephesians 4, however, is different. It presents and points out to us the whole blueprint. First Corinthians 14 mentions the building up of the church five times. This chapter can be considered as being specifically for the building. The key to building is nothing other than prophesying. The Lord spoke such definite words through Paul. This word must be fulfilled, and the Lord&rsquo;s church must be built up practically.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
PRIESTHOOD OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Recently, the Lord has further shown us the New Testament priesthood of the gospel. The New Testament priests are a priesthood. The priesthood is not something that belongs to a few people. Rather, it is universal and belongs to all the believers. Every New Testament believer is a priest. Moreover, they are not priests individually; rather, they form a priesthood. The word <em>priesthood</em> is a strong word in the New Testament. It is also a word that is difficult to translate. The Chinese Union Version did not translate it properly. This word is used twice in 1 Peter chapter two, in verse 5 and in verse 9. Verse 5 says, &ldquo;Into a holy priesthood&rdquo; and verse 9 says, &ldquo;But you are...a royal priesthood.&rdquo; The Chinese Union Version translated this only as &ldquo;holy priests&rdquo; and &ldquo;royal priests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The priests are for the offering and managing of sacrifices. Without sacrifices, there is no need to have priests. The Old Testament priests offered bulls and goats as sacrifices. What then do the New Testament priests offer as sacrifices? First Peter 2:5 says &ldquo;to offer up spiritual sacrifices.&rdquo; What are these spiritual sacrifices? Hebrews chapter thirteen says that praise is one kind of sacrifice to God. Good works and material giving are also sacrifices. But these are not the main sacrifices. The main sacrifices are the sinners saved through our gospel preaching. These sinners were originally in Adam and apart from Christ. But after they are saved and transferred into Christ, they become sacrifices offered to God.</p>
<p>Every saint should be God&rsquo;s priest of the gospel and should do the work of preaching the gospel. This is truly a great light. Formerly, some said that door knocking is good but that there is not just one way to preach the gospel. Today, we see clearly that if you do not use the proper, biblical way to preach the gospel, you may bring in sinners, but you have acted contrary to the principle of God&rsquo;s economy. For example, some famous evangelists have preached the gospel and brought thousands to salvation. But their way does not render much help to the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. On the contrary, it has annulled the organic function of many Christians in preaching the gospel. If during the past forty years they would have acted according to what is recorded in Ephesians chapter four in perfecting the believers to do the work of preaching the gospel, perhaps today there would be over a million believers in America that had been perfected by them, who would all be able to do the work of preaching the gospel. Unfortunately, this has not been the case.</p>
<p>The biblical way demands that every believer, that is, every member of the Body of Christ be living. Is there a body that has only a few members moving while all the other members are not moving? This can never be unless that body is paralyzed. However, the Christianity that we see today is indeed in this condition. The Body that God has prepared for His Son, Christ, has been paralyzed by Christianity. This is why, I believe, the Lord has opened our eyes to see that the Body of Christ is a living organism, that we may learn to sympathize with His desires. He is indeed sick of the situation in Christianity which paralyzes the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; FOUR MAJOR STEPS<br />
IN THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The light which the Lord has shown us concerning the way revealed in the New Testament for believers to meet and serve can be divided into the following four major steps. First, you must personally go out to visit people, to preach the gospel to bring them to salvation, and to bring these sinners as offerings to God. Second, nourish and care for the new believers. This is not the exclusive job of the elders and co-workers. Rather, it is the duty of every saint. Third, teach and perfect. Not only should the gifted ones perfect. Even more, when you have been perfected by the gifted ones, you also should be a perfecter of others. Hence, you yourselves must go and perfect and teach others so that all the brothers and sisters will be able to do the same. Fourth, prophesy. Paul said that you can all prophesy one by one (1 Cor. 14:31). He also said, &ldquo;If all prophesy&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:24). This shows that this matter is possible. Moreover, among the four steps, prophesying is the highest of all the functions.</p>
<p>Paul was a great apostle. He stayed in Ephesus for three years teaching from house to house, exhorting with tears night and day, and holding back nothing concerning the counsel of God (Acts 20:31, 27). Paul&rsquo;s work included nourishing, care, teaching, and perfecting. This is what Paul was doing, and this is also what we should be doing. He is the pattern to us believers. Paul was not just there giving a few messages to supply some life. Colossians 1:28-29 says, &ldquo;Whom we announce, warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man full-grown in Christ; for which also I labor, struggling according to His operation which operates in me in power.&rdquo; It is through this kind of laboring that every man can be presented full-grown in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING IN THE CHURCH MEETING</h2>
<p>After a person has received some care and perfecting, he will be able to prophesy in the district meetings. To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, to speak forth the Lord, and to speak the Lord into others so that they will be supplied. Your speaking must be filled with content. Also, your spirit must be strong. Only then will you be able to receive inspiration. In addition, you must be a person that has passed through dealings before the Lord and has a clear view. If you have all three things, you are qualified to prophesy. Not only do you have to learn, but you must also help others to see what is the proper prophesying that will build up the church.</p>
<p>The way of mutual teaching and mutual asking and answering in the small group meeting can also stir up the prophesying ability within you. The old way of Christianity has annulled the organic function of all the saints. But the new way of the Lord is a way of stirring up. In the past, we were influenced by tradition to think that every time we came to a meeting, we came to a worship service, where one man would be leading and teaching. Now our way is to have everyone speak. This will afford opportunity for everyone to be stirred up. After a period of time, it will become habitual for people to prophesy in the meetings. This is the way of the Bible. At present, every week, we take one chapter of Scripture. Every morning, we take a portion and pick out from the portion two verses for pray-reading. Then we write down the inspiration. By Saturday, we compile these inspirations into a composition for prophesying. This improves the content of prophesying. But we cannot be satisfied with this. We have to continue practicing until we can get rid of these helps. The elders and co-workers have to take the lead to exercise. Then they should bring the saints on and help them to develop the organic function within them.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the Christian meeting where the Word is released is the meeting of 1 Corinthians 14 in which every member prophesies. However, there are times when after an hour of meeting, the content of the prophesying is still quite weak and lifeless. At this time, you must not let the meeting go by. You have to grasp the opportunity to speak a five-minute word that is filled with rich content based on the material used. You may also give a conclusion. In this way, every time the attendants come, they will not go home empty-handed. The meetings will then have the rich prophesying, and the prophets will be produced. In the end, prophesying will become a tradition among us. I hope that one day, everywhere in the churches of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, prophesying will fill the atmosphere. After a new one attends our meetings for a few months, he will realize that our prophesying is not a matter of testimonies on getting rich and getting healed, but a speaking for the Lord and a speaking forth of the Lord. As a step further, he will even be able to prophesy in the meetings also.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BEING SLOTHFUL IN ZEAL,<br />
BUT BURNING IN SPIRIT TO SERVE THE LORD</h2>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the way is clearly set before us. First, there is the need for all the elders and co-workers to be diligent, to struggle and to strive, and to abound in the work of the Lord, knowing that our labor is not vain in the Lord. It will be remembered even in eternity. If we would labor on step by step, preaching the gospel, nourishing and caring for others, edifying and perfecting others, and stirring up others to prophesy, working effectively in all these four things, the reward will be everlasting. It is now up to us to labor. Paul exhorted the saints in Romans 12:11 to be &ldquo;not slothful in zeal, burning in spirit, serving the Lord as a slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Furthermore, the new way is definitely a workable way. If the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery would go on according to these four steps, that is, to live a life of preaching the gospel, nourishing, teaching, and prophesying, I firmly believe that in the end, the Lord will gain a full recovery. The truth is the truth. There is only one way which is organic. If you do not take this way to meet and to serve, there is no other way to take. Hence, everything is set here today. We should labor and have a realization within us that this way is of the Lord. He will surely gain a full recovery. May the Lord be merciful to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You. We offer You our deepest thanksgiving. Lord, we have to praise Your holy name. We thank You especially for giving us this day, that all the elders, co-workers, and trainees on this whole island can be gathered together. Lord, may You rend the heaven and come down upon us. Open up the heaven to us, and grant us a clear sky and a bright vision. Remove all the coverings and clouds. Lord, may we be open, heart to heart and spirit to spirit, to You and to one another. Lord, open the heaven, and open up Yourself. Remove for us all the powers of darkness and all the veils, that we would have no coverings whatsoever. Lord, may this place be joined to heaven, and may heaven be joined to earth.</p>
<p>Lord, speak to us and present to us clearly the way that You want to take and the recovery You want to accomplish in us. May this day be one as spoken of by Paul, where nothing is held back from us that concerns the counsel of God. Sanctify the two meetings in the morning and the afternoon. Lord, fill every meeting with Yourself. Move among us, that every one of us would feel in the depth of our being that this is Bethel, the place where heaven is joined to earth and God is revealed to man. Lord, this is the straight and proper path which we have consecrated ourselves to take, to turn to, to follow, and to walk in forever. It is the path of the righteous, which shines as the dawning of day until midday.</p>
<p>Lord, gain us. May You gain today what You have not gained during the past nineteen centuries. We would consecrate ourselves afresh, thoroughly, fully, corporately, unreservedly, and totally to You. In this last part of this century, may You accomplish what You have not accomplished. We are willing, ready, and in one accord for this. Lord, we are all here. We confess our smallness, weaknesses, shortcomings, and our many mistakes. We were born in mistakes. We are even mistake itself. But Lord, You are our salvation. We have You and possess You. Today we would give ourselves completely to You. You cooperate with us, and we are one spirit with You.</p>
<p>Lord, we ask again that You may complete what You have not completed in the last nineteen centuries. Whatever You have not recovered, whatever is left out, be it great or small, deep or high, may You recover it point by point among us. Not only may it be recovered today, but may it be recovered until You come, even until eternity, that You would gain what You are after.</p>
<p>Praise and thank You that Your desire was revealed to man over nineteen centuries ago. It has been written down clearly by Your servant, the Apostle Paul, and now every one of us can see, read, and understand. May You touch us, even touch the deepest part of our being, that no one among us would have any reservation, and that every one would be gained by You. Lord, glorify Your name. Shame Your enemy. Glorify Your people. Bless Your church and bless every saint, that all would be built up into a priesthood of the gospel. Amen!</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING GRADUAL AND PROGRESSIVE</h2>
<p>My burden today is to fellowship with you concerning our experience and the achievements which the Lord has given us during the past four and a half years.</p>
<p>We know that we began speaking of the new way here in Taipei in October 1984. From that time until now, it has been exactly four and a half years. When we first began to take this way, we said that this is a new way. We did not have any experience concerning this new way, and we were also lacking in a clear vision concerning it.</p>
<p>At the same time, we pointed out a series of matters related to how Christians should meet, preach the gospel, serve God, and work for God. From the time the Apostles passed away until today, Christians during the past nineteen centuries have been debating these four things. Because these four matters were very much related to the practical move and work of Christians, the debates became more and more heated. It even stirred up strife and hatred among brothers. Until today, the problems have not been resolved.</p>
<p>We know that as far as the Lord is concerned, everything in the universe was complete as soon as it was created. Nothing in the hands of the Lord needs advancement. But everything in the hands of man requires learning. This is because we cannot create. God requires no learning; hence, He requires no advancement. But human beings are different. Even to acquire fluency in a language requires a long period of time. From this we see that man is not a creator; rather, he advances through learning.</p>
<p>When we study church history, we find the same principle there. The word &ldquo;overcome&rdquo; was found in the epistles of the aged Apostle John before the Apostles passed away. To overcome is to be recovered. It means that something that was there originally was lost due to failure. There is the need to retrieve it. When the aged John wrote Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, he wrote seven epistles to the seven local churches. At the end of every epistle, he ended with the exhortation for overcomers (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). This is a recovery.</p>
<p>We see that before the end of the first century, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery began. Thereafter history shows us that, century by century, the recovery continued on. At times it was dim, but it was gradually becoming stronger and stronger. This went on until the 1500s, when Brother Martin Luther was raised up in Germany. He inherited the items of recovery from the past and culminated all the Lord&rsquo;s recoveries during the preceding sixteen centuries. But this does not mean that the recovery was completed; rather, it continued on. Not long afterward, the national church to which Luther belonged became a dead religion. This also became the general condition of Protestantism at that time. That is why the Lord told the church in Sardis, &ldquo;I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead...I have not found your works completed before My God&rdquo; (3:1-2). At that time, the whole of Protestantism was in a state of half completion and near death.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth century, the mystics, who emphasized the inner life, rose up from among the Catholics. In the eighteenth century, Brother Zinzendorf from the southern part of Germany began the recovery of the church life and the church practice. These were great advances and progressions in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. However, these were not enough. The Lord had to go on in His recovery. In the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up a group of brothers in England. They went further in the recovery of the church life; but in certain aspects they were still a failure. Because of this, the Lord could not go on at that time anywhere in the Western world.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the twentieth century, the Lord came to the Far East and raised up a young Chinese brother by the name of Watchman Nee. Initially, the help he received was inherited from the Brethren. But after ten years, he discovered that what he had received was not that complete. As a result, he had a turn, even many turns. For example, in 1938 he published the book <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> In 1948, when he was conducting a training on Mount Kuling in Foochow, he shared that at the time of the publishing of <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> he only saw the line of Antioch. But by 1948 he had gone on to see the line of Jerusalem. Hence, he turned from the line of Antioch, which was a &ldquo;rethinking,&rdquo; to the line of Jerusalem, which was a &ldquo;re-rethinking.&rdquo; From this example, we see that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is progressive. There have been many improvements.</p>
<p>Our God is a God who calls and there is. He does not need to change, neither does He need to improve. For us, however, this is not the case. When we were raised up to follow the Lord and to receive from the Lord, we received things step by step. Not only did Watchman Nee have a rethinking, even Brother Paul had rethinkings. In 1 Corinthians 7:8 he told the Corinthians, &ldquo;But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I.&rdquo; However, when he wrote 1 Timothy at an old age, he said, &ldquo;I will therefore that younger widows marry&rdquo; (5:14). The reason is that Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians represented his wish at the early stage of his ministry. In 1 Timothy he was advising the young widows according to his experience. This shows us that everyone has to learn; everyone has to rethink and has need of improvement.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FOUR VISIONS WE HAVE SEEN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Is an Organism<br />
Produced by the Processed Triune God</h2>
<p>In 1984, I went back to Taiwan to introduce the new way. The first three years there were spent testing and experimenting. One may say that we were researching in the laboratory. We spent a lot of time and effort investigating. During the last year or more, the Lord has opened to us vision after vision.</p>
<p>The first vision that the Lord has shown us is that the church is an organism produced by the processed Triune God. Fifty years ago we had the term organism. But the light then was not as clear. Now we see that the church is the Body of Christ. This organism is the outflow of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in His processes. This is the greatest light in the first chapter of Ephesians. It shows that the Body of Christ is an organism of God.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh.&rdquo; The Father was God who was in the beginning. One day He passed through a process to become the flesh. Originally, He was in eternity having nothing to do with creation. But one day, He was conceived in a creature&rsquo;s womb and after nine months was born as a man. However, this Son is both God and man. He is a God-man. This is not all. He lived a human life for thirty-three and a half years. In His childhood He experienced the life of an exile, escaping to Egypt with His parents. At the age of twelve, He went with His parents to Jerusalem to attend the feast. The wisdom of His words at the temple amazed the listeners (Luke 2:41-47). Gradually He grew up. From the age of twelve to thirty, He was a carpenter (Mark 6:3). This was not a comfortable process. It was not until He was thirty years of age that He came out to fulfill His ministry of preaching the gospel and saving sinners, which He did for three and a half years.</p>
<p>Eventually, He was crucified on the cross. From man&rsquo;s point of view, He was killed by man; but from God&rsquo;s point of view, He went voluntarily into death. He gave up His own body and soul-life. He said, &ldquo;No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again&rdquo; (John 10:18). He walked into death in great stride and descended into Hades, thus destroying death. Then He came out of death, entered into resurrection, and ascended from earth to heaven. More than ten disciples saw this ascension (Acts 1:9). On the day of Pentecost, He as the Spirit was poured out from heaven (Acts 2:1-4).</p>
<p>The Triune God went through all these processes. The end result of these processes is the Body of Christ. This is like a grain of wheat that falls into the ground and dies producing many grains. Eventually, the many grains become a loaf of bread. We all know that among all the things created by God in the universe, the most wonderful thing is our body. It is wonderful in that it is organic. For example, man sees with his eyes, hears with his ears, and speaks with his mouth. All these show that the body is organic. These are symbols of the Body of Christ. This Body is an organism of the Triune God. It does not come about by the Triune God through creation; neither does it come about by the Triune God calling it into being all of a sudden. It is produced by the Triune God through many processes.</p>
<p>There are twenty-three verses in the first chapter of Ephesians. Verses 3 through 6 speak of the Father&rsquo;s selection and predestination. Verses 7 through 12 speak of the Son&rsquo;s redemption and our becoming the predestinated inheritance in Him (v. 11). Verses 13 through 14 speak of the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing and pledging for our foretaste of the rich inheritance of God. The conclusion of chapter one says that the Son rose from among the dead, ascended into the heavenlies, transcended above all, had all things subjected under His feet, and became Head over all things to the church (1:20-22). The words &ldquo;to the church&rdquo; denote a kind of transmission. All that Christ the Head has attained and obtained are now transmitted to His Body, the church. Paul did not stop there. He continued in verse 23, &ldquo;[The church] which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.&rdquo; This verse is a footnote to chapter one, explaining how the processed Triune God produced a result which is the church. This church is the embodiment of the Triune God. It is also the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>We see that the church as an organism is the expression of the processed Triune God. Anything concerning the church must be in an organic sphere. Anything that is a deviation from this organism or an addition to it is not the church. The church is an organism as the mingling of God and man produced through the processed Triune God in His divine Trinity.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gifts Perfecting the Saints<br />
That the Latter May Do the Work<br />
of the New Testament Ministry Which Is<br />
the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4:11-16 reveals that the ascended Head gave many gifts in His ascension to the church. Some are apostles, some are prophets, some are evangelists, and some are shepherds and teachers. All these are for the perfecting of the saints.</p>
<p>We know that there is a very famous evangelist in America. For forty years he has been doing the work of mass evangelism, but he never perfects anyone. Although his work is great, there is no one to succeed him. If during these forty years, he would have perfected others to do the work of evangelism, then many would have been perfected. Man is unwilling to do this because man only sees what is close to him. He does not have a long-term view. He considers the big gospel campaigns more convenient than the training and perfecting of people. Furthermore, in the end, trainings do not necessarily perfect very many people. Hence, everyone takes the convenient and avoids the difficult, choosing the benefits of the readily accessible while neglecting the long-term view. As a result, year after year the necessary perfecting has been lacking. This is contrary to God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, we can see the example of the Lord Jesus perfecting others. He only functioned for three years in His ministry. At the beginning, He continually trained Peter, James, and John, bringing them to the high mountain, transfiguring Himself before their eyes, and revealing Himself to them. Later these three went on to perfect others, and eventually there were twelve disciples following the Lord. After the Lord went to the cross, He continued to train the disciples by His death and resurrection and by His invisible presence. Eventually, He gained one hundred twenty. This was how the Lord perfected people.</p>
<p>Concerning the Apostle Paul, he told us in Acts 20 that after he preached the gospel in Ephesus, he remained there for three years, teaching each one with tears night and day from house to house (vv. 20, 31). Colossians 1:28 also shows us that Paul warned and taught every man in all wisdom, so as to present every man full-grown in Christ. Although Paul was such a great apostle, he had to go from house to house to perfect the saints one by one, that they would all be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry in building up the Body of Christ. This is the second vision that we saw.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need for the Saints<br />
to Pursue and to Desire Prophesying<br />
That the Church May Be Built</h2>
<p>The Lord went on to show us that 1 Corinthians 14 is a chapter on prophesying. The prophesying mentioned in this chapter is universal. It is not restricted to a few people. Verse 31 says, &ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; When the whole church gathers together and all prophesy, those unbelievers who enter will be convicted by all, judged by all, and will say that God is really among you (vv. 24-25). This is the culmination in 1 Corinthians 14 of everything concerning meeting, gospel preaching, working for the Lord, and service to God.</p>
<p>We cannot be hasty in teaching the brothers and sisters how to prophesy. You cannot teach a kindergartner to write essays. First he must go to primary school and practice writing. Furthermore, he must learn to compose sentences. Only after he has learned to compose sentence after sentence will he be able to write essays. After we gain the new ones, we must first have home meetings to nourish and cherish them. After they have grown up, then we should bring them to the small group meetings. In the small group meetings, there is the mutual teaching and learning of the truth and the pursuit of the growth in life. Whenever anyone speaks the word of God, based on the experience of life and the knowledge of the truth, the result is prophesying.</p><h2 class="head2">Recovering the New Testament Priesthood<br />
of the Gospel</h2>
<p>A priest of the New Testament is a priest of the gospel. The Old Testament priests were priests of bulls and goats. They specialized in the offering of bulls and goats as sacrifices. The turn of the priesthood from the Old Testament to the New Testament happened in John the Baptist who was born a priest. He was the only son of his father who was a priest. According to the custom, he should have worn the priestly garment, eaten the priestly food, and grown up in the temple. But he went to live in the wilderness, wearing camel&rsquo;s hair, and eating locusts and wild honey (Matt. 3:4). He exhorted men to repent. If any men repented, he would bury them in the River Jordan (Matt. 3:1, 6). Everything about him was wild, including his food, his clothing, his dwelling, his preaching, and his work. Notwithstanding, he was the first one to turn from the Old Testament priesthood to the New Testament priesthood. From that time on, it was no longer a matter of offering up bulls and goats for sacrifices. Rather, it has become a matter of offering up saved sinners in Christ as sacrifices. John the Baptist was the first priest of the gospel in the New Testament. All New Testament believers should be like him, going out to preach the gospel that calls for repentance, baptizing the believing ones, and offering them up in Christ to God.</p>
<p>First Peter says, &ldquo;You yourselves also...being built up...into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God&rdquo; (2:5). Romans also says that one &ldquo;should be a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (15:16). The fact mentioned in Romans 15:16 confirms the vision seen by Peter in 1 Peter 2. Paul became a spiritual priest, a gospel priest, offering up to God spiritual sacrifices, which are the sinners saved through his preaching. Hence, every New Testament believer should be a priest, offering up the saved sinners as sacrifices. If a New Testament believer has not preached the gospel and does not lead sinners to be saved, he is a priest who fails in his function.</p>
<p>According to our natural concept, we think that inviting our friends, ushering, counseling, record taking, and similar activities during gospel campaigns in the past were our services and were functions of the priests. Actually, these are just works of the Levites. They were not works of the priests. Although many famous preachers can conduct gospel campaigns and save sinners, their way is contrary to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and kills the spiritual function of the believers as priests of the gospel. We see from the New Testament that the Lord continually perfected others and sent them out. First, the twelve were sent out, and then the seventy were sent out. Furthermore, they were sent &ldquo;into every city and place where He Himself was about to come&rdquo; (Luke 10:1). I believe that their going out was surely not for the Levitical work but for the preaching of the gospel, the saving of the sinners, and the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have to see that the gospel meeting in Christianity today with one or two preaching, though right in goal, is wrong in means. The reason for this is that it has changed the nature of the universal gospel priesthood of the believers to that of the exclusive gospel priesthood of the few. All the believers wait until the gospel giant comes and then participate in Levitical services. After the gospel campaigns, no one preaches the gospel anymore. This is not the way to preach the gospel in the New Testament. The New Testament reveals that every saved person is a priest preaching the gospel. Hence, we conclude that there are indeed many ways to preach the gospel and that all these ways do save people. But this does not mean that every way will make each believer a New Testament priest of the gospel. This is the light and revelation we have received recently from the Lord.</p>
<p>If this had been the way we led the church forty years ago, and if we had established this tradition among us, the ones saved through us would have become priests of the gospel long ago. Soon after they were saved, they would have preached the gospel to lead sinners to be saved. The revelation is open to us today in order to show us that the preaching of the gospel should arrive at God&rsquo;s goal and complete God&rsquo;s economy. The economy of God today is for every saint to be a priest of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PERFECTING OTHERS FOR THE VISION</h2>
<p>Since last summer, the Lord has shown us four great visions in succession. First, the church is the Body of Christ, which is an organism that issued from the processed Triune God. It comes into being neither accidentally, nor by His creation. Second, the emphasis in the service of all the gifts is not on the works, but on their perfecting of the saints to do the works. We must perfect the saints to be able to do whatever we are able to do. Third, there is the need to help everyone to grow so that all can prophesy for the Lord. Today the Lord does not speak through one or two persons in the church. Rather He speaks through everyone. Only when every member prophesies will the church be built. Fourth, gospel preaching must be done by everyone personally through visiting others in their homes. It should not be done by calling big gospel campaigns. If there are only gospel campaigns, believers will be degraded to serve only as Levites, and only a few will then be able to serve as the exclusive priests of the gospel. The spiritual function of all the believers as priests of the gospel will be killed. These four visions are what I want to fellowship and communicate to all of you elders and co-workers at this time.</p>
<p>I came back here this time to do the work of perfecting. I am here to perfect you to do what I am doing. This is like the parents in a family teaching the children with the hope that they will grow up properly. This is what Paul meant when he said to the Thessalonians that he was like a nursing mother cherishing them (1 Thes. 2:7) and a father entreating them (v. 11). The result of his perfecting was to present the believers full-grown. This morning I lay this outline before you with the hope that you would take it home and fellowship much about it. You can have all the elders come together with the seeking brothers and sisters to get into these points. These are all crucial points concerning how we should meet and serve in the coming days.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>

	</ol></li>
</ol><h2 class="head1">REALIZING GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE, PLAN, AND ECONOMY</h2>
<p>God has a desire in Himself. In contrast to this, Satan also has an evil intent which is to damage. God has a plan, and Satan in contrast has a deception which is to frustrate. God has an economy, and Satan in contrast has a work which is to confuse. Hence, on the one hand, we have to realize God&rsquo;s desire, plan, and economy. On the other hand, we have to expose Satan&rsquo;s evil intent, deception, and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Desire</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire is to work Himself into man to be life and everything to man. First John 4:15 and Philippians 2:13 both strongly confirm this fact. Since the time of Brother Nee we have been talking about this matter. When I began working in America, my speaking became even stronger. There are over one hundred messages already in print concerning this matter. Until today, when Christianity preaches the gospel, there is still very little mention of this matter. Mostly it tells people that man is sinful, that God is righteous, and that the Lord Jesus has died on our behalf according to the righteousness of God. When one believes in Him, his sins will be forgiven, and he will be justified by God. As to life, Christianity touches only briefly the matter of regeneration.</p>
<p>Regeneration is God&rsquo;s coming into us to be our life. Hence, regeneration is to have the life of God in addition to the life which man has in himself. It means to be born again. First, God regenerates us in our spirit. Then He expands from our spirit to our mind, occupying and saturating all the parts of our mind. This is transformation. We will then be a mature person in the eyes of God, waiting for the Lord to come back, at which time our body will be fully saturated as well. That will be the redemption of the body. Hence, first there is the regeneration in our spirit, then the transformation in our soul, and finally, at the coming of the Lord, the redemption of our body. In this way our whole being will enter into glory, that is, into all that the Triune God is. The above words are the light and revelation which we have accumulated through our sixty years of studying the Bible and the spiritual books.</p>
<p>In addition to God being our life, He wants to be our everything. Life is not a simple thing. Life requires wisdom, power, and light. Life also requires virtues like patience, forbearance, and forgiveness. These virtues are created by God and manifested in humanity. The human virtues created by God are merely shells. They are like gloves. The gloves are different from the hands. The inward reality of these virtues is the divine attributes of God. When the divine attributes get into us to become the content of our human virtues, together they become the good works described in the Bible and sought after by God. The good works that God is after are the ones that are lived out from our human virtues when God gets into us, the created men, to be the content of our goodness. The Bible calls these works virtues (2 Pet. 1:3). Hence, virtue is not just a kind of meritorious behavior, but a kind of spiritual power.</p>
<p>When the Triune God works Himself into us to be our life and everything, we meet and fellowship by this life. Without this life there is no Christian meeting and no fellowship. Fellowship is the flow of the divine life. Today some have translated the word <em>fellowship</em> as communication. Communication gives a somewhat worldly connotation. First John chapter 1 clearly shows us that the divine fellowship issues from the divine life. When an unsaved person comes to our meetings, he can imitate our singing and prayer. But he is absolutely outside of our fellowship. This is because he is not the same as we are. He does not have the divine life. When Christianity was first introduced to China, the term &ldquo;giao-you&rdquo; (meaning, nominal church member) was a popular expression. After we were raised up by the Lord, we opposed the use of terms such as this. &ldquo;Giao-you&rdquo; is a worldly expression. We are not &ldquo;giao-you&rdquo;; we are brothers, having the same life. Because we are brothers sharing the same life, we are able to have fellowship one with another. Today, the basis of our meeting, gospel preaching, service, and work for the Lord is regeneration, by which we have the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Plan</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s plan is for the men who have His life and who are joined to Him organically to be the organic members of Christ the embodiment of the Triune God. There are two strong phrases here: to have His life and to be joined to Him organically. Because we have God as our life, we can be joined to Him organically. A broken staff can be glued together. It can even be surrounded by a metal ring, or even wrapped with gold. But there is no organic joining together. The reason for this is that there is no life. But the grafting of trees is different. When a living branch is grafted onto a tree, very soon the two will grow into one. This is to be joined organically. In the same way, a broken arm can be joined together again through the circulation of blood, which is the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>There is an organic union between God and us. God grows into us, and we grow into God. God&rsquo;s plan is to make this kind of people the organic members of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. God desires to make us who have His life and who are joined to Him organically the members of Christ. Christ is the embodiment of God. Hence, we become the organic members of Christ, the embodiment of God. These members are constituted the church, the organism of this Triune God (Eph. 1:23). This is a matter of constitution, and it is by life. The church is not an organization that has no life. Those who have His life and who are joined to Him organically are not just the members of Christ; they are also constituted the church as the organism of the Triune God. Even more, they are the Body of Christ as God&rsquo;s fullness in Christ to express Him (Eph. 1:23; 3:19b).</p><h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s economy is His arrangement. The word <em>economy</em> is an appropriate translation (1 Tim. 1:4b). Its original meaning is a house law, meaning a household management and administration, and it has the derived meaning of an arrangement or economy in administration. God has an administrative arrangement. He arranges to have every one of the members of Christ to be God&rsquo;s priest of the gospel (Rom. 15:16). Hence, no matter how much you feel you are unable to preach the gospel, God has made such an arrangement. Actually, as long as you are a regenerated person, having God&rsquo;s life within, your ability to preach the gospel is there by birth, just as a person&rsquo;s speaking ability is there by birth.</p>
<p>God desires that we preach the gospel to save sinners, offering them up as sacrifices. Paul said in Romans 15:16 that he was &ldquo;a minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Verses 5 and 9 of 1 Peter 2 also say that we are built up &ldquo;into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ....But you are...a royal priesthood...so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.&rdquo; These few passages show us that we are a holy priesthood and that each one of us is a priest of the gospel for the telling out of the virtues of God&rsquo;s salvation and for the offering up of the nations as acceptable sacrifices to God. God&rsquo;s virtues are the gospel that we preach. Hence, every one of us has to preach the gospel and lead the sinners to salvation, bringing them to God and offering them up as sacrifices. But this does not mean that you should go out to invite people to come listen to one man speaking. That is to be a Levite; it is not to be a priest. Today, we have to reconsider the service of the brothers and sisters. Formerly, we encouraged everyone to come arrange the chairs, clean the floor, mow the lawn, and trim the trees, thinking that by so doing, the whole church would be in service. But why did we not use that time to have everyone go and preach the gospel? For this, I take the lead to confess to you my mistake.</p>
<p>After a person has received the gospel and been saved and baptized, he is like a newborn child. What follows is his need to be nourished and cared for so that he will grow in the spiritual life to the point that he can offer himself up to God as a living sacrifice (John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Pet. 2:2; Rom. 12:1). This is the second step. However, it is not enough for a child just to be nourished and cared for; there is still the need of teaching and perfecting. The same is true with the spiritual life. Hence, there is a third step, which is to teach and to perfect the saints for the work of the New Testament ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). In the end, these perfected saints are to be the prophets, speaking for the Lord and supplying Christ to build up the church, completing God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and fulfilling God&rsquo;s eternal plan for the satisfaction of God&rsquo;s desire in eternity (1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5). This is the revelation of the Bible.</p>
<p>However, our actual situation is not like this today. We have managed our meeting hall well; but our gospel preaching, home meetings, small group meetings, and prophesying are not doing as well. This is because we are accustomed to cleaning the meeting hall, but we are not accustomed to preaching the gospel and nourishing people. We even consider that we cannot do the job ourselves. This is a mistake in our leading in the past. What we have said above is what God has shown us during the past four and a half years as the proper way for saints to meet and serve according to His ordination and the biblical revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPOSING SATAN&rsquo;S EVIL INTENT,<br />
DECEPTION, AND CONFUSION</h2>
<p>Today there are two trees before us. One is the tree of life, and the other is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. One is genuine; the other is a counterfeit. In the market there are often counterfeit goods. Satan is the top counterfeiter. For this reason, we have to expose his evil intent, deception, and confusion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Satan&rsquo;s Evil Intent</h2>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s evil intent is to frustrate God&rsquo;s desire of working Himself into man to be man&rsquo;s life and everything. The New Testament shows us clearly that God lives in us and that we live in God (1 John 4:15). We know that He lives in us and that we live in Him by the life which He gave us. However, many people do not emphasize this point in their preaching of the gospel. This is the frustration of Satan&rsquo;s evil intent. For this reason, we have compiled a booklet for the preaching of the gospel called <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> We did this because the center of our gospel preaching is God working Himself into man to be his life and everything.</p><h2 class="head2">Satan&rsquo;s Deception</h2>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s deception is to kill the organic function of the members of Christ through religious service, to replace the church as the organism of the Triune God through religious organization, and to counterfeit the Body of Christ as the fullness and expression of the Triune God through religious association. The service in Christianity today is almost entirely religious. When a person becomes a member, all he needs to do is to listen to sermons and give money. Eventually, his organic function as a member of Christ is annulled. Moreover, the religious organization has replaced the church as the organism of the Triune God, and the religious association has become a counterfeit to the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Satan&rsquo;s Confusion</h2>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s confusion comes, first, by his using a few specially gifted ones to preach the gospel, thereby despising the function of every believer as a component of God&rsquo;s priesthood of the gospel. When man exalts the gospel preaching of the gospel giants, the function of thousands of believers as God&rsquo;s priesthood of the gospel is despised. Today, many believers cannot preach the gospel. This is true even among us. They can zealously invite people to come to gospel meetings, but after the message, they still have to find some gifted ones to talk to their friends. This is the result of honoring the few gifted ones while despising the corporate priesthood. The New Testament priests that God is after are a priesthood and a corporate entity. The word <em>priesthood</em> is difficult to translate into Chinese. This is why the Chinese Union Version translated it only as &ldquo;priest&rdquo; without the &ldquo;hood&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). But this is to miss a great truth. Our own Chinese translation, however, has taken great pains to bring out this distinction. The New Testament priests do not exist as individuals. Rather, they function as a priesthood. Therefore, there will surely be a despising of the priesthood of the gospel whenever the gift of gospel preaching of single individuals is too highly honored.</p>
<p>Second, Satan&rsquo;s confusion comes when he uses a few clergy to shepherd and care for new believers, thereby denying the spiritual organic function of every believer in nourishing and caring for one another. God&rsquo;s economy is for every believer to nourish and care for the new believers and for one another (1 Cor. 12:25). However, Satan&rsquo;s confusion is to have a few clergy to shepherd and care for the new ones. &ldquo;Shepherds&rdquo; in Ephesians 4:11 has been translated by some as &ldquo;pastors.&rdquo; Man&rsquo;s concept today is that a doctor is needed for illness, a lawyer is needed for a lawsuit, and a pastor is needed for help in prayer and supplication. Many Christians cannot even pray. They ask a pastor to come and pray for them. But the Bible shows us that many brothers and sisters, even all of us, are shepherds. Hence, the way of using a few clergy to shepherd and care for the new believers is a denial of the spiritual organic function of every believer in nourishing and caring for one another.</p>
<p>Third, Satan&rsquo;s confusion comes when professional teachers are used to teach and edify the saints, thereby replacing the work of each saint being perfected to perfect others unto the work of the New Testament ministry of the building up of the Body of Christ. God&rsquo;s economy is for the gifted ones to perfect the saints that the latter would all participate in the work of the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-16). But the practice in Christianity is to employ the professional teachers to teach and edify the saints. In this way, the work of each saint being perfected to perfect others unto the work of the building up of the Body of Christ is replaced.</p>
<p>Fourth, Satan&rsquo;s confusion comes when prophesying and speaking for the Lord are regarded as the exclusive gift of a few people, and the fact that every believer can and should be a prophet speaking for the Lord is not recognized. This was also the case among us in the past. As a result, we suffered greatly during the past forty years. If we had taken the proper view and way forty years ago when we began our work here, I believe most of the brothers and sisters would be able to prophesy by now.</p>
<p>Using a few specially gifted ones for the preaching of the gospel, using a few clergy to shepherd and care for new believers, using professional teachers to teach and edify the saints, and regarding prophesying and the speaking for the Lord as the exclusive gift of a few people are the confusion of Satan. They make everyone unclear. Now we have to expose Satan&rsquo;s confusion and rise up together to attack Satan, the evil one. The above describes the crooked way that Satan has used throughout the ages to damage and confuse the God-ordained, proper way for saints to meet and to serve God. It is not an evil way. But it is a crooked way. It makes us crooked. Hence, we have to expose it.</p></body></html>
