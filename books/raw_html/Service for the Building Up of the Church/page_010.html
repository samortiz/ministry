        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
NEEDING THE MANIFESTED FUNCTION<br />
OF EVERY MEMBER</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:15-16; Col. 2:19</h1>
<p>In the previous chapters we emphasized that in order for the church to be built up, we must know the authority of the Head, and we must know God&rsquo;s heart. One is a matter of authority, and the other is a matter of love. Authority eliminates problems, and love brings in the riches. In a normal and strong church, all the serving ones manifest these two aspects. On the one hand, they know the throne and authority; therefore, problems, conflicts, and unnecessary situations are spontaneously eliminated. On the other hand, they touch God&rsquo;s heart and have the same love toward all the saints. Hence, their service is solid and full of the element of building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on the building up of the church being not only a matter of authority and love but also of the manifested function of the members. Both Ephesians 4:15-16 and Colossians 2:19 show that in order for the Body, the church, to be built up, the function of the members must be manifested. The church is not built by external influences but by the Body itself. In order for the Body to be built, each one part must function according to the operation of its measure.</p>
<p>Some believers think that the building up of the church is the responsibility of the full-time workers. This is an inaccurate concept. Ephesians 4 shows that the church is not built up directly by the four kinds of gifts. Rather, these gifts perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry so that all the saints may manifest their function (vv. 11-12). It is through the manifested function of every saint that the church is built up. If we read chapter 4 carefully, we will see that these gifts&mdash;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers&mdash;build up the church only indirectly, not directly.</p>
<p>Bible translators have different views about verses 11 and 12. According to the Greek text, however, these two verses say, &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.&rdquo; This shows that the gifts perfect the saints so that the saints can participate in the building up of the Body of Christ. Without being perfected by the gifts, the saints will not be able to fulfill their responsibilities, but after being perfected by the gifts, the saints should manifest their function, which results in the building up of the Body of Christ. From this we see that the gifts do not build up the church directly; their work in building up the church is indirect.</p>
<p>Although some understand that the perfecting of the saints is the responsibility of the gifts, they mistakenly include the work of the ministry and the building up of the Body of Christ as part of this same responsibility; that is, they believe that all of these three aspects of building up are done by the gifts directly. However, this understanding is not supported by the context of the chapter. Although verse 12 speaks of the building up of the Body as it relates to the gifts, verse 16 explicitly associates the building up of the Body in love with the operation in the measure of each one part. If we read only verse 12, we may think that only the gifts can build up the Body. However, verses 15 and 16 clearly show that the building up of the Body is an issue of the functioning of each one part. The building up of the Body is carried out by the gifts indirectly and by all the saints directly.</p>
<p>We need to consider this more deeply, because it is not merely a matter of translation or exposition but of practice. The general understanding in Christianity is that the building up of the church is the responsibility of the clergy, meaning that the church is built by pastors and preachers. Consequently, the saints are not considered as builders but as those who need to be built up. Thus, they have no responsibility for the building up. This understanding, however, is incompatible with the New Testament, which states that every believer is responsible for building up the church. The building up of the church is not the responsibility of a special minority of believers.</p>
<p>We must be very clear that the building up of the church is the responsibility of all the saints; the church cannot be built up merely through the efforts of a few members. If the local brothers and sisters expect a group of workers to build up the church and do not endeavor to build up the church themselves, the building up of the church will be frustrated. According to the light in Ephesians 4, the gifts merely perfect the saints, who are then directly responsible for the building up of the church.</p>
<p>The physical growth of a person follows this same principle. An infant may be only twelve inches long when he is born, but when he is an adult, he may be five or six feet tall. His growth and increase in stature, however, are not the issue of external influences; rather, his growth is the result of the operation in the measure of each one part of his body. Parents often consult a doctor when they see that their child is not growing, but the doctor cannot cause the child to grow. The most that a doctor can do is to help the parts of the child&rsquo;s body to function properly so that it is possible for the child to grow. For example, if the child has a problem with his stomach, the doctor can help his stomach function properly. If the child has a problem with his ears or nose, the doctor can treat his ears or nose so that the child&rsquo;s growth will not be hindered. Sometimes a child may not have any obvious problems, but he still does not grow. Then the doctor may prescribe some multivitamins to strengthen the functioning of the various organs of the child. This further shows that the doctor is not directly responsible for the physical growth of the child. At the most, a doctor can help to perfect the physical parts of the child&rsquo;s body. When each part of the body is properly functioning according to its measure, the properly functioning parts will be directly responsible for the growth of the child.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the Body of Christ the gifts are not directly responsible for the growth of the Body. This responsibility belongs to all the saints. The responsibility to perfect the saints belongs to the gifts. For example, a brother may be an &ldquo;ear&rdquo; in the Body of Christ; if he has a problem, he can be perfected by a gift who functions as a &ldquo;spiritual ear doctor.&rdquo; When this member is &ldquo;healed,&rdquo; that is, perfected, the growth of the Body will no longer be hindered. Other brothers and sisters may lack spiritual food and spiritual vitamins, but a minister of the word can supply them with the word of God as food. As a result, the brothers and sisters will receive spiritual nutrients and become strong to function. This shows that the gifts do not build up the church directly. The building up of the Body of Christ depends on the operation in the measure of each one part of the Body, which brings out the function that is needed for growth. We should never expect a group of workers to build up the church in our locality; the workers can only perfect the saints. The church is built directly by the saints in the church, the members in the Body.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
