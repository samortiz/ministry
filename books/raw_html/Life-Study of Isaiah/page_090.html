<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Being Their Arm and Salvation</H2><P>In 33:2 Isaiah says, "O Jehovah, be gracious to us; we have waited for You;/Be our arm every morning,/Our salvation also in the time of distress." In the morning revival we need to enjoy Christ as our arm and our salvation. We also need to enjoy Him in this way during times of distress.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah Being Exalted</H2><P>According to 33:5, Jehovah is exalted, for He dwells on high; He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness. Verse 6 continues, "And there will be stability for your times: / A wealth of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge;/The fear of Jehovah is his treasure." Stability is similar to assurance. Here the word times refers to one's entire life. In the restoration, the life of God's people will be filled with stability.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Jehovah' Eyes Seeing<br>Jerusalem, a Secure Habitation</H2><P>"Look upon Zion, the city of our appointed feasts;/Your eyes will see Jerusalem,/A secure habitation, a tent that will not be removed;/Its stakes will never be pulled up,/And none of its cords will be torn apart" (33:20). There the Majestic, Jehovah, will be for Israel a place of rivers and broad streams, for He is their Judge, their Lawmaker, and their King. He will save them (v. 21a, 22). The inhabitant will not say, "I am sick," and the people who dwell there will be forgiven their iniquity (v. 24).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. The Wilderness and the Desert<br>Being Glad, and the Desert Rejoicing<br>and Blossoming Like the Rose</H2><P>In chapter thirty-five we have a marvelous picture of restoration. The wilderness and the desert will be glad; and the desert will blossom like the rose. It will blossom and blossom and even rejoice with joy and a ringing shout. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, the splendor of Carmel and Sharon; they will see the glory of Jehovah, the splendor of their God. (vv. 1-2). Then the eyes of the blind will be opened, and the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. The lame will leap like a hart, and the tongue of the dumb will give a ringing shout. For water will break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert. The desert mirage will become a pool, and the thirsty ground, springs of water. In the habitation of jackals, their resting place, there will be grass with reeds and rushes. The place that was once so unpleasant will become the resting place of the restored people. A highway will be there, and a way, and it will be called "The Way of Holiness." The unclean will not pass on it, but it will be for him who walks on the way; no fools will wander (or err) in it. There will be no lion there, nor will any ravenous animal go up on it. They will not be found there, but the redeemed will walk on it. The ransomed of Jehovah will return and will come to Zion with a ringing shout, and eternal joy will be upon their heads. They will lay hold on gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing will flee away (vv. 5-10).</P>
