<h2 class="head2">63. The Stone Falling on the Gentile Kingdoms<br />
and Scattering Them as Chaff</h2>
<p>Christ will also be the stone falling on the Gentile kingdoms and scattering them as chaff. This is prophesied in Daniel 2:34-35, 44-45. Verses 34 and 35 say, &ldquo;Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and brake them to pieces. Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; These verses indicate that when Christ comes the second time, He will be a stone cut without hands falling from the heavens upon the great image. The great image signifies the worldly powers from Babylon down to the ten kingdoms of the restored Roman Empire, which will exist at the time of Christ&rsquo;s coming back. Christ will be the smiting stone that will scatter all the broken nations as chaff. Then He will become a great mountain&mdash;the kingdom of God on earth.</p>
<p>In Matthew 21:44 the Lord, referring to the stone in Daniel 2, says that &ldquo;on whomever it falls, it shall scatter him as chaff.&rdquo; Those on whom the stone falls will be the nations which Christ will smite at His coming back. To the believers, Christ is the foundation stone, the building stone, in whom they trust (Isa. 28:16); to the unbelieving Jews, He is the stumbling stone (Isa. 8:14; Rom. 9:33); and to the nations, He will be the smiting stone. We, the believers, experience Christ as the building stone. But the Jews who reject Him and are stumbled by Him will experience Him as the stumbling stone and be broken to pieces. Eventually, the unbelieving Gentiles who fight against God will know Christ as the smiting stone, for He will smite them and scatter them like chaff driven by the wind.</p>
<h2 class="head2">64. The Coming King<br />
Setting Up His Kingdom over All the Earth</h2>
<p>Zechariah 14:9 says, &ldquo;The Lord shall be King over all the earth.&rdquo; This prophecy concerning Christ as the coming King setting up His kingdom over all the earth is fulfilled in Matthew 25:31-34 and 1 Corinthians 15:25. When the Lord comes back, He will save Israel and will smite the Gentile nations and judge them. Then He will set up His kingdom on earth for a thousand years, for the millennium. In the millennium there will be three realms: the realm of the earth, where the blessing of God&rsquo;s creation, as mentioned in Genesis 1:28-30, will take place; the realm of the nation of Israel, from Canaan, from the Nile to the Euphrates, in which the saved Jews will rule over the whole earth (Isa. 60:10-12; Zech. 14:16-18); and the heavenly and spiritual realm (1 Cor. 15:50-52), which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, where the overcoming believers will enjoy the kingdom reward (Matt. 5:20; 7:21).</p>
<p>Speaking of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom, 1 Corinthians 15:25 says, &ldquo;He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.&rdquo; This will be the Lord&rsquo;s reign in the millennium, the last age of the old creation. The longer Christ reigns, the more enemies are put under His feet. Eventually, at the end of the millennium every enemy will have been put under the feet of Christ. The word &ldquo;until&rdquo; in 1 Corinthians 15:25 indicates this and points to the end of the thousand years. That will be the time when every enemy has been put under Christ&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<h2 class="head2">65. A Servant of the Circumcision<br />
for the Truthfulness of God</h2>
<p>Romans 15:8 says, &ldquo;I say that Christ has become a servant of the circumcision for the truthfulness of God, to confirm the promises given to the fathers.&rdquo; The expression &ldquo;the circumcision&rdquo; refers to the Jews, God&rsquo;s covenanted people. &ldquo;Truthfulness&rdquo; denotes genuineness, sincerity, honesty, trustworthiness, and faithfulness as a divine virtue. Romans 15:8 indicates that Christ served the Jews by fulfilling God&rsquo;s promises to their forefathers, and this He did for the truthfulness of God. In order to prove that God is truthful and for the sake of maintaining God&rsquo;s truthfulness, Christ was a Servant to the Jewish people, the circumcision, to fulfill the promises made by God to their forefathers.</p>
<p>We have considered Christ&rsquo;s person in the fulfillment of the Old Testament prophecies. These prophecies are concerned with Christ from eternity past until the time of the kingdom. The fact that these prophecies are fulfilled in the New Testament is a strong proof that whatever the New Testament reveals is fully of God. Only God can write such a book.</p>
