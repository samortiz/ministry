   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SETTING UP MEETINGS IN THE HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO TEACH THE PURE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Following this, set up a meeting in their home to teach them the pure truth by first using the New Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These lessons teach them how to start their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then following these we must use the Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Truth Lessons were written in a way to teach the believers the truth in a very good sequence and line.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we have the first three volumes in English.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you only give the new ones a sheet of paper with points of the truth on it, they may not respect it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After using it, it might be put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, if you would recommend these books, telling them that this series will be in four levels for four years and that each level has four volumes, they will be impressed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they see a set of books like this, they will respect them, keep them, and treasure them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You do not need to teach them lesson by lesson as we have done in the past one or two years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Use the line of growing in life in volume three that speaks concerning the real condition of a sinner, Christ's redemption, forgiveness, regeneration, and justification, all in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You do not need to use the entire lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Circle or mark out certain paragraphs and teach them these certain paragraphs in about twenty minutes or at the most thirty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Give them an assignment, telling them that they have to read the rest of the paragraphs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to get yourself familiar with all the truth lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then you can tell them that this set of Truth Lessons is in a good order.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If they want to know where the Bible came from, there is a truth lesson to tell them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This will not be a lesson book to them, but their reading material.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is written in such a way that everybody can read it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They may not understand certain phrases, or terminology temporarily, but gradually they will pick them up.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If they have a question about who Jesus Christ is, show them a lesson telling them who Jesus Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ask them to read that lesson with much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then they will get the full knowledge of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If they want to know what the church is, show them a lesson on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, give them a little portion for your teaching, but assign them to read the rest of the paragraphs of a certain lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They also need a complete Bible including the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I still like to recommend the American Standard Version.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although it is an old translation, it is still quite good.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Also encourage them to get a copy of the Recovery Version of the New Testament because they can read all the notes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After this, recommend to them our publications, such as the rainbow booklets, the Life-study Messages, and the many other small books.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Encourage them to get these publications gradually and lead them to grow into the habit of reading the Bible and the spiritual books.</S>
