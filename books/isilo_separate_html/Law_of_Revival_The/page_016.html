in Order to Know Resurrection</h2>
<p>We must experience death in order to know the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Paul was spiritual, but he also needed to experience many sufferings, including prison. To be in prison signifies the bondage and restriction that make it impossible for us to be as free as we were previously. Formerly, we had &ldquo;wings&rdquo; and could fly wherever we wanted without any restrictions. Now, however, the Lord has put us in a prison under restriction. To be in prison has broad implications. We are in prison when we are down or when our spirit cannot rise. These experiences are necessary, for it is while we are in prison that we experience the Lord&rsquo;s death and the power of His resurrection. The suffering in prison is not merely outward persecution or difficulties; it is a spiritual killing that will put to death the natural elements in us so that we may be delivered from the self and conformed to His death. The Lord&rsquo;s death is a mold that puts to death all that belongs to us and resurrects all that belongs to Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord places us in the prison of trials, He gives us a vision of Himself as a gazelle and a young hart. We may be imprisoned behind walls, but He is not obstructed by mountains or hills, because He leaps on the mountains and skips on the hills. When He shows us this vision, He calls us to rise up and come away with Him because the winter is past and the rain is over (v. 11). This means that death is gone. According to our feeling, we are still in death, but He says, &ldquo;All the things of death are over and gone, so you must rise up and come away with Me.&rdquo; This is resurrection. Hence, when Paul wrote the book of Philippians in prison, he repeatedly said that he rejoiced, and he exhorted the believers to rejoice in the Lord also (2:17-18; 4:4). Paul was transcendent. He was not bound by the environment on the earth, because he knew resurrection, and he knew how to apply resurrection power to his suffering of imprisonment. The suffering of imprisonment, on the one hand, caused Paul&rsquo;s natural elements to be put to death and, on the other hand, caused all the elements of God to be lived out from within Paul. This is to be conformed to Christ&rsquo;s death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Conformed to Christ&rsquo;s Death</h2>
<p>In order to make a cake, the dough must be pressed into a mold. Then the dough will have the same form as the mold. The death of the Lord Jesus is a mold, and our person and our living are the dough. God places us in all kinds of environments to &ldquo;mold&rdquo; us until we are conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death. To be in the form of the Lord&rsquo;s death means that everything of man, including that which is bad and also that which is good, has to die. When the Lord Jesus became a man, He put on the God-created humanity. His humanity was not bad. Nevertheless, it needed to be put to death. Through His death the things of man were crucified, and the things of God were brought forth. Hence, some things will be terminated through death, but other things will come out of death. The mold of the death of the Lord Jesus has these two aspects.</p>
<p>Our experience of the Lord&rsquo;s death also has these two aspects. As descendants of Adam, we have both his God-created humanity and his fallen and sinful human element. However, we also have God&rsquo;s element because we are regenerated. By His mercy we need to experience many revivals, have many new beginnings, because we are still full of mixture. Hence, the Lord needs to remove the unclean and improper fallen things of Adam, and He also needs to put to death the good and proper things of our God-created humanity.</p>
<p>A person cannot be put to death by merely enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s love, His abundance, or His sweetness, that is, by knowing Him as &ldquo;a bundle of myrrh&rdquo; and &ldquo;a cluster of henna flowers&rdquo; or by taking Him as &ldquo;the apple tree.&rdquo; On the contrary, the more a person touches the Lord&rsquo;s love and enjoys His sweetness in these ways, the more the element of the self is present. Therefore, the Lord must change the environment and put us into trials, into &ldquo;prisons,&rdquo; such as health problems, family problems, problems in the work, changes in the arrangement among the co-workers, or turmoils in the church. Initially, the believers in Asia welcomed Paul, but eventually they all turned away from him (2 Tim. 1:15). This turning away was more severe than the Roman prison. But it was for Paul to experience being broken and thereby know the resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p>Our spiritual experiences are not according to our desire. It is difficult to find a person who loves the Lord at a young age, who has good health and mental prowess, who advances speedily in every aspect, and who later marries a spiritual spouse and has children who are like Samuel or Timothy, being obedient, intelligent, seeking to be spiritual, having morning watch at the age of seven, reading the Bible with understanding at the age of eight, and knowing how to fellowship with the Lord at the age of nine. Such a child would be ideal, perfect. However, this is all wishful thinking. Similarly, we should not expect that our work will always be effective, that our co-workers will always be in one accord, or that the church under our care will always be prosperous. These are what we desire, but they are never fulfilled.</p>
<p>Our experience is always one of being broken. We may become sick for no reason, and our health may not improve. We may also discover that our spiritual spouse is not spiritual. We may also discover that our child is foolish when we expect him to be intelligent, is mischievous when we expect him to be obedient, and does not love the Lord when we expect him to be spiritual. We may also experience many situations in the work, with our co-workers, with the saints, and in the church, which are like thorns that prick and wound us. Throughout our life&rsquo;s journey our experience is one of being broken. Perhaps some would say that this is very bad, but we must remember that this is a necessary process; it is the pathway that every seeker of the Lord must follow.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
