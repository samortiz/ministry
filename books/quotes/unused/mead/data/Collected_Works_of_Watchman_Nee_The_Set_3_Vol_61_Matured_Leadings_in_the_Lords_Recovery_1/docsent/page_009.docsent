   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Watchman Nee: The few of you in Hong Kong bear a great responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to mention one thing about the meetings in Manila, Singapore, and Hong Kong: The atmosphere in these places is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It has never been right.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The meeting in Amoy is a little better.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes the atmosphere is right, and sometimes it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever I passed through the above three places, the atmosphere always was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The co-workers in Hong Kong have to bear the responsibility for turning around the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Hong Kong the atmosphere makes everything cheap; no one pays much attention to spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A spiritual thing may be very precious in another place, but in Hong Kong, it becomes cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This despising attitude gives me a serious doubt as to your knowledge of the spiritual atmosphere among you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What is an atmosphere?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One sister came to Kuling last year.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This year she came again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She said, "I feel that God is very near to me in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The spiritual things are very weighty and precious here.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But once I return to my own locality, I no longer feel that God is so near to me, and the spiritual things are not as precious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since I am back in Kuling, I sense the nearness of God and the seriousness of spiritual things once more."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Kaung is here.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please forgive me for saying a frank word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The work in all of south China is somewhat frivolous.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Man's natural tendency is to be frivolous.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason you should not be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You should not do anything to encourage others in the direction of frivolity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you cannot do this, you will find as you work in Southeast Asia and in Hong Kong that you may serve others with a bowl of bitter herbs, but they will not feel that they are bitter at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may even think that you are serving them a dessert.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a man is not serious about spiritual things, he will destroy what you have built up the minute you leave the place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One Shanghai brother returned from Hong Kong to Shanghai and said, "Our brothers in Hong Kong are somewhat like members of the YMCA."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This may be too much, but it does speak somewhat of the tendency of that place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are Christians in Christ, and we have to maintain our distinctive characteristics; we must not pick up the local flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, we have to overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to take the strict way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not make others feel that we are basically the same as them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have a few brothers here who are very good brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as we can bring them into a proper spiritual atmosphere, all problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to have a spiritual atmosphere, we have to bear a heavy responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The co-workers must come together to pray at least two or three times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Study the Word together in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the fellowship among the brothers is lacking, we cannot expect the ministry of the word to be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE WAY TO WORK PERFECTING OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In conclusion, the basic need of the work in Hong Kong is for the co-workers to come together more to pray and to study the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Next, they need to produce men and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition to the regular church meetings, we have to pick out three to five relatively mature ones among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Every week we have to be with them for three to five times to cultivate and perfect them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to spend the time to perfect them one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that, in addition to the church meetings, we have to produce men to do the same things that we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord Jesus is our good pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He did not set up any church Himself; He only produced twelve men, and then later seventy others, to do the work of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, one hundred twenty people were perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These ones brought in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in one accord at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church was produced, and in a short time, three thousand and then five thousand more were gained.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In perfecting others we have to pay attention to sanctifying ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In three months' time we will see that all the ones we are perfecting will be just like us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whatever our work may be, the same requirement applies to the person doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to be strict and disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the only way we can produce anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to be strict in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Otherwise, there will be no hope for our future.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The book of Matthew has twenty-eight chapters which basically speak of how to be a disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to do our best to learn to be a disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>INSTRUCTIONS FOR VISITATION</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Visitation is an important work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In visiting others, we should not talk about our family affairs, much less the family affairs of those we are visiting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It may not be that damaging if they bring up such things and we merely listen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But if we talk about such things, this will not bring in any profit, either to us or to them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are not making visitations like social workers in the YMCA.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We visit men as servants of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not speak about worldly things, but instead, we should give them spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Perhaps we should sit down to read the Word with them or pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>After I was saved, a brother frequently came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Every time he came he read a chapter of the Bible with me, and then he gave me a word of encouragement and exhortation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This stirred up my interest for the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If anyone is hurt by anything, we can do our best to render him some help, but we should avoid social visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The church is a place with enough gossip already.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we add more, we will easily ruin its spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In visiting others, we should never try to answer their spiritual questions too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The purpose of visitation is not to solve spiritual problems.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do not go with the intention of expounding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you are not sure of certain things, just say in a simple way that you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You should ask the others to go to the Lord more and seek light and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Give them a spiritual touch.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is better to visit in coordination with a few.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we cannot find a partner, we can still go alone, but we have to be on the alert that we are bringing men to the Lord all the time.</S>
