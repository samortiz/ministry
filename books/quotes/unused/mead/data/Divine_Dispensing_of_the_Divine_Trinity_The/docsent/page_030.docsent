   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE GOD S DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE MINISTRY OF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>PETER, JUDE, AND JAMES Scripture Reading: Acts 3:13; 2 Pet 1:17; Acts 3:15; 2:36; 10:36; 2 Pet 1:1; 3:18; 1 Pet 1:19; 2:4, 7, 25; 5:4; 2:9; 1:18, 2, 3, 23; 2:2-3, 5; 4:17; 5:2; 3:7; 4:10; 2 Pet 1:3-4; 1 Pet 5:10; Jude 20, 21, 24; James 1:17, 18 IN THE MINISTRY OF PETER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the past two messages we saw God s dispensation in the ministry of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we want to see His dispensation in the ministry of Peter, Jude, and James.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Compared to Paul s writings, Peter s are very brief.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet the crucial points in his writings are very similar to the crucial points in Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Paul, though, had at least two particular points which Peter did not mention.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul specifically told us that the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He also told us that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 , and that the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter never told us this, though he mentioned the Spirit of Christ 1 Pet 1:11 , and the Spirit of glory and of God 1 Pet 4:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that according to Peter s understanding the Spirit of God in the New Testament age has become the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Peter also has one precious point which Paul did not mention, that is, we are the partakers of the divine nature 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This item in the Bible is a big diamond.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It means that we are enjoying the divine essence of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are partaking of the divine elements of God s being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such an expression, partakers of the divine nature, is very strong!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am so happy that Peter wrote this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, in the entire Bible there would not be a word telling us that we are now enjoying the very essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a great lack there would be if this were not in the Bible!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I surely would like to have a sign to hang in my room saying: Partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Surely the biggest blessing in the whole universe is that we can partake of God s nature and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is far beyond our understanding and even the more is far beyond our ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are short of the utterance to describe such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What does it mean to partake of the divine nature?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let me illustrate it in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose you have a little creature, a chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A chicken lays eggs, but it never studied in an egg-laying school.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To lay eggs is simply something of the chicken nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this illustration you may have a little apprehension of what it means for us to be partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As soon as we were regenerated there was a kind of nature within us that would not agree for us to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No one had to teach us not to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Something within our nature was telling us that as children of God we should not do that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even as the chicken s nature is in the chicken, so the divine nature is in those who have been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been born of God with God s divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Life and nature cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually the nature is the essence of the life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s nature is within God s life, so the very divine life with which we have been born again has within it the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Right after our regeneration we began to partake of this nature, even unconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me give you another illustration concerning the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A little baby does not have any knowledge about bitterness or sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has not been taught what is bitter or what is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even he does not have such a vocabulary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you put something sweet into his mouth he will swallow it, and if you put something bitter into his mouth he will spit it out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Who taught him to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It comes out of his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His nature rejects the bitterness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whatever is bitter is rejected by his human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whatever is sweet is accepted by his human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Right after he has been delivered, even when he is very young, a baby rejects and accepts certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Likewise, at our regeneration, another nature got into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is the nature of God, the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We began to enjoy this divine nature right after our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As believers we all are partakers of such a divine nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peter did not say we have a divine nature, but that we have become partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is now within us, and we are partaking of it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That means that we are now enjoying it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And we enjoy it unconsciously and unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A little baby rejects the bitterness and receives the sweetness without intention.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you put something bitter into his mouth he rejects it unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the action of his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is hard for us to describe and to know the nature, but we can surely discern the actions of the nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is hard to say what is the chicken nature, but we can discern the actions of the chicken nature.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The main action of the chicken s nature is to lay eggs.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have been born of the divine life, and within the divine life there is the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now we are partaking of this nature and enjoying this nature unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There are too many things that this divine nature within us rejects.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although no one teaches us to reject this thing or to reject that thing, as Christians we just reject it because we have partaken of the divine nature within us.</S>
