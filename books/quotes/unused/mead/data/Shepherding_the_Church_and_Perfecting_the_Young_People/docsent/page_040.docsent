   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Leading the Saints to Grow in Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, the most basic work of the elders is to impart life to the saints; in order to do this the elders need to be desperate to have life themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although some saints love the Lord, they have little growth in life and limited experience and knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders should be desperate to impart the life supply to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If most of the saints in a locality are progressing, the elder should not give ordinary messages or do an ordinary work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He should do his best to supply the saints with what they need at that point.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can do this for him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, a mathematics teacher must think of ways to teach his students multiplication and division.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the students will advance to a higher level.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once the students learn multiplication and division, the teacher must teach them something new.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the teacher has nothing left to teach the students, he must quickly learn something new.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If he is unable to learn, he should ask someone to come and assist him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The elders should lead all the saints to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the elders endeavor in this matter, the church will advance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Since we are short in our own growth in life, it is very difficult for us to lead the church to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the second item of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Supplying the Word</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The third item is that the co-workers must be desperate to have the supply of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A local church always needs the word; doctrines are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There must be the supply of the living word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A local church should have two messages every week to meet two kinds of need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One message should be simple, and the other should be deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will require the co-workers to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the past, one brother would give a message, another brother would call the hymns, and still another brother would pray, and then the meeting would be dismissed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of meeting is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The meetings should enliven the saints and cause them to release their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if in every meeting the saints only release their spirit and there is no living word and no substantive supply in the word, the saints will not receive a solid supply from the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a good meeting at least half an hour to forty minutes must be used for supplying the word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the co-workers should have a supply of the word to impart into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This will cause the saints to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some co-workers said that they do not have the gift of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not fitting for them to say this; it is also not fitting for someone to say that he does not have the gift of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only the dead do not have the gift of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can all speak, just as we can all eat.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some may say that they do not have the gift of cooking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is also not right.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the New Testament Paul says, Having gifts...according to the grace given to us Rom 12:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whether we cook well or not, we all can cook.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It all depends on whether we are desperate and whether we do something with our heart and our strength.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are too kind to ourselves, and we have not been strict with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If, as a co-worker, I do not have a supply of the word, I should be diligent and desperate to produce a living word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I cannot do it myself, there are other full-timers serving with me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I can ask them to endeavor with me.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must endeavor so that we always have a living word, a living supply, for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There are three crucial points that we should focus on.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First, the business affairs of a local church must be delegated to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Second, we must be desperate for the saints to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Third, we must endeavor to have the supply of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nothing is impossible to accomplish to those who are determined.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As long as we are determined, we will accomplish something.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord will give us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are determined, we will find a way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A co-worker serving in a locality should carefully observe the situation in the church and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He may observe that the saints love the Lord, attend the meetings regularly, and tithe, but they do not have a good foundation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He should find a way to give them a foundation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps he realizes that the saints do not adequately know the meaning of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They have been regenerated, but they do not have sufficient knowledge concerning regeneration and do not know the experience of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some co-workers may tell the saints to read books such as The Knowledge of Life,The Experience of Life, Messages for Building Up New Believers, and Lessons for New Believers.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This approach can be likened to buying groceries and then putting them on the table for people to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The groceries still need to be processed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The co-workers cannot expect the saints to receive the supply simply by reading spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In order to fellowship from Lesson 8 in Messages for Building Up New Believers, they must first digest the lesson and then present it to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even if the co-workers are not eloquent, their words will touch the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a co-worker cannot digest a lesson by himself, he should ask a few of his companions for help.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then the saints will receive the help and be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Managing a family depends more on diligence than on competence.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Chinese are smart and capable, but they like to take shortcuts.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A Chinese person may take an hour to finish a job, but a Japanese person will take three hours.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>From this we can see the diligence of the Japanese.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Herein lies the success of the Japanese industries; no one can compete with them in this aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Americans seek efficiency, the Chinese search for shortcuts, and the Japanese strive for perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The disposition of the Chinese people has not been rooted out of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>As soon as we speak of ministering the word, the co-workers think of doing a quick job or depending on others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As a result, the work does not have much effect, nothing substantial is built up, there is not much growth in life, and there is very little supply of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such work is like that of a pastor maintaining a congregation, and it is not of much use.</S>
