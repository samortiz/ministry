   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ITS RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How rich is this book in which God has spoken!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In it is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are asked by a learned professor where Christ is, do not reply that He is in the heavens; that is too far away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not say that He is in your spirit; that is too mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The answer is that Christ is in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the inquirer truly wants to meet Him, let him read John 1:1-29 over and over.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will surely find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Life-study Messages are rich, but not one of them is as rich as the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The writings of Confucius are of a high quality, with profound philosophical and ethical teachings, but they cannot compare with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I studied some of those writings when I was young and I did appreciate them, but once I became familiar with them, there seemed to be not much more to them when I went back to consider them further.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible, in contrast, is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have put out over sixty-five messages on the Gospel of John, yet we could easily have another sixty-five messages without the well running dry!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more we read the Bible, the more riches we discover.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After fifty-five years of loving this book, I am still plumbing its depths and enjoying its riches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ITS CENTRAL THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is best if we come to this Word knowing what its main thought is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whatever part of the Bible we are reading, we should be aware that the basic concept of this holy book is that God desires to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nothing pleases God as much as being one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wants to be us, and us to be Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He would like to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yes, we already have life, but our life is not the real life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is just a vessel, an empty vessel, to contain God as our real life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's desire is that we should be His vessel, containing Him, expressing Him, and living Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day I have the deep conviction within me that I should not live myself out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am just a vessel with God as my life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In my speaking, if I do not contain, express, and convey Him to you, my words are just vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before I speak, I pray, "Lord, I don't want to speak anything from myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I want to speak only You.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If You are not my speaking, whatever I speak is in vain."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do believe that in my speaking the Lord's word is spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we come to the Bible then, we must not think we are coming just to the printed page.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to realize that the Word, God, the Spirit, and the Bible are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In coming to His Word, we come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His intention is not to teach nor correct us; it is rather to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>HOW REALIZED As Nourishment</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By what way does God work Himself into us?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is in the same way that we take food into us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By eating different forms of the animal and vegetable life, we get the essential elements we need to sustain our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we eat may be in the form of apples or cherries, beef or chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But it becomes part of us in the form of nutrients that our bodies can assimilate to keep us alive and healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we eat does not stay in the form of an apple or a chicken; it is digested as vitamins, minerals, protein, and other substances our bodies need.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God Himself is the nourishment we need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both the animal and vegetable life are used in the Bible to illustrate the riches of His nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jesus said to His disciples, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst" John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here Christ likens Himself to barley and wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is symbolized by the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this same chapter John 6 He is also described as being of the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"The bread which I will give is My flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>51-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>From such verses we can see that God would impart Himself into us as nourishment, that our spiritual being might be constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mere instruction in the Christian life is not sufficient; we must have the genuine food.</S>
