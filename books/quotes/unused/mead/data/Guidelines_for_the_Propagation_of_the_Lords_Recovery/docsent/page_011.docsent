   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church life being a meeting life that is communal, not isolated Heb 10:25; Acts 2:46; 1 Cor 14:23a, 26.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We being able to enjoy the richer presence of the Lord in the meetings Matt 18:20.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>DELIVERING THE MEETINGS FROM PROCEDURE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Traditional meetings in Christianity follow certain procedures, but we need to be delivered from rigidly following procedures in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the meetings we sing hymns, give testimonies, expound the Bible, and release God s word, but we should not be influenced by traditional Christianity and follow traditional procedures whenever we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have fellowshipped concerning the exercise of the spirit and the release of the spirit since 1960.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From 1960 to 1961 I wrote eighty-five new hymns in Chinese, which were mainly concerning the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, it seems as if the more I promoted the release of the spirit, the less the saints released their spirit, and eventually there was no release of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul says that we should not quench the Spirit 1 Thes 5:19 , because it is easy to quench the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As believers, we all have a mingled spirit the Spirit and our spirit mingled as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Christian life, work, testimony, and meetings depend on the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, if we quench our spirit instead of exercising it, our life, work, testimony, and meetings will be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our spirit is not exercised, any work that we do will not be the work of the Spirit, and our living will be merely a religious display; we will live and walk according to doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A life that is according to doctrines is not a genuine Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Christian life depends on the life of Christ, and the life of Christ is our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our mingled spirit is the life of Christ Rom 8:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I went to the United States in 1962, I began the work by speaking concerning the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result of this clear speaking, in 1969 the Lord s recovery in the United States reached a climax.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I still appreciate the condition of the churches from 1969 to 1972.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>During this time the meetings in all the churches in the United States reached the highest point.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The meetings did not begin in the meeting halls; they began in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a meeting began at 7:30 in the evening, the saints began to release their spirit in their homes at 6:30.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many brothers and sisters actually lived in the spirit all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When they woke up in the morning, they released their spirit and drew near to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That was the beginning of the evening meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In other words, the evening meeting began when the brothers and sisters had their morning watch.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>During those years the saints were filled in spirit every day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result of daily exercising their spirit, the saints wrote many hymns that are in the English supplement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In addition, an hour before every meeting one could see groups of saints singing on their way to the meeting hall and shouting Amen, Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When in the meeting, the saints did not follow any procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They praised the Lord and shouted Hallelujah.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The meetings were living, and it was easy to release the divine word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The atmosphere of a meeting can function like a water pump and draw words out of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even if a person did not want to speak, it was impossible for him to remain quiet, because the atmosphere of the meeting pulled the words out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, it is not often that such a situation is seen in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This meeting is comparatively good, because it is better than most meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to our habit, we do not testify at the beginning of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We always testify after the message.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This time, we departed from tradition and testified at the beginning of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I agree with this practice, and we all sensed the freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, in the future we should not go back to our old regulations and follow tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our testimonies should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should never keep our old regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to learn to be living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, the saints who did not give a testimony should not consider themselves superior and criticize the saints who testify.</S>
