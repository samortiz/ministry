The sanctification in this stage is mainly dispositional, although there is still an amount of positional sanctification
He is transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit through the working of all things
In the first stage of God's full salvation we are delivered from God's condemnation and from eternal perdition
In the second stage we are being delivered from the power of sin, the world, the flesh, the self, the soul , and individualism
The goal of this deliverance is that we would have maturity in the divine life for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose
By the end of the first stage we have been saved and have cleared the past, and we are ready to go on in our Christian life
Ever since we were saved the Triune God has been dispensing His being with all His divine elements into us for our experience and enjoyment
While we enjoy the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit brings in the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ we have the love of God
In experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing, we experience and enjoy the Father in His love
God the Father is the source of the divine flow, God the Son is the course, and God the Spirit is the flow itself reaching us
The expression 'God is love,' like 'God is light' , and 'God is Spirit' , is used not in a metaphoric sense but in a predicative sense
Spirit denotes the nature of God's person; love, the nature of God's essence; and light, the nature of God's expression
When this divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when this divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth
Galatians 4:6 says, 'Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
Abba' is an Aramaic word, thus a Hebrew, that means father; and 'Father' is the translation of the Greek word pater
When the two terms 'Abba' and 'Father' are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate
Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and the begetting Father
As we fellowship with the Lord, we may sense that the very God with whom we are fellowshipping is above us and overshadowing us
At the same time we have the sense that this loving One is not only overshadowing us but is also passing through us
God dispenses Himself into us in a triune way by overshadowing us, by passing through us, and by dwelling in us
As we experience and enjoy this dispensing, we sense God the Father in three directions-over us, through us, and in us
The Three of the Trinity-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-visit us in a triune way, in a threefold way, for the divine dispensing
To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory
From experience we know that whenever we draw near to God under the redeeming blood of Christ, we have the sense that God is near to us
To those who draw near to God the Father He is near in order to love, sympathize, comfort, encourage, strengthen, and sustain
As we worship God the Father by His Spirit, something of the living God, the One we worship by the Spirit, is wrought into our being
James 4:6 says, 'He gives greater grace; wherefore it says, God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble'
The believers have received the initial grace, yet this grace needs to be multiplied in them that they may participate in all grace
The varied grace of God is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects
The Greek word for 'humble' in 1 Peter 5:5 also means lowly, as in Matthew 11:29, where the Lord Jesus says, 'I am meek and lowly in heart'
There is a condition that we need to fulfill in order for God to give us grace, and this condition is that we must be humble
God the Father not only gives grace to the believers, but He comes to them with the Son and makes an abode with them
The words 'in this' mean in the fact that God has given us of His Spirit we know that we abide in Him and He in us
The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God
To abide in God is to dwell in Him, remaining in our fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us
Out of His Spirit' is an expression which implies that the Spirit of God, whom He has given to us, is bountiful and without measure
By such a bountiful, immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we are one with God and that we abide in Him and He in us
John 4:15 goes on to say, 'Whoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God'
To abide in love is to live a life that loves others habitually with the love which is God Himself so that He may be expressed in us
As God the Father abides in us, we experience and enjoy Him as the loving One, as the One who is the source of love
The surpassing great power of God toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength which He wrought in Christ
The more we fellowship with Him and allow Him to abide in us, the more this power is infused and transfused into our being
If we spend time with our loving Father, we shall be strengthened through His imparting His great power into our being
The indwelling God energizes us from within to be the source, power, strength, and energy for us to experience Christ
Strictly speaking, 'ask or think' here refers to the spiritual things related to the church, not to material things
Our asking and thinking should be focused on God's economy to dispense Himself into us to produce the church as the expression of Christ
When our asking and thinking concern the church, God will always do superabundantly above all that we ask or think
We need to ask and think concerning Christ making His home in our hearts and concerning the church being filled unto all the fullness of God
If we ask and think in this way then whatever we ask or think concerning the church will be answered and it will be answered superabundantly
God's operating superabundantly above all that the believers ask or think is according to the power which operates in them
As we experience and enjoy God as our loving Father, He will operate in us superabundantly above all that we ask or think
In this message we shall consider some finer matters related to the believers' experiencing and enjoying God as the Father in His love
Paul followed the pattern of Christ, willing to be weak in the organic union with Him, that he might live with Him a crucified life
Because the Father always wants to glorify the Son, to magnify Him, the Father lives in us to enable us to live together with Christ
A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen
As believers we have been reconciled to God, having passed through the first veil and having entered into the Holy Place
He exposes our natural life and unveils our real situation to us so that we may condemn our natural being and apply the cross subjectively
In this step the veil of our natural man is rent so that we may be in the Holy of Holies, living in God's presence
Corinthians 5:21 says, 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him'
The phrase 'in Him' in 2 Corinthians 5:21 means in union with Christ, not only positionally but organically in resurrection
God condemned Him in the flesh as sin for us, through His death, that we might be one with Him in His resurrection to be God's righteousness
In the organic union with Christ, those who have been brought back thoroughly to God are made the righteousness of God
Now we may enjoy God as the Father in His love to such an extent that in Christ we become God's very righteousness
The word 'sanctify' here means to be set apart; it is to be separated unto God from all things common or profane
God the Father sanctifies us wholly, so that no part of our being, either of our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane
In quantity God sanctifies us wholly; in quality God preserves us complete, that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect
For this God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element our soul from remaining natural and old and our body from the ruin of sin
Such a preservation by God and His thorough sanctification will sustain the believers to live a holy life unto maturity
Romans 8:10 says that our spirit is life because of righteousness, and verse 6 tells us that the mind set on the spirit is life
Those who are experienced in the Lord care much more for the Fathers giving life to their mortal bodies than for socalled miraculous healing
Spontaneously, the Father imparts the divine life through His indwelling Spirit into their weak, mortal bodies
The Greek word translated 'searches' includes active research and implies accurate knowledge not in discovering but in exploring
The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation
As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether a planter or a waterer, are nothing, and God is everything
It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God , indwelt by the Spirit of God , and mingled with the Spirit of God
Finally, the Father strengthens us into our inner man in order that we may experience Christ unto all the fullness of God
The Greek word poiema means something which has been made, a handiwork, or something which has been written or composed as a poem
Poetry does not consist only of poetic writing; any work of art that expresses the maker's wisdom and design may be considered a poem
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are the highest poetry, expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
As the masterpiece of God's work, we are an absolutely new item in the universe, something newly originated by God
God's masterpiece is the working of Himself into man and the constituting of man into oneness with Himself to produce a marvelous poem
In the ages to come in the millennium and in eternity there will be a unique hymn the church which expresses the wisdom and design of God
When we see the New Jerusalem, we may extol God for the beauty, wisdom, and design manifested in this marvelous production
Today as the believers experience and enjoy God the Father in His love through the triune dispensing, He makes them His poem
By such an inward operating power of life, the gift of grace was given to the apostle, that is, produced in him
As to the person of Paul, he was the least among the apostles , but as to his ministry he was not behind the chiefest apostles
All the members of the Body of Christ can have the same grace of life as Paul, but their gifts are not the same as Paul's
The church as the Body of Christ is brought forth out of the unsearchable riches of Christ, not out of doctrines or systems of organization
In 2 Corinthians 3:5 Paul says, 'Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God'
Only the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit constituted into us is sufficient to carry on the ministry of the New Testament
We shall be ministers not of letter, doctrine, or theology; instead, we shall be ministers of the living Spirit
God the Father leads the believers in Christ's triumphal procession in their ministry and manifests through them the fragrance of Christ
Paul uses this metaphor to illustrate how Christ is the victorious general and how Paul and all believers are His captives
As Paul and his co-workers traveled in the Gentile world for the preaching of the gospel, they were moving in Christ's triumphal procession
The apostles are such incense-bearers in their ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph
In verse 15 Paul says, 'We are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing'
The apostles were a fragrance of Christ to God because they were saturated and permeated by Christ and with Christ
Paul's experience in Philippians 2 indicates that the Father's having mercy on us is also a matter of His dispensing
In verse 26 Paul says of Epaphroditus, 'He was longing after you all and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick'
Paul did not say, 'God performed a great miracle,' but said, 'God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but also on me'
God the Father also encourages, comforts, the believers through Christ that they may encourage, comfort, others
In verse 4 Paul says that we encourage those in affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God
Through their experience of being encouraged through the divine dispensing, they had the riches with which to comfort others
As the apostles were encouraging the saints, they were dispensing into them the riches of the Triune God that they themselves were enjoying
In 15 Paul goes on to say Because even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us so through the Christ our encouragement also abounds
The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received encouragement
Philippians 4:7 says, 'The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus'
We find the antidote to this anxiety when we pray, practice communion with God, and enjoy the Father's dispensing in His love
From experience we know that through prayer we receive the antidote to anxiety when the peace of God is infused into us
In Christ Jesus the peace of God patrols as a guard who goes back and forth before our hearts and our thoughts
In Matthew 6:33 the Lord goes on to say, 'Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you'
The Fathers kingdom is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the coming age
The Father's righteousness is the righteousness by keeping the new law of the kingdom, as mentioned in Matthew 5:20 and 6:1
The Father disciplines us for our profit that we might partake of His holiness , which is the characteristic of His holy nature
God's discipline not only makes us to partake of His holiness but also yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness
If we have not been permeated inwardly with God's holy nature, we cannot have the proper righteousness in our outward behavior
Jude 24 says, 'To Him who is able to guard you from stumbling, and to set you before His glory without blemish in exultation'
Glory here is the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus, which will be manifested at His appearing and in which He will come
The preposition 'in' here means in the element of, and 'exultation' signifies the exuberance of triumphant joy
The Epistle of 1 Peter speaks of the Christian life under the government of God, which is carried out by God's judgment
Romans 16:20 reveals that God crushes Satan under the feet of the believers: 'The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet'
If we are not in the church and do not practice the church life, it will be difficult for us to have Satan crushed under our feet by God
Whenever we are separated from the church, we become a prey for Satan, for it is difficult for us to fight Satan individually
Romans 16 does not refer to the Body in a universal sense, but refers to the local and practical expression of the Body
It is only when we have a proper local church as the practical expression of the Body that Satan is crushed under our feet
As God crushes Satan under our feet in the church life, we have the peace of God as a token of this victory over him
Through the divine dispensing, both the crushing of Satan and the peace of God are experienced by the believers in the church life
In a sense, the believers in Christ are a widow in the present age because their Husband Christ is absent from them
While our opposer is persecuting us, it seems that our God is not righteous, for He allows His children to be unrighteously persecuted
Throughout the centuries thousands upon thousands of faithful followers of the Lord Jesus have suffered unrighteous persecution
When our Husband is apparently absent and we are left on earth as a widow, temporarily our God seems to be an unrighteous judge
Although He appears to be unrighteous, we still must appeal to Him, pray persistently, and bother Him again and again
God shall He not by all means carry out the avenging of His chosen ones who cry to Him day and night and yet He is longsuffering over them
As He answers our cry and avenges us against our enemy, He dispenses Himself into us that we may experience and enjoy Him in His love
In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the believers' experiencing and enjoying God as the Father in His love
Although we have this good pleasure, without God's power we do not have the ability to accomplish what we are glad to do
Between these two steps are God's loving care in His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding us
In all these divine acts, the bountiful supply of the divine life is ministered to us as grace in varied experiences
After God establishes us, He strengthens us, empowers us, and eventually grounds us in Himself as the Triune God
Only the pure gospel, the living Christ, and God's revealed mystery can establish us and keep us in oneness for the church life
In 2 Corinthians 4:14 Paul says, 'Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus, and will present us with you'
To have our mortal body swallowed up by life is to have it transfigured by resurrection life swallowing up the death in our mortal body
In 2 Corinthians 55 Paul goes on to say Now He who has wrought us for this very thing is God who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit
God has given us the Spirit as the pledge of this wonderful and marvelous part of His complete salvation in Christ
On the other hand, transfiguration means that the indwelling Christ is saturating our body and swallowing up the element of death in it
God's fashioning of us for the future in which our mortal body will be swallowed up by life is also God's dispensing
It is by having the Triune God dispensed into us and wrought into us that we are constituted into an inheritance
From the time we were saved, God has been working to transform us, giving us Himself as our enjoyment, our inheritance
We are God's inheritance not in ourselves or by ourselves but by His being our inheritance through the divine dispensing
Our enjoyment of Him in the divine dispensing will consummate in our being God's inheritance for Him to enjoy eternally
The last step of God's great salvation is to bring His many sons into glory, that is, to bring them into His expression
God's leading the believers as His many sons into glory will be the ultimate consummation of the divine dispensing
It is only by the divine dispensing that we shall be constituted into God's inheritance and eventually brought into His glory
May we all see that our loving Father is dispensing Himself into us and that through His dispensing He is bringing us into His glory
In this message we shall begin to consider the believers' experiencing and enjoying Christ as the Son in His grace
In brief, grace is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God experienced and enjoyed by us through the divine dispensing
The love of God the Father is the source, the fount, and the grace of Christ is the flow, the expression, of the love of God
Grace is actually the Triune God embodied in Christ and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our experience and enjoyment
Corinthians 13:14 is our basis for saying that the believers may experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace
With the Father we experience and enjoy the divine love, and with the Son we experience and enjoy the divine grace
As we experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing, we experience and enjoy Christ as the Son in His grace
Paul used this term with the Old Testament record of the allotting of the good land to the children of Israel as the background
After being processed, the Triune God is the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit for us to experience and enjoy
Christ is not only life to us; He, as the bread of life, is our life supply to sustain our spiritual life in Him
To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us to be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life
In 1 Thessalonians 5:10 Paul says that Christ 'died for us that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with Him'
We do not merely live out Christ, live by Christ, live with Christ, live in Christ, and live for Christ-we live Christ
Because Christ lives in us, we, through the divine dispensing, should live Him and thereby be one with Him both in life and in living
In this message we shall cover more aspects of the believers' experiencing and enjoying Christ as the One living in them
According to the book of Galatians, Christ has been revealed in us , He is now living in us , and He will be formed in us
Christ was born into us at our regeneration, now He lives in us in our Christian life, and He will be formed in us at our maturity
Paul was happy in the Lord, and in his happiness he showed forth the immeasurable Christ he experienced and enjoyed
He was a living witness of Christ, testifying of His ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom, all without measure
Although Christ is vast, extensive, and immeasurable, in the eyes of unbelievers He may be virtually nonexistent
As believers, we should be a magnifying glass in relation to Christ so that others may see Christ magnified through us
Those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ's crucifixion
Our boasting, glorying, and rejoicing are not in our outward deeds, not in our behavior or conduct, but in Christ alone
The Judaizers had confidence in the flesh, whereas the true believers in Christ have no confidence in the flesh
At his regeneration he was transferred from the law and his former religion into Christ, and he became 'a man in Christ'
He was a person who lived in Christ, and his aspiration and expectation were that he would be found in Christ by others
If we would be found in Christ, we need to be watchful moment by moment, continually on the alert to live in Christ
All the different gains were counted as one loss by Paul because they all issued in one thing, that is, in the loss of Christ
All the things which were once gains to Paul hindered him and held him back from participating in Christ and enjoying Him
Paul counted as loss on account of Christ not only the things of his former religion but all other things as well
The 'all things' in verse 8 must certainly include the three categories of religious, philosophical, and cultural things
Although it is easy to overcome the influence of material things, it is very difficult to overcome religion, philosophy, and culture
In order to gain Christ, we need to count all things as loss, including the things of religion, philosophy, and culture
The Greek word for 'refuse' in 3:8 refers to dregs, rubbish, filth, what is thrown to the dogs; hence, dog food, dung
The more we count all things loss and refuse on account of Christ, the more we shall gain Christ for our experience and enjoyment
Philippians 310a indicates that Christ lives in us for us to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
We receive the revelation of Christ, and then we seek the experience of Christ-to know and enjoy Him in an experiential way
He was willing to suffer the loss of all things and count them to be refuse that he might gain Christ and be found in Him to know Him
Knowing the power of Christ's resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings are details related to knowing Christ
He is no longer natural and no longer in the flesh-He is in resurrection, and the reality of resurrection is the Spirit
Christ Himself is the power of His resurrection and the Spirit as the reality of the power of Christs resurrection is Christ in resurrection
Because Christ is now in resurrection, we cannot know Him experientially unless we know the power of His resurrection
The process of obtaining Christ, as revealed in Philippians 3:10, is to know Him by knowing the power of His resurrection
If we would know the power of Christ's resurrection, we must share in His sufferings and know the fellowship of His sufferings
With us the power of His resurrection comes first, then the fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death
By this power we are enabled to participate in His sufferings and live a crucified life in conformity to His death
In Colossians 1:24 Paul regarded his own sufferings as the filling up of what is lacking of Christ's sufferings for His Body
There is a difference between those sufferings which are for our transformation and those which are for the Body
In other words, we must have the dispensing of Christ's resurrection so that we may experience His cross, His death
Tis not hard to die with Christ When His risen life we know; 'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings When our hearts with joy o'erflow
Whereas Christ first passed through death and entered into resurrection, we first enjoy His resurrection and then we experience His death
The more we know His resurrection, the more we shall be put into His death to share in the fellowship of His sufferings
In Philippians 3:10 Paul speaks of the fellowship of Christ's sufferings, something in which we are not naturally inclined to share
In Philippians 310 Paul says To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings being conformed to His death
Christ's death is a mold to which we are conformed in much the same way that dough is put into a cake mold and conformed to it
The mold of Christ's death refers to the continual putting to death of His human life that He might live by the life of God
If we put to death our natural life, we shall have the consciousness that we have another life, the divine life, within us
Being conformed to Christ's death is related to knowing both the power of Christ's resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
The words 'being conformed' indicate how we may know the power of Christ's resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings
By being conformed to the death of Christ we experience the power of His resurrection and enter into the fellowship of His sufferings
By participating in Christ's sufferings, we are ushered into a position to experience the power of His resurrection
In Christ's death our natural man with the natural life, the old man, and the self are continually put to death
If we behave in our natural man, in our old man, or in the self, we do not bear the image of the death of Christ
We need to be impressed with the fact that Christ's death is a form, a mold, and that we are the 'dough' that is placed into this mold
The more we experience this, the more we know Christ, His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death
It equals the crown of righteousness in 2 Timothy 4:8, and it is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course
Since Paul was martyred and martyrdom is certainly an evil work, we may wonder whether the Lord actually delivered Paul from every evil work
Martyrdom ushered Paul into the heavenly kingdom, and this ushering into the heavenly kingdom was a deliverance
The sufferings through which we pass are also a deliverance in that suffering delivers us into something higher
Whenever a believer is being martyred out of love for the Lord, the Lord infuses, dispenses, all His riches into such a martyred one
Paul suffered from a 'thorn in the flesh' , and he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him
The Greek word translated 'tabernacle' in 2 Corinthians 12:9 is episkenoo, a compound verb composed of epi and skenoo
It portrays how the power of Christ, even Christ Himself, dwells upon us as a tent spread over us, overshadowing us in our weaknesses
For this reason, Paul would most gladly boast in his weaknesses, that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him
Both are actually the resurrected Christ Himself, who is now the life-giving Spirit dwelling in us for our enjoyment
It is the converse of the Lord's word concerning our organic relationship with Him in John 15:5, 'Apart from Me you can do nothing'
The 'all things' in Philippians 4:13 refer to the things mentioned in verse 12 and to the virtues listed in verse 8
By the empowering of Christ we can live a contented life and be true, honorable, righteous, pure, lovely, and well-spoken of
The fact that man was made in the image of God means that he was made in the form of love, light, holiness, and righteousness
In order to live Christ as our human virtues for the expression of the divine attributes, we need to be empowered by the indwelling Christ
When Christ lives in us, is formed in us, makes His home in us, and is magnified in us, the way is prepared for Him to empower us
Empowered by the indwelling Christ, we shall be able to do all the things spoken of in Philippians 4:8 through 12
Ephesians 3:17a indicates that Christ lives in the believers for them to have Him making His home in their hearts
Our heart is composed of the three parts of our soul-the mind, the emotion, and the will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit
Through regeneration Christ came into our spirit , and now we should allow Him to spread Himself into every part of our hearts
When Christ makes His home in our hearts, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself
For Christ to make His home in our hearts means that He settles Himself in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience
We have believed in the Lord Jesus, and we have Him within us, but He still needs to make His home in our heart
Although we have Christ in us in a general way we may not have Him in us in a particular way saturating our mind emotion will and conscience
We may have received Christ into a corner of our 'living room,' but have not given Him the liberty to spread in us
We are short of the divine dispensing into our mind, emotion, will, and conscience to saturate our entire being
If we have been thoroughly saturated with Christ through the divine dispensing into every part of our inward being, we shall be strong
In speaking of our having been rooted and grounded, Paul indicates that the experience of Christ is for life and building
The love in which we are rooted and grounded is the divine love realized and experienced by us in a practical way
In previous messages we covered many aspects of the believers' experiencing and enjoying Christ as the Son in His grace
In Ephesians 3:18 Paul speaks of being 'strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth'
In order to grasp the dimensions of Christ we need all the saints, for we apprehend these dimensions not individually but corporately
The dimensions of Christ are the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth-the dimensions of the universe
If we experience Christ properly and normally as the breadth and the length, we shall be kept from going to an extreme
As we experience the dimensions of Christ in the church life, we find that His breadth and length are immeasurable
As we experience Christ in His spreading, we come to see that the dimensions of the universe are the very dimensions of Christ
After we experience the breadth and length of Christ, we begin to experience the height of Christ and then the depth
Our experience of Christ in the church must be cubical, three dimensional, with many lines going back and forth in all three directions
As we go back and forth and up and down in our experience of Christ, we eventually have a solid, cubical experience of Him
Because Christ is immeasurable, His love is knowledge-surpassing; yet we can know it in our spirit, not by knowledge but by experience
Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable love is like a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience
According to this rendering, the fullness of God would have to be the element, the essence, with which we are filled
Paul is saying that we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, we shall be filled to be the expression of God
As Christ makes His home in our hearts, we are filled not with all the fullness of God but unto all the fullness of God
Eventually, we shall be filled with the processed Triune God to such an extent that we shall become His full expression
We can be filled with the Triune God to such a measure and can attain to such a standard, even unto all the fullness of God
When we speak of the fullness of God, we imply that the riches of all that the Triune God is have become His expression
The fullness in Ephesians 3:19 does not mean the riches; it denotes the expression, the manifestation, of the riches
The fullness of God is the issue of the believers' being constituted metabolically through their experience of the riches of Christ
We shall become strong to grasp Christ experientially in His universal dimensions both horizontally and vertically
The building up in 2:7 is not that of the Body corporately but that of the building up of the members individually
As those who have been rooted in Christ, we need to remain in our spirit absorbing the rich nourishment of Christ
The Spirit is the Triune God after He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Having passed through this process, the Triune God is now the consummate Spirit for the believers' experience and enjoyment
Corinthians 13:14 speaks of 'the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit'
The love of God the Father is the source, and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ is the flow, the expression, of love
We have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit-the full enjoyment of the Triune God
The Spirit is the means for God the Father to strengthen the believers into their inner man that Christ may make His home in their hearts
The Spirit is the means for the believers to guard the good deposit , and unto Him they sow and of Him they reap in their life
The Spirit is the firstfruit of the believers' divine inheritance and also the access for them to contact the Triune God
The Spirit rests upon the believers as glory when they are reproached and vindicates the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh
The Spirit gives the believers utterance to speak in different tongues and witnesses of the resurrected and exalted Christ
After a person is saved and clears the past, he is ready to experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing
Verse after verse in the New Testament indicates that the processed Triune God is dispensing Himself into us in a triune way
We all need to see the vital matter of the experience and enjoyment of the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing
Even though they sin only occasionally, not habitually, their sinning is an adequate proof that they still have sin working within them
On the other hand, in practicality our old creation, our old man, is still with us, and we are still very much under its influence
John 19 says If we confess our sins He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
Confession here denotes the confession of our sins, our failures, after regeneration, not the confession of our sins before regeneration
Even though we have been saved and regenerated and are under the transformation of the Holy Spirit, it is still possible for us to sin
Such forgiveness of God for the restoration of our fellowship with Him is conditional and depends on our confession
His word is the word of the truth of His gospel , which tells us that He will forgive us our sins because of Christ
The Old Testament way for God to forgive His people's sins was through the offerings that were types pointing to the coming Christ
The New Testament way for God to forgive us is for Him to take the ground of Christ's death on the cross for our sins
The believers experience God's redemption not only in being forgiven of their sins but also in being washed, cleansed
Sins indicate the offense of our wrongdoings against God and men; unrighteousness indicates the stain of our wrongdoings
The blood by which we are cleansed is the blood of a wonderful person-the Lord Jesus-who has both humanity and divinity
Romans 622 says Having been freed from sin and having been enslaved to God you have your fruit unto sanctification and the end eternal life
With Christ as the sanctifying life we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will
In John 17:17 the Lord Jesus says in His prayer to the Father, 'Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth'
The word of God as the truth conveys the reality of God the Father's holiness, which is an attribute of the holy nature of God
God's word as the truth conveys the reality of God the Father's holiness because it conveys the holy nature of God the Father
The word carries God's holy nature and imparts this nature into our being so that we may be sanctified subjectively
Hebrews 12:10 tells us that God the Father disciplines us 'for our profit that we might partake of His holiness'
The implication here is that while we are pursuing peace with all men, we must also pay attention to the matter of holiness before God
Peter 1:15 says, 'According to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also become holy in all your manner of life'
Peter 3:11 says, 'All these things being thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness'
How wonderful that the divine power has provided us with all things that are needed to live such a life in the holy manner and godliness
Honor is a matter of nature, sanctified a matter of position, useful a matter of practice, and prepared a matter of training
In 2 Corinthians 7:1 Paul says, 'Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God'
Holy means not only sanctified, separated, unto God; it also means different, distinct, from everything that is common
Finally, for the believers to be sanctified is for them to be sanctified wholly in their body, soul, and spirit
The word 'sanctified' here means to be set apart; it is to be separated unto God from things common or profane
God sanctifies us wholly, so that no part of our being, either of our spirit or soul or body, will be left common or profane
Now we shall see that the believers experience God's redemption also in being justified and in being reconciled to God in the second step
We are washed from sinful things; second, we are sanctified, separated, unto God; and third, we are justified, accepted, by God
We need to live in Christ, remain in Christ, lodge in Christ, speak in Christ, act in Christ, and move in Christ, having our being in Christ
Not having my own righteousness but the righteousness which is of God' is the condition in which Paul desired to be found in Christ
Faith is the basis, the condition, for us to receive and possess the righteousness out of God, the highest righteousness, which is Christ
There will be no reality in these times unless we fulfill the condition of having the righteousness of God through the faith of Christ
The more we gain Christ and live in Him, the more He as our righteousness will become our expression before both God and man
To be justified by faith is for receiving the divine life ; to be justified by works is through living the divine life
Abraham's offering of Isaac and Rahab's receiving the messengers and thrusting them out are both works which issued from their living faith
The latter is the cause, bringing forth the first, and the first is the effect, the outcome and proof of the latter
Corinthians 5:21 says, 'Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God's righteousness in Him'
Now in resurrection Christ comes into us as life, and this life lives within us to constitute us into the righteousness of God
In substitution Christ was made sin for us, and now, in His constitution, we become the righteousness of God in Him
The phrase 'in Him' in 2 Corinthians 5:21 means in union with Christ, not only positionally but organically in resurrection
The second step of reconciliation is as believers living in the natural life to be reconciled to God from the flesh
A sinner was brought to God through the reconciliation of the atoning blood to enter into the Holy Place by passing this screen
You may be very good, nice, pious, 'holy,' and 'spiritual,' yet you know that there is still something separating you from God's presence
In order that we may be reconciled to God in full, the Father exposes our natural life and unveils our real situation to us
In 2 Corinthians 5 Paul does not say that Christ died for our sins; rather, he says that Christ died for us, for our being
The believers are reconciled to God in the second step by God entreating them through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ
Their natural life was a veil separating them from God's presence, and it was necessary for this veil to be riven
We see that God entreats the believers through the apostles as ambassadors of Christ to be fully reconciled to Himself
Finally, the believers are reconciled to God in the second step in order to become God's righteousness in Christ
In the organic union with Christ, those who have been reconciled to God in the second step become the very righteousness of God
When we were saved, we went through the process of being forgiven, washed, sanctified, justified, and reconciled
Whenever they offered the burnt offering for God's satisfaction, they also had to offer the sin offering and the trespass offering
Because of our sins and trespasses and because of our sinful nature, we need Christ as our trespass offering and sin offering
Throughout our Christian life we need God's forgiveness, washing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation
While we are enjoying the triune dispensing of the processed Triune God, we need to experience God's redemption continuously
To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into a spiritual and mystical union with Him
From both the truth of the Word and our Christian experience we know that we may experience and enjoy the Triune God
The eternal life we have received brings us into the divine fellowship, and the divine fellowship brings us into the divine light
Realizing that we need God's forgiveness and the cleansing of the blood of Jesus, we make our confession to the Lord
By this cycle, which continues in a deeper way day by day and even moment by moment, we grow in the divine life
In this message we shall begin to consider this dispensing in the divine transformation for the divine conformation
The enjoyment of the Father in His love, of the Son in His grace, and of the Spirit in His fellowship is a matter of God's dispensing
The enjoyment of the processed Triune God in love, grace, and fellowship is for transformation, and transformation results in conformation
The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation by being transformed
The Spirit's work in transforming us involves a change in our whole being-in life, nature, essence, element, form, and appearance
Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; transformation is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being
Later, the Lord appeared to one of the strongest Judaizers, Saul of Tarsus, called him, and brought him out of the bondage of the law
Now the Spirit of the Lord is with us, and we have full liberty, full freedom, from the bondage of the Old Testament code of the law
The Lord being the Spirit is to free us from regulations, rituals, religious teachings, and traditional doctrines
Today, however, is not the age of the law of letters but the age of the Lord Jesus being the pneumatic Christ, the Spirit
Because the Lord is the Spirit who gives freedom, when the heart turns to Him, the heart is freed from the bondage of the letter of the law
Paul's word about beholding and reflecting with unveiled face was written with his background in Judaism in mind
In addition to the religious concepts that veil people, every person is veiled by certain natural concepts or ideas
The various national characters, dispositions, habits, and customs are veils that keep us from beholding and reflecting the Lord
With an unveiled face we shall behold and reflect the glory of the Lord and shall be transformed into His image
In 2 Corinthians 3:18 the words 'beholding and reflecting as a mirror' are the translation of a single word in Greek
The 'same image' means that we are being conformed to the resurrected and glorified Christ, being made the same as He is
When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the element of what He is and what He has done
The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence
In 3:18 we have the thought of being transformed into the same image, the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ
Based upon this fact and upon Paul's use of the word 'transformed,' we may speak of being metabolically constituted into the image of Christ
In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
Because a carnation seed dies when it is sown into the soil, we may say that its blossoming is its resurrection
To be transformed from glory to glory far surpasses a mere outward improvement of behavior according to religious or ethical teachings
In order for the Spirit to do His transforming work in us, there is the need for a certain essence to be dispensed into us by the Spirit
When we received Christ, the Spirit of the Lord came into our spirit to regenerate us by imparting Christ into our spirit as life
By this divine act not only was our deadened spirit made alive, but the life of God with its divine nature was put into it
Now it is the Lords desire that this change of life continue by spreading into our soul so that our mind emotion and will may be transformed
We need Him to expand continually from our spirit into our soul till every part of our soul is transformed into His image
We shall have the likeness of the Lord in our practical life because our soul has been thoroughly saturated with His divine element
If the mind is saturated and occupied by the Lord, the Lord will certainly take over our emotion and possess our will
It is for this reason we are told in Romans 12:2 that the transformation of the soul is by the renewing of the mind
As this process takes place, the mingled spirit enters our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind
The more we turn to the spirit of the mind and walk in the spirit of the mind, the more our mind will be renewed
The old element, the element of Adam, is discharged, and the new element, the element of Christ, is added to take its place
We need to be impressed with the fact that when our mind is taken over by our spirit, our human spirit becomes the spirit of the mind
In a very real sense, our regenerated spirit, mingled with the Holy Spirit, not only influences our mind but overrules and dominates it
The spirit's spreading itself into the mind to take over the mind and thus become the spirit of the mind is for continuous transformation
Gold, silver, and precious stones signify various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God
These precious materials are the products of our participation in and enjoyment of Christ in our spirit through the Holy Spirit
Gold, the first of the precious materials mentioned by Paul, refers to the first of the Trinity, God the Father
Redemption, therefore, involves termination, being brought back to God, and being replaced with what Christ is
The third item of the precious materials mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:12 refers to the third of the Trinity, the Spirit
To experience the transforming work of the Spirit is to undergo a metabolic change by the divine life within us
Transformation involves a change in form, whereas conformation involves the shaping of this form into a certain image, the image of Christ
Christ's divine sonship has two aspects: the aspect of the only begotten Son and the aspect of the firstborn Son
Acts 13:33, which quotes from Psalm 2:7, indicates that Christ was begotten as the Son of God on the day of His resurrection
As to His divinity there was no need for Him to be begotten as the Son of God, but as to His humanity there was the need for this
Christ's being the firstborn Son of God implies that He has many brothers and that He is the Firstborn among these brothers
In Christ's resurrection millions of God's sons were born to be the brothers of Christ, the firstborn Son of God
The designation of the one Son is related to the prototype; the conformation of the many sons is the work of mass production
For this reason, we need to be saved in the life of Christ from self-likeness, that is, from the expression, the appearance, of the self
We have been predestinated to be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son so that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers
He is the firstborn Son, and we, according to God's predestination, are the many sons who are being conformed to the image of the Firstborn
He has both the divine nature and the human nature, and we, His many brothers, have both the human nature and the divine nature
Because both He, the firstborn Son, and we, the many sons, are the same in the divine life and nature, He is not ashamed to call us brothers
As the divine life grows within us and transforms us, it spontaneously shapes us into the form, the image, of the firstborn Son of God
Concerning this, only one thing is prevailing-the divine life that grows in us, sanctifies us, transforms us, and shapes us
The mold of Christ's death refers to the continual putting to death of His human life so that He might live by the life of God
As we are undergoing the process of transformation and conformation, we are being conformed to the death of Christ
In Matthew 16:24 the Lord Jesus said, 'If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me'
The Lord's word here does not have the concept of suffering; His concept concerning the cross is that of killing
All those who have experienced the cross agree that one who bears the cross cannot be separated from the cross
The meaning of bearing the cross is to identify ourselves with the crucified Christ and then to stay with Him in His death
We need to have a clear vision that bearing the cross is not a matter of suffering but of keeping the self under the termination of death
We need to pray that the Lord will give us a clear vision of the fact that we are in Him and that we have been crucified with Him
If we have a clear vision of the fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ, we shall know this fact in its reality
The crucifixion of the old man had to be accomplished by someone else, but the crucifixion of the flesh must be carried out by us
The second fact, our crucifixion of the flesh, is the application of the first fact, Christ's crucifixion of the old man
Paul's use of the perfect tense to describe this indicates that such should be the normal experience of the believers
Not only do we have this base objectively, but we have the Spirit subjectively to enable us to execute the cross of Christ upon our flesh
The more we experience the Spirit in this way, the more we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God
To crucify the flesh by the Spirit is to experience the death of Christ in a practical way and not to live habitually according to the flesh
If by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body-that is, to mortify or crucify them-we shall live in spirit
Romans 8:13 corresponds to 8:6, which says that the mind set on the flesh is death and that the mind set on the spirit is life
In order to put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to spirit
The genuine experience of the co-crucifixion with Christ is to be had in putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit
Every practice of the body must be put to death by turning our mind to the spirit and setting it on the spirit
To put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit means that we do not live habitually according to the flesh
Because opinions are the expression of the self, we need to deny the self by applying the cross to our opinions
The objective fact in dealing with the self is that our old man, which includes the self, has been crucified with Christ
In order to deny the self, we need to see, through divine revelation, that our old man has been crucified with Christ
Only as we live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is our seeing a real seeing and our experience a real experience
If we desire to live continuously in the experience of denying the self, we need to live in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
In following the Lord we should not save our soul life, that is, we should not let the soul have its enjoyment
Enjoyment in this age, they will cause their soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in the coming kingdom age
To identify ourselves with Christ's death is to bear the cross, and to bear the cross is to deny our soul life
After being organically united with Him through faith they should remain on the cross keeping their old man in the termination of the cross
As we remain in this crucifixion, this termination, experiencing the death of Christ subjectively, we lose our soul
For the believers to lose their soul is to hate their fathers mothers wives children brothers sisters and moreover their own soul life
The salvation here is full salvation the salvation which is in three stagesthe initial stage the progressing stage and the completing stage
In that realm we shall have the full enjoyment of the Triune God and of all that He is, has, and has accomplished, attained, and obtained
None of these things can remain in the mold of the death of Christ, for Christ's death cuts these things off, kills them, nullifies them
For us to be conformed to Christ's image, we must be dealt with by the cross and thereby be conformed to His death
Hebrews 10:19 says, 'Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus'
Because He is within the veil, we must enter within the veil so that we may see Him and consider Him in order to receive His infusion
We are saturated and permeated with the divine riches that make us the corporate reproduction of the firstborn Son of God for His expression
Now through the riven veil of the flesh and by the blood of Jesus we can enter into the Holy of Holies to contact God for our enjoyment
In Hebrews 10 we are told that now, in the New Testament age, there is a new way of entering into the Holy of Holies
Hebrews 4:16 speaks of coming 'forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help'
The throne of God is the throne of authority to all the universe on which God sits to control and rule over the universe
It takes no time whatever to enter into the Holy of Holies, because there is no distance between it and our spirit
When we are in a pitiful condition, His mercy reaches us and brings us into a state where God is able to favor us with His grace
After the Lord told Peter to follow Him, Peter turned to John and said to Jesus, 'Lord, and what about this man'?
The Lord was telling Peter that what would happen to John was none of his business and that he had to follow Him
Both in the book of Hebrews and in typology the camp signifies the organization of religion, which is human and earthly
In the book of Hebrews both the gate and the camp signify the Jewish religion with its two aspects, the earthly and the human
Every religion is both a human organization and an earthly realm which keeps people from God's New Testament economy
Any religion-Judaism, Catholicism, or Protestantism- which has rejected the Lord is a camp, a human organization, given up by Him
The book of Hebrews instructs and charges us to come forward to the Holy of Holies and to enter within the veil
Although the Lord Jesus first went outside the gate and then entered within the veil, it is exactly the opposite with us
The goal and ultimate conclusion of this book is that we all would enter within the veil and then go outside the camp
The more we are in our spirit enjoying the heavenly Christ, the more we shall be outside religion following the suffering Jesus
To be in our spirit to enjoy the glorified Christ enables us to come outside religion to follow the rejected Jesus
The more we contact the heavenly Christ in His glory in our spirit the more we shall go to the lowly Jesus in His suffering outside religion
Within the veil we behold the glorified Christ that we may be attracted to follow the suffering Jesus outside the camp
We also participate in the ministry of the heavenly Christ that we may be equipped to minister Him to the thirsty spirits outside the camp
The Holy of Holies, the pathway of the cross , and the kingdom are three crucial matters set forth in the book of Hebrews
The Holy of Holies enables us to take the pathway of the cross, and the pathway of the cross ushers us into the kingdom in its manifestation
Peter 221 says To this you were called because Christ also suffered on your behalf leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps
Literally, the Greek word means a writing copy, an under-writing for students to use in tracing letters as they learn to draw them
The Lord Jesus has set His suffering life before us as an under-writing for us to copy by tracing and following His steps
The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity by taking the Lord's yoke on them and learning from Him
The Lord Jesus always submitted to the Father's will, taking God's will as His portion and not resisting anything
If we are meek and are content to remain in a lowly state, nothing will trouble us, and we shall enjoy the rest of Christ
To live to the law means that we are under the law, directed by the law, governed by the law, and have the responsibility to fulfill the law
He wants us to experience the putting to death of Jesus so that our natural man and our active being may be terminated
We may be active or aggressive for the Lord in a natural way, doing things for Him by our natural aggressiveness
When the ancient Romans referred to the believers as Christians, they meant that these people belonged to Christ
The practical meaning of the title Christian is not that we are people for Christ but that we are people belonging to Christ
In 2 Corinthians 515 Paul says that the Lord Jesus died on behalf of all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him
To live to ourselves means that we are under our own control, direction, and governing and that we care for our own aims and goals
When we are thus constrained, we are limited, as if walking on a narrow, walled road, and we are forced to go in a certain direction
The believers' living to Christ proves that they are the Lord's and that Christ is their Lord who died to purchase them to Himself
Our living to the Lord is a declaration, a proclamation, that we belong to Him and thus live to Him as our goal
Romans 84 says That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to flesh but according to spirit
According to the context of chapter five the Spirit in 516 must be the Holy Spirit who dwells in our regenerated spirit and mingles with it
To walk by the Spirit is to have our practical living and acts in our daily life guided and ruled by the Spirit
The Greek word for walk in verse 16, peripateo, means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about
The Greek word for walk in verse 25, stoicheo, means to march in military rank by keeping step, that is, to walk orderly
In the first kind of walk we are free to walk about, but in the second kind of walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step
When we take the Spirit as the essence of our life, we shall then be able to take the Spirit as the path for our way
We have a wonderful mingled spirit, our human spirit regenerated by the divine Spirit and indwelt by the divine Spirit
As the believers set their mind on the mingled spirit and walk according to this spirit, they are freed from the law of sin and of death
Every kind of life, including the satanic life and the divine life, has such a law, which is the innate ability of that life
Because these highest characteristics and capabilities constitute the law of the life of God, this law is the highest law
The law of the Spirit of life is nothing less than the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit to dwell within us
In our experience the evil law is defeated, and we are in Christ enjoying another law, the highest law, the law of the Spirit of life
Romans 8:4 indicates that when we walk according to spirit, the righteous requirements of the law are fulfilled in us
If we walk according to the mingled spirit, all the righteous requirements of the law will be fulfilled spontaneously
For this reason, Paul gives us a unique commandment-to live, walk, and have our being according to the mingled spirit
When we walk according to spirit, we have a standard of morality much higher than that required by the Mosaic law
As the believers walk by the Spirit, they do not fulfill the lusts of the flesh but instead bring forth the fruit of the Spirit
When we live to Christ and walk according to spirit, we have no interest or willingness to fulfill the lusts of our flesh
These virtues are different aspects of the expression of the unique living fruit that is produced by walking by the Spirit
He who sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life'
To sow for the fulfilling of the purpose of the flesh issues in corruption, and corruption, no doubt, includes death
To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires
The believers regulate their life and conduct themselves by faith, as testified in Hebrews 11, not by that which is seen
In these chapters, the crucial center of the Gospel of John, it is not the Lord's intention to give a superficial sermon to His followers
Christ and His members have been brought together into a divine constitution to form an organic entity, the organism of the divine Trinity
As those living in the organism of the divine Trinity, the believers have been convicted by the Spirit of reality
In John 16:9 the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit of reality will convict the world concerning sin 'because they do not believe in Me'
Anyone who does not believe in the Son of God will remain a sinner in Adam until the time comes for him to be judged
If we believe in Christ, we receive the righteousness of God in Christ, a righteousness which is Christ Himself
Finally, the Spirit of reality convicts 'concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged'
God loves the world and has no intention that any human being be cast into the lake of fire, the judgment intended for the Devil
If someone remains a companion of Satan by refusing to believe in the Son God has no choice but to allow that one to suffer Satans judgment
In these verses the convicting work of the Spirit of reality is related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan
As Christ's members, we live in the organism of the divine Trinity and participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity
The Lord indicates that the disciples were like a woman travailing in birth, and He was the child to be brought forth in His resurrection
The believers have been brought forth as a new child through Christ's going and coming, that is, through His death and resurrection
By the word 'coming' the Lord was referring to something that was to happen only a few days later-His resurrection
When the disciples heard about the Lord's going, they were disappointed, thinking that they would lose their dear Lord
He comforted them by indicating that He would go through death in order to come to them in resurrection and enter into them
On the day of His resurrection the Lord came back to the disciples to breathe Himself into them as the Spirit of the divine realities
The new child is the aggregate of all the children or sons of God brought forth with Christ in His resurrection as His many brothers
The new child is the aggregate of all the children of God regenerated by God through the resurrection of Christ
The old man was created by God in Genesis 1 and 2, but the new man was born through the resurrection of Christ
The Head is the firstborn Son of God, and the Body is a composition of all the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Lord
Christ and the believers, the vine with the branches, form the organism of the divine Trinity in the divine dispensing
Everything that God the Father is and has is for the vine as the center and is embodied and expressed through this center
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me
Because we are branches to the Lord and the Lord is the vine to us, we must abide in Him and let Him abide in us
Out of this abundance there will be a flow that will reach others, penetrating into their lives, and this flow will bear fruit
With the vine we have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing
Apart from the fruit borne by the branches, the essence, substance, and life of the vine are concealed and confined
As we abide in the vine to bear much fruit, a transaction takes place which results in the glorification of the Father
Now we shall go on to see that the believers are indwelt by the Spirit and participate in the dispensing of the divine Trinity
John 2022 also indicates that the Spirit enters into us When He had said this He breathed into them and said to them Receive the Holy Spirit
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise that the Spirit of reality would dwell in us
Because the Father and the Son dwell in our spirit with the Spirit, we sense that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us
For the Spirit to come from the source does not mean that He leaves the source; it means that the source comes with Him
The reason for this is that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit cannot be separated, because all Three are one
Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are distinct, they are one, inseparable, indivisible, and undivided
The all-inclusive Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, is fully realized as the Spirit who dwells within us
The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit
The Lord went away through death in order to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit
After this change had been accomplished, Christ's reality became the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit became the Spirit of reality
Whatever the Son is, has, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained is being wrought into us through the Spirit
In John 14:16 the Lord Jesus says, 'I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever'
John 14:16-20 reveals that the other Comforter to be given is the reality of the Comforter who was asking the Father
Because the Spirit is sent by the Father in the Son's name, so the Spirit comes in the name of the Son with the Father
The Father has given all that He has to the Son, and the Spirit receives what is the Son's and discloses it to the believers
We have all three: the Father as the source, the Son as the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit as the transfiguration of the Son
The Father's fullness is the Son's fullness, and the Father's life and nature are also the Son's life and nature
In John 16:14b the Lord Jesus, speaking of the Spirit of reality, says, 'He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you'
All that the Father is and has is the Son's, and all that the Son is and has obtained has been received by the Spirit
According to John 15:26, the Spirit of reality testifies concerning Christ, and according to 16:14a, He will glorify Christ
All things of the Father are Thine; All Thou art in Spirit is mine; The Spirit makes Thee real to me, That Thou experienced might be
John 16:14 and 15 unveil the transmission of the divine Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, into the believers
Now the Son has not only what the Father has but also all the riches in His incarnation human living crucifixion resurrection and ascension
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us
Our participation in the dispensing of the divine Trinity is for the Father to be glorified in the glorification of the Son
In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle
Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him
In verse 24 the Lord says, 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
From this we see that for the Lord to be glorified is for Him to die and be resurrected in order to bear much fruit
John 12:23 reveals clearly that the Lord Jesus was concerned for His glorification, and verse 24 explains what this glorification is
The Lord was glorified by dying as a grain of wheat and then growing up in resurrection to produce many grains, that is, to bear much fruit
For the Son of Man to be glorified is for Him to have His divine element released, expressed, and multiplied through death and resurrection
The building up of the Father's house is equal to the planting of the vine, and this is equal to the birth of the new man
The Lord Jesus said, 'In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples'
The organism of the vine with its branches is for the glorification of the Son that the Father may be glorified in Him
The believers enjoy the dispensing of the divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation
In the section of the Gospel of John from 12:23 to the end of chapter seventeen we see the real significance of the divine dispensing
In the divine transformation we are enjoying the divine dispensing for conformation to the image of the firstborn Son of God
As we participate in this dispensing of the divine Trinity the Son is glorified in us and the Father is glorified in the Sons glorification
Ephesians 5:18b says, 'Be filled in spirit,' and Colossians 3:16a says, 'Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly'
To be filled in spirit is to be filled in our regenerated spirit, the human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
In our language there may not be such a thing as active-passive, but in God's New Testament economy active-passive is a great matter
Peter's word in Acts 2:40 helps us to understand how 'be filled' in Ephesians 5:18 is a matter of active-passive
Just as God has done everything necessary for us to be saved, He has done everything necessary for us to be filled in our regenerated spirit
If we are filled in our spirit with the Spirit, the issue will be a proper Christian life, church life, individual life, and family life
The word of the Lord must have adequate room within us so that it may operate and minister the riches of Christ into our inner being
Whenever we come to the written word we should have the conviction deep within that we are contacting the Lord Himself as the living Word
As we receive the word of Christ, even Christ Himself, we should give the word the freedom to make its home in us
Many readers of John 6 are puzzled by the Lord's word in verse 63, not knowing what it means for His words to be spirit and life
Today the incarnated crucified resurrected and ascended Christ is the lifegiving Spirit and this Spirit is embodied in the word of the Bible
At the beginning of the Gospel of John, Christ is the Word, but at the end of this Gospel He breathes out the Spirit
The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches
It is actually dangerous to have the Spirit without the Word, for then we are in an unlimited and unrestricted sphere
We are charged to be filled in spirit with the Spirit, and we are also charged to let the word of Christ dwell in us richly
Concerning the Spirit, there are two extremes, one found among fundamentalists and the other among Pentecostalists
Because they are afraid of the experience of the Spirit, certain fundamental Christians care primarily for Bible doctrine
Fundamental Christians are often afraid to hear about the experience of Christ, the Spirit, and the inner life
Just as our life and our physical body are one entity, one complete living organism, so the Spirit and the Word are one
Just as it is the invisible life within our body which makes our body vigorous and active, it is the Spirit who causes the Word to be living
In Ephesians 424 Paul tells us that we have put on the new man which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth
In this corporate new man there is no Greek or Jew, no bond or free, no barbarian or Scythian, but Christ is all and in all
As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, but as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person
It was in the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created
When we live and speak truth , we express God as our reality, and others receive God as grace for their enjoyment
If we would be conformed to the image of Christ, that is, if we would learn Christ, we need both the principles and the details
When we have sufficient grace, we shall be filled with Christ as our enjoyment, and there will be no room in us for bitterness of any kind
If we are filled with grace then in place of bitterness wrath anger and clamor we shall have kindness patience mercy forgiveness and grace
We desire to have kindness, patience, endurance, gentleness, mercy, love, and various other virtues and qualities
What a difference it makes in our daily living when we are happy and satisfied through the enjoyment of God in Christ as grace!
Ephesians 4:25 says, 'Having put off the falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another'
If we have the enjoyment of Christ, then in a practical way in our daily living, we shall put off every false thing
We, the believers, regenerated with Christ as our life and taught in Him, learn from Him as the truth is in Jesus
As grace and truth are the basic elements in Ephesians 4:17-32, so love and light are the basic elements in 5:1-33
After we have, in the Lord Jesus, received God as grace and realize Him as truth, we come to Him and enjoy His love and light
In 4:32 Paul presents God as the pattern for our daily walk, and in 5:2 he sets forth Christ as the example for our living
In Ephesians 5:8 Paul goes on to say, 'You were once darkness, but now light in the Lord; walk as children of light'
It is significant that in speaking of the fruit of the light Paul mentions only three things: goodness, righteousness, and truth
The reason he mentions just three things is that the fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God
The Father as the goodness the Son as the righteousness and the Spirit as the truth the reality are all related to the fruit of the light
Love is the inner substance of God that can be sensed, and light is the expressed element of God that can be seen
Sometimes just by singing we cannot express what is in us to the Lord; we need psalming to pour out our praise to the Lord adequately
In 5:20 Paul goes on to say, 'Giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father'
We should give thanks to God the Father not only at good times but at bad times, and not only for good things but for all things
A normal Christian life should be one that is filled with the Word that the Spirit may bubble from within in lauding melodies
Doing all things in the name of the Lord Jesus is related to letting the word of Christ saturate us and permeate us
Because the Lord has saturated us, permeated us, and mingled Himself with us, making us one with Him, we can do all things in His name
We did not even exercise our emotion adequately to love the Word, or exercise our will strongly to receive the Word
If we exercise our whole being to take in the Word, eventually we shall be filled, occupied, and saturated with the living Word
Our subjection should be one to another, not only the younger ones to the older ones but also the older ones to the younger ones
When we speak, sing, psalm, and give thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we are willing to submit ourselves to one another
If we are not filled, there will be no speaking, singing, psalming, or thanking God, and consequently there will be no submitting
The proper church people are those who are submissive by speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God from their inner being
We see this in Colossians 3:18-4:1, a sister passage to Ephesians 5:22-6:9, regarding the believers' ethical relationships
In Ephesians the emphasis is on the need of spirit-filled ethical relationships for the expression of the Body in the normal church life
If we live in union with Christ, allowing the word of Christ to saturate us, Christ will be expressed through our humanity
The relationship between wives and husbands is connected to the matter of being filled in spirit and saturated with the word of Christ
As Christ is the Head of the church and the Savior of the Body, wives must be subject to their husbands as to the Lord
Ephesians 5:23 says, 'For a husband is head of the wife as also Christ is Head of the church, being Himself the Savior of the Body'
In verse 24 Paul continues, 'As the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives to their husbands in everything'
Ephesians 5:25 says, 'Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her'
Verse 29 continues, 'For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church'
Just as we eat for the sake of our body, so husbands need to take in something of the Lord for the sake of their wives
The promise, mentioned in verse 3, is that it may be well with the children and that they may live long on the earth
The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessings; it also refers to living in a peaceful situation
According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God's blessings in this life to those who honor their parents
Ephesians 6:4 says, 'The fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord'
Of provoking the children to anger, the fathers are to nurture them in the discipline and admonition of the Lord
Raising children requires that the parents give them the needed instruction related to human life, family life, and social life
Paul was probably referring to the Old Testament requirement that parents instruct their children with the word of God
In Ephesians 65 Paul says The slaves obey your masters according to flesh with fear and trembling in singleness of your heart as to Christ
In Colossians 4:1 Paul says, 'The masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven'
