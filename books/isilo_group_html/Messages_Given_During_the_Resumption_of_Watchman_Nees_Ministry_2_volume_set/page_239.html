At that time we did not have the freedom to preach the gospel, and we prayed that if You were to have mercy on us and would give us another opportunity, we would surely preach the gospel properly. Now that problem is gone, and another problem is coming. The condition this time may even be worse than the last time. At that time, we could still meet and serve individually. But if this problem comes, we will not even be able to meet anymore. You have charged us to pray for those who are over us and who are in authority, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life. Now we cannot lead a tranquil life. We pray that the Lord would give the church peace. Lord, we ask You to give us another chance. No matter how much time we will have this time, we will sacrifice everything to preach the gospel. This is the church's prayer. At least, this is a prayer in one accord. We may not be in one accord in a thousand other things, but concerning this, we are in one accord. Although some may kill Stephen, You can still say to the Saul who fell on the ground, "It is hard for you to kick against the goads." May the Lord hear our prayer.</P><P>Brother Witness Lee and Brother Chu Cheng laid hands on Brother Chang Hsing-rong, who was about to return to Manila via Taiwan, and prayed for him: Lord, here is a person whose heart has been gained by You. May that which You have gained in him be expressed out from him. May the Lord grant him peace, and bless all the works that are related to him, so that he can spread abroad what he has received here. May the Lord accomplish this work soon.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_238.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_240.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 239</div><br></body></html>
