   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is another thing that the Holy Spirit does and this concerns the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people do not see the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, they do not treasure the words of the Bible that much.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can man receive the work of the Lord's cross?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many are bewildered about this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many sinners even pray, "Lord Jesus, be merciful to me and die for me."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They do not know what redemption is at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here we see the preciousness of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After God has accomplished His work through His Son, He declares it to us and shows us through the words of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, God has placed the grace that the Lord accomplished for us in His own Word and has sent this Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we subtracted the work of the Lord Jesus from the Word of God, what would we have?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we took away the work of the Lord Jesus from the Word of God, God's Word would become zero; nothing would be left.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason that God's Word is God's Word is that in it there is the fact of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is a word?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A word is a recorded fact.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without facts, words become lies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the facts, the words become real.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Lord's work for us is not real, the Word of God is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But if the work of the Lord Jesus is a fact, if God has accomplished His righteousness through the Lord Jesus, and if God has accepted us in the Lord Jesus, God's Word must be trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, we have to remember that the work of the Lord Jesus is contained in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Holy Spirit is the doorkeeper of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I like my English name, Watchman.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It means one that guards and keeps watch.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has put the accomplished work of the Lord in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the Holy Spirit is carefully watching.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is like a doorkeeper.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As soon as a person receives the Lord, immediately He opens up the matters in God's Word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A few days ago a brother sent me a box of candy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The box was very big and had flowers printed on it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was wrapped in peach-colored paper with a letter attached, saying that the candy was a gift for me.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can say that what I received was a paper box.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I did not receive the candy itself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I did not even taste the candy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What was in my hand was a paper box.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But what I had actually received was the candy because the candy was in the box.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What I took home was the box.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But at the same time, I took the candy that came with the box.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we receive today is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But what we receive into us is the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we receive the Word of God, we get the work of the Lord, for the Lord's work is in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When one believes today, he is not believing that the Lord has done something for him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is believing in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when one believes in the Word of God, the Lord's work is automatically applied to him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, if you say that you are not very smart and that you cannot understand the work of the Lord, I will say to you that God does not require you to believe in the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He only requires you to believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you believe in God's Word, you will obtain His work in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Apparently, what I took home was the paper box.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How do I know that it contained candy?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When I went home, I removed the colored paper and opened the box and took out the candy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is how the Holy Spirit works.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We receive God's Word by faith, and the Holy Spirit opens up the work of the Lord that is contained in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we must realize that the work of the Holy Spirit is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Holy Spirit conveys the work of the Lord contained in God's Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without the Holy Spirit's conveying, God's Word remains only the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But when the Holy Spirit comes, the Word is opened up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, God has prepared the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He has also prepared the Holy Spirit for this work of fellowship.</S>
