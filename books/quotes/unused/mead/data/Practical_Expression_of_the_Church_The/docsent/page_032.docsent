   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN ABSOLUTENESS FOR THE LOCAL CHURCH Scripture reading: Romans 16:3-16; 1 Corinthians 16:19; Colossians 4:15-16; Philemon 1-2 THE CHURCH IN THE HOME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order that we may be definitely clear concerning the local church i.e., one church in one city , we must see the matter of the church in the home.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may think that it is possible to have the church in the city and at the same time a church in the home.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament epistles, only four homes are mentioned in which there were churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In two of these places, it is the home of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first is in Romans 16:5, "Likewise greet the church that is in their house."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At this time, they were living in Rome, and the church in Rome was meeting in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, the church in Rome could be called the church in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In fact, today in Sacramento, the church in Sacramento meets in the home of a certain brother.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So we could say that there is a church in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then in Romans 16:10-11, two more houses are mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But both of these verses do not mention a church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 16:14 says, "the brethren which are with them."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have the brethren, but it does not say that it was a church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And Romans 16:15 mentions, "all the saints which are with them."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it also does not say that that was the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is just like the place that we call the Magnolia House, that we use today in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So many saints are living there, but we cannot say that is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time in Rome, there was only one house where there was a church, and that was the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must realize that the church in the home must be equal to the church in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There were not two churches in Rome, one called the church in Rome and another which met in the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church in Rome simply met in the house of this couple; so there was a church in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then 1 Corinthians 16:19 says, "The churches of Asia salute you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This again is the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now this couple has moved from Rome to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Acts 18:18-19 tells us this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>So the church in Ephesus was meeting in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Wherever they were, this couple was so willing to have the meeting of the church in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Acts 18, we see that Aquila and Priscilla traveled with the Apostle Paul from Rome to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But after Paul left Ephesus, they remained there, and the church in Ephesus met in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why the Apostle Paul mentioned the church in their house.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Another church meeting in a home is mentioned in Colossians 4:15-16.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 15 says, " the church which is in his house."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the house of Nymphas.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we read these verses carefully, we will see that the church in the house of Nymphas was the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 16 says, "And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church in the house of Nymphas was the church in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This does not mean that there was a church in Laodicea and another church in the house of Nymphas.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Revelation 3:14, the church in Laodicea is mentioned as the only church in that city.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the strongest proof that there were not two churches in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There was only one church in this city, and that church was meeting in the house of Nymphas.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now let us read Philemon 1-2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer, and to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and the church in thy house."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To understand these two verses regarding the church in the house of Philemon, we must read Colossians 4:9, 17: "With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Philemon verse 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it" cf.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Philemon verse 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These two verses prove that Philemon lived in Colosse.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church in Colosse was meeting in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church in his house was the church in Colosse.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church in Rome was in the home of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And the church in Ephesus was also in the house of Aquila and Priscilla.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the church in Laodicea was in the house of Nymphas, and the church in Colosse was in the house of Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are the four instances of a church meeting in a home in the New Testament.</S>
