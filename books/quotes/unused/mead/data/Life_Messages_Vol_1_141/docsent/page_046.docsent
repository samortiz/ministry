   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW WE MEET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our meetings must be a show window of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's economy ordains that we should live, grow, and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We live this way, so we meet this way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need to discuss what kind of meeting to have.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This matter is resolved in our daily life in our married life, in our business life, and in our school life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we do not live Christ in our personal, private lives, how can we release Him in the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even if the attempt to release our spirit is sincere, the meeting still is only a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fruit-bearing of the branches is not a labor but the outflow of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our preaching of the gospel must be our living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Living this way will attract the best people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have put forth much effort, yet our fruit-bearing has been meager; this indicates there has not been much living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A FALSE LIBERTY</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These past few months I have been deeply concerned about the course of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord has troubled and burdened me that its nature has been changed from life to activities, concepts, and arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the sake of the Lord's recovery, we must drop our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not be distracted by any concept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you not realize that you sacrifice the oneness by supporting your concept?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You say the meetings are boring.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You say that to attend all the meetings is religious.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You say that you can enjoy the Lord at the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I ask you, is the family not your family whether it is good or bad?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Which do you think you will regret in the age to come attending boring meetings or not attending the meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Have you ever received grace by staying away from the meetings, by going to the beach, by watching television, or by engaging in sports?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do drop all such damaging concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A number of times when the meetings were low and I had no heart to go, I went anyway because I make it a point to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In my whole church life there are very few meetings I have missed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In those low meetings especially, I have often received the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TAKING IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nothing honors our Father more than when we take His Word and keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Bible is the Word of our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose you receive a letter from your mother.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you come to read it, you have the sense that you are coming to her.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In a similar way, when you come to the Bible, you have the sweet consciousness that you are coming to your God, your Father, your Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, if you take in the Word, you get the reality of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the Spirit who dwells in you is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>TOUCHING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Within us there is an inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we take care of this when we are praying over the Word, we are touching the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, if the sense comes that we are wrong or mistaken in a certain matter, we must confess and be cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then there may be a consciousness of something else; take care of that.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Don't argue; just take care of the inner consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To take the Word and to touch the Spirit in this way is to abide in the vine and to enjoy all the riches of the Triune God as your portion.</S>
