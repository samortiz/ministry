<p>Since we published <em>The Kingdom of the Heavens</em> in 1936 and <em>The Truth concerning the Kingdom of the Heavens</em> in 1939 and 1940, the children of God in many places have received much help. We thank God for this. However, we have also faced continual opposition. Because of this opposition, we must be willing to carefully examine the question of the kingdom of the heavens before God. We truly must be in fear and trembling concerning misinterpreting the Word of God. However, after passing through more than twenty years of opposition, during which time we have carefully studied and considered the Word, the light of this truth is even clearer to us, and we are even more convinced that our study accurately reflects God&rsquo;s Word. As we were revising these messages, we felt even stronger and more assured of this truth. The truth does not fear investigation by opposers, just as pure gold does not fear trial by fire. If this is the truth, the more it passes through the examination of opposition, the more it will be manifested as the truth.</p>
<p>Although it is the truth, we do not want to argue. While a proper explanation concerning this truth is necessary, such an explanation is not for the purpose of arguing. Yet because of opposition and criticism, we carefully considered whether or not God wanted us to speak on this. For example, when we were not able to complete this chapter on time because the editors did not have enough time to work on it, we had to consider whether or not God wanted us to publish this message. But after much deep consideration, we still felt that we should release this important truth of God and that we should not avoid mentioning this matter to the children of God simply because some strongly oppose it. We also realized that releasing this truth again would make it difficult to avoid even more and even stronger opposition. But we believe all this opposition will serve only to make the truth clearer. Our only hope is that regardless of whether we are expounding the truth or opposing a false teaching, our hearts would be pure and our words would be proper. Brothers, it is a very serious matter to expound the truth! We are responsible to God not only for the content of what we say, but also for the motives behind what we say and for the words that we use in our speaking. God will judge us before His judgment seat concerning all these things. May we fear Him and not consider it as a small matter before Him. God have mercy on us.</p>
<p>We have no desire to dispute many of the arguments of those who oppose. We feel we should simply release the truth. However, there are two points we would like to clarify for the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>1. Some say that because we teach the discipline of the kingdom of the heavens, we are teaching concerning purgatory. Many friends, especially those from the West, are very concerned for us with respect to this matter. For many years our friends have frequently asked us about this point. Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to clarify this matter.</p>
<p>Purgatory is one of the great heresies taught by the Roman Catholic Church. They erroneously use the word in 1 Corinthians 3:13 and 15 to say that if a person sins while he is living, he will go to the fires of purgatory after his death to be purified and thus be a soul in purgatory. His living relatives must then say prayers for his soul in purgatory to gain merit on his behalf and reduce the number of years he suffers in purgatory. This teaching is a great heresy! In 1 Corinthians 3:13 and 15 the testing by fire that is spoken of does not occur after a believer dies but takes place in the day of the Lord&rsquo;s return. This fire also does not purge dead believers but rather causes the Lord&rsquo;s servants to suffer loss or punishment when they are judged by the Lord when He returns. Finally, this testing fire cannot be averted or reduced by the prayers or by the merit of family and friends. The thought of using prayers and family merit to shorten the suffering of a soul in purgatory is actually a Buddhist concept, and it is completely satanic. Therefore, this is a great heresy!</p>
<p>In the preceding chapter we saw that the discipline of the kingdom referred to in the Bible occurs when the Lord returns and that believers are punished during the kingdom of the heavens. When a believer dies today, his spirit and soul go to rest and wait in Paradise. They will not be resurrected until the Lord returns, and then the believers will stand before the judgment seat of Christ to be judged according to what they have done and receive recompense for good or for evil. After they pass through this judgment, they will be given a reward or a punishment, depending on the result of the judgment, during the age of the kingdom of the heavens. What the Bible says concerning discipline related to the kingdom of the heavens is absolutely different from what the Roman Catholic Church teaches about purgatory.</p>
<p>2. Some who oppose the truth about the kingdom of the heavens say that the kingdom of the heavens is for the Jews, not for the church. In particular, they say that the teachings about the kingdom of the heavens in the Gospel of Matthew are for Jews, not for us believers. In their view they do not have to keep any of the teachings in Matthew regarding the kingdom of the heavens because believers never enter the kingdom of the heavens. However, we can readily see that this kind of speaking is wrong. The kingdom of the heavens spoken of in Matthew is the kingdom of God spoken of in Mark and Luke. The same parable that refers to the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 13:31 is used to refer to the kingdom of God in Mark 4:30-32. Likewise, the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens in Matthew 13:11 are referred to as the mysteries of the kingdom of God in Luke 8:10. These portions are sufficient proof that the kingdom of the heavens spoken of in Matthew is the kingdom of God in Mark and Luke, and that this kingdom of God is the same kingdom that John in his Gospel says we must enter by being born again (3:3, 5). Moreover, after the Lord resurrected, He spoke to the disciples about the kingdom of God (Acts 1:3). After the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the apostles preached the gospel of the kingdom of God in every place (8:12); the apostles also wanted the Gentile churches to pursue an entrance into this very kingdom of God (14:22). Later, in his Epistles Paul told the churches in the Gentile lands to take heed to pursue the kingdom of God (Rom. 14:17; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; 15:50; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5; 2 Thes. 1:5). Finally, Revelation prophesies that the kingdom of God will come to the earth (11:15; 12:10).</p>
<p>After seeing these things in a general way, we realize that it makes no sense to say that the kingdom of the heavens is only for the Jews and not for the church or that the teachings about the kingdom of the heavens were given to the Jews and not to the believers. If the kingdom of the heavens is only for the Jews, the kingdom of God should also be only for the Jews. If the teachings concerning the kingdom of the heavens are only for the Jews, the teachings concerning the kingdom of God should also be only for the Jews. If this were the case, what teachings would be left for the believers? This is too illogical. Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, the kingdom of the heavens in the Bible is for the believers. It is something we should pursue in order to enter. All the teachings concerning the kingdom of the heavens in the Bible are for the believers, and we should pay attention to all of them.</p>
<p>Now we are again releasing this message and placing it before all the children of God. We hope that all God&rsquo;s children would seriously investigate this matter according to His Word and be like the Bereans (Acts 17:11). If this is God&rsquo;s truth, we hope that our brothers will receive it; if it is shown to be a human speaking, we will gladly set it aside. We are willing to receive correction from our brothers concerning any truth.</p>
<p>We also ask the brothers and sisters who have received this truth to not debate with others simply because they understand this matter. Our understanding of the truth is for our living, not for debating with others. We should use the truth to help others in the matter of life; we should not use the truth to debate with others about doctrines. People sometimes do not receive a certain truth because they do not have a sufficient level of life, not because they do not have enough knowledge of truth. If we help others to grow in life and to receive the truths that help them to grow in life, this is sufficient. May God give us grace.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 5 &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
