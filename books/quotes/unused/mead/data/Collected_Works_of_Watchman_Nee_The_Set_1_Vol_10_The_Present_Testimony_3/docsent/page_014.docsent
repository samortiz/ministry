   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRESSURES AND TRIALS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This issue was completed in the midst of much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I know that Satan and his evil spirits are very busy, for he is aware that the message of The Present Testimony is harmful to him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, both the message and the one who preaches it are the objects of his attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason I beg all the brothers in the Lord to supply me with more prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The various temptations, oppressions, misunderstandings, and hardships which come can weaken even the physically strongest one, to say nothing of someone like me whose earthly tabernacle is often being shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is difficult to become a martyr, but it is also difficult to become an apostate.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To restrain our lips is indeed painful, but to vindicate ourselves does not bring joy either.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>An evil name brings sorrow, but a good name does not necessarily bring gladness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We care only to work faithfully, keeping the first love and maintaining a single eye while waiting for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Did not the Lord tell us from the outset that we must bear the cross and encounter sufferings on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Watchman</S>
