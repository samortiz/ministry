<h2 class="head1">GRADUALLY BEING REVIVED</h2><p>There are meetings three times a day in Kuling Mountain (with the exception of prayer on the Lord's Day morning and rest on Wednesday). There are two meetings in the morning. The first is a basic training for the ministry of the word. Messages have been given on submission to authority and the exercise of the spirit, emphasizing the separation of the inner man and the outer man. The second meeting is for individual judgments. Only one person is allowed to testify in each meeting, and then his problems are discussed after his testimony. It seems to be a practical training in the judgment in the house of God. The evening meeting is for the preparation of the edification of new believers.</p><p>Since coming to the mountain, my spirit has been gradually revived before God, and recently I have been moving gradually upward. (From the meeting in Shanghai all the way to Foochow, my entire being was prostrate before God as if I were paralyzed. I had no feeling or strength. It is really marvelous. Praise the Lord!) I hope I will not need to struggle in dealing with the negative things again, but can be strengthened in the positive things. If you have anything to say to me, I am willing to receive the help.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Lee Yin-hsin<br />July 7, 1948</p><h2 class="head1">A FINAL LETTER FROM THE EDITOR</h2><p>Four publications&mdash;The Ministers, The Gospel, The Way, and The Present Testimony&mdash;have all been published on time. Although they are all bimonthly magazines, we must publish one publication every half month. Therefore, every department is very busy. We would like to answer some subscribers' questions and ask you to attend to a few points:</p><p>1)News of Believers will be discontinued with the eighth issue. The Present Testimony will continue after News of Believers. Its contents will be more specific than that of News of Believers. Subscribers to News of Believers will receive at least one copy of The Present Testimony from us. Whoever would like to continue to subscribe should fill out the subscription form and send it to us. If you do not notify us, we will discontinue your subscription in the following issue. (Please read the back cover of that publication to find out how to subscribe.)</p><p>2)Because of too many subscribers from the localities, we have no more copies of Issue No. 1 of The Gospel. From now on, those who subscribe to this publication will receive copies beginning with the second issue. This paper is very expensive. (It costs one hundred million yen to typeset one hymn with music and to have one picture on the front.) We hope that when you give copies to people, you will not just scatter them like tracts but will give some consideration to whom you are giving them to.</p><p>3)Some readers subscribe for others. It is best to give this information to your friends personally. Forgive us for not notifying them for you. Furthermore, it would be best if you would mail your personal letters directly to your correspondents in Shanghai (other than those who are working in the Gospel Book Room). Please forgive us for not being able to verify information or conduct business on your behalf.</p><p>4)When filling out a subscription order: a) Be sure to write legibly. b) Subscribers from other provinces must give us the name of their province and city or county so that we may prepare cards and labels. c) When subscribing to several publications, it is important to use the same name and address for each subscription because we file subscriptions according to a person's last name.</p><p>5)When changing your address or the number of copies in your subscription, it would be best to send us the paper wrapper from your subscription which contains your name, address, and quantity on it. At the very least, include your previous address. This will reduce the amount of time we have to spend in looking for your record. Please remember this. This will save us some trouble.</p><p>6)Although there are temporary prices for the three publications&mdash;The Ministers, The Way, and The Present Testimony&mdash;in reality we have only charged enough to cover the postage for The Ministers. (The price of sending one paper is now at least ten thousand yen.) While we were editing and typesetting the first issue of The Ministers, one roll of white newsprint cost almost five million yen. The price for one roll has now increased more than tenfold. The other costs, including typesetting and printing, have also risen with the rise of the cost of living and have increased more than tenfold. Our most recent cost was more than ten thousand yen for typesetting one word. You can imagine the rest of the costs. But thank God, through the offerings of many brothers and sisters, He has allowed us to put out these publications on time. We are sharing this so that you can thank God with us for the publications that have already been put out, and so that you will know how heavy our burden is in order to pray for us.</p><p>7)Although certain places can receive letters and wired money, the post office may not accept printed materials. Sometimes we send the materials by airmail. Even though we are willing to spend the money, sometimes it is not even accepted as airmail. We are now trying to find people who will go to these places to carry the publications with them. We hope that the churches in the far regions like the Northwest would also be able to receive these four publications.</p><p>8)We are unable to calculate foreign postage and domestic airmail postage because we have only a few workers (who are all very busy) and because the postage rates increase unexpectedly. (At present it costs more than 300,000 yen to send one magazine by domestic airmail.) We can only ask our readers to calculate the postage costs from the stamps on the publications when they receive them.</p><p>We hope to serve all the local churches well in the matter of the publications. It is difficult, however, to avoid errors because we are so busy. If we forget something, please tell us so that we may correct the error. May the Lord bless every reader.</p><p>The Shipping Department<br />Shanghai Gospel Book Room<br />August 17, 1948</p><p>(The monetary system changed while we were proofreading this copy. We are now charging by the "gold yen." If anyone has a need but is unable to pay the cost, we are still willing to consider giving the publications free of charge.)</p>
