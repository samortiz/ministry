   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Grace That Was to Come</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>unto the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Peter 1:10 speaks of the grace that was to come unto the believers, which was prophesied by the prophets, who sought and searched diligently concerning the salvation of the believers souls.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The grace mentioned by Peter here is different from the grace mentioned in John 1.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John said that the Word became flesh, full of grace, and that grace came through Jesus Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Grace came through Jesus Christ, with Jesus incarnation, but Peter said that there is a grace which is not yet but is to come.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This grace was not mentioned in the Old Testament, but it was prophesied by the prophets who sought and searched diligently concerning the salvation of the believers souls 1 Pet 1:9 , not the salvation of their bodies or spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our souls need to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today s theological schools do not teach concerning the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows the shortage in the theology of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Christianity the top theology is that of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the theology adopted by Dallas Theological Seminary and based on the teachings of C. I. Scofield.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Scofield Reference Bible was written according to the Brethren teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are also the Reformed theology of John Calvin and other theologies, but all these theologies are short of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This shortage is also evident in the Nicene Creed, which is adhered to by both the Catholic Church and many of the Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the Lord s Day, many in Christianity still recite the Nicene Creed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is perfect and we agree with it, but it is incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are at least six crucial points which the Nicene Creed does not mention.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 John 7:39 says, The Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No theology in Christianity covers this point.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They do not know what this means.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 First Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Christianity s traditional teaching of the Triune God, the three of the Triune God are separate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you say that Christ, the Son in the flesh, became the life-giving Spirit, they feel that you are mixing up the Son with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, their teaching of the Trinity is tritheistic.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They do not admit that they believe in three Gods, but unconsciously they teach three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To them the Son is one God, the Spirit is one God, and the Father is one God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some have said that the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45b is not the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if this were the case, there must be another Spirit besides the Holy Spirit which gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3 Second Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit, and verse 18 speaks of the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord and the Spirit are one, but the traditional teaching says that the Son, who is the Lord, is separate from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in 2 Corinthians 3:18 there is the compound divine title the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>4 Philippians 1:19 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>5 Revelation 1:4; 4:5; and 5:6 speak of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>6 Exodus 30 reveals the compound Spirit typified by the holy anointing ointment vv.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>23-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This ointment is compounded with olive oil and four spices.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Who knows the significance of these five elements?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The above six points are not taught or understood in today s Christianity, so the Nicene Creed is perfect but incomplete.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am saying this here because when we speak on the crystallization of the grace of God, we are also exposing the shortage of today s theology.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter spoke of the grace which was for the salvation of the believers souls.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What Peter teaches as grace is not the grace that saves our spirit or our body, but the grace that saves our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus said, What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Mark 8:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A man can gain the whole world and lose his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This shows that the soul needs to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If, for the sake of saving your soul, you sacrifice the whole world, that is worthwhile.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>21.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Grace on Which the Believers Set</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Their Hope Perfectly and Which Will Be Brought</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>to the Believers at the Revelation of Jesus Christ</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First Peter 1:13 speaks of the grace on which the believers set their hope perfectly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nearly every day, I pray that my soul will be saved at the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Matthew 25 the Lord speaks of different types of servants.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Lord comes back, He will tell some that they are slothful slaves, and they will be cast into the outer darkness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>24-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is to lose the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord will tell others that they are good and faithful slaves, and they will enter into the joy of their Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>20-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is the saving of the soul in the next age for those who enter into the enjoyment of the Lord to feast with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This grace will come by the revelation of the Lord Jesus at His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It was studied by the prophets in the Old Testament and is hoped for by us, the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Thank the Lord for such a grace.</S>
