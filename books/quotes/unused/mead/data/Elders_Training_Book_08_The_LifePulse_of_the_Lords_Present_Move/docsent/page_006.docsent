   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO HOME GATHERING 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 2:46; 5:42; Rom 16:5a; 1 Cor 16:19b; Col 4:15; Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, we need You in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Cleanse us with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We trust in this cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lord, we do not have any trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Give us the rich anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, give us an open heaven that we may see what is on Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, in this matter of home gatherings, we need Your revelation; we need Your enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not like to follow the old, traditional way of any meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, be with us and give us the instant utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, give us the real understanding and real seeing, the inward seeing, that we may have the vision concerning Your way for us to meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, chase away all the darkness among us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We like to be under a clear sky, seeing the things You like to have us see.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, do cover us again with Your prevailing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this chapter we come to the very practical matter of the home gatherings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the New Testament there are not many verses that talk about the way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In today s Christianity the understanding of Christian meetings is almost entirely based upon the natural concept.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would ask you to drop all those concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I was greatly frustrated for many years by these concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even after coming into the Lord s recovery, that kind of traditional frustration was still with me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE WAY OF MEETING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND THE NEW WAY OF HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There was a certain way for the children of Israel to be gathered in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Acts 7 they are referred to as the assembly in the wilderness v. 38 . The King James Version uses the word church instead of assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There was a certain kind of meeting with the people of God in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They came together three times a year to meet around and within the temple Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then on the day of Pentecost, a new thing began.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The one hundred and twenty met in an upper room Acts 1:13, 15 , but they suddenly had three thousand added to them Acts 2:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They immediately began to meet in the temple 2:46 , but that way of meeting was according to their tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Note 46 1 in Acts 2 Recovery Version says:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the initiation of God s New Testament economy, the early believers and even the first group of apostles were not clear that God had forsaken Judaism with its practices and facilities including the temple Matt 23:38 your house, referring to the God-forsaken temple .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, they still went, according to their tradition and habit, to the temple for their New Testament meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In referring to the temple in Matthew 23:38 the Lord said, Behold, your house is left to you desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The temple was the house of God, but now the Lord called it your house because they had made it a den of robbers 21:13 and God had forsaken it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the disciples still went to the temple for their New Testament meeting according to their tradition and habit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although they were still under the influence of their tradition, they were so much under the power of the Spirit that they also met in their homes, even from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The way to meet from house to house was absolutely new.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament in Exodus 12, at the initiation of their exodus from Egypt, the Old Testament saints had the Passover in their homes since there was not a center for their worship by that time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every home with its household had a little home gathering to observe the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But when they entered into the good land, they had to keep the three annual feasts of the Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles at the worshipping center of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suddenly on the day of Pentecost under the power and leading of the Holy Spirit, they began to meet from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The three thousand who were added to the church on the day of Pentecost were all Jewish.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were either local residents or from different countries where they had been dispersed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many Jews from other countries came back to their fatherland to keep the feast of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When they were saved, they were all gathered by the Holy Spirit, so they began to meet in their homes, probably on the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have also considered how these three thousand were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How could one hundred twenty baptize three thousand?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Probably at least one-third of these one hundred twenty were sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From the very beginning the Holy Spirit led the new church to do everything by each member.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They all did the baptizing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It could not have been a baptism done in a concentrated way with a large gathering and one pastor and an assistant to do the baptizing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They probably did their baptizing in a very scattered way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Peter surely could not control the situation since all three thousand were new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These new ones did not have any training, they did not receive any instruction, and they gathered from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may ask who arranged their meetings, who assigned them, and were some leading ones and helpers appointed?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These questions are all our natural thought.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the day of Pentecost there was no time for them to do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Suddenly they met, they gathered from house to house.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In October of 1984 I went back to Taiwan and ran a risk to tell people that in all the home meetings there should not be any designated leader.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I told them to forget about the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I was so bold to tell them that even a sister or a little girl could be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then I went further to say that everybody could be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is superstitious to think that the Holy Spirit assigned a leader to each of the homes, pointing out certain ones to be the leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is no hint in the New Testament concerning this.</S>
