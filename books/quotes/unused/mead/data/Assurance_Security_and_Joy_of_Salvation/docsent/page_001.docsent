   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ASSURANCE, SECURITY, AND JOY OF SALVATION THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you recently have had the experience of receiving Christ, you may have had times when you doubted the reality of that experience; that is, you may have questioned whether you were really saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without the real assurance of salvation as a solid foundation, it is difficult for a new Christian to grow and experience the deeper things of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, the Bible says it is possible to know absolutely, unreservedly, that you are a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us read 1 John 5:13:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not, that you may think, not, that you may hope, but that you may know.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not need to wait until we die to find out; this assurance is for us to enjoy today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How can we have the assurance of salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are three means:</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God Says So</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our first means of assurance of salvation is God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>While man s word may be untrustworthy, God s Word remains sure and steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is impossible for God to lie Heb 6:18; Num 23:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whatever God says stands firm forever Psa 119:89 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What God has said is not a matter of conjecture.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His Word is neither vague nor intangible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It comes to us today in written form, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible is God s very Word, inspired by Him 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can take this Word, believe this Word, and trust this Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What then does God say about salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He says that the way of salvation is a person, Jesus Christ John 3:16; 14:6; Acts 10:43; 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He says that whoever believes that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He says that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Rom 10:9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have you done this?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you believed in Christ and confessed openly that He is your Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have you called on His name?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If so, you are really saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God says so.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That settles it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Holy Spirit Bears Witness</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only do we have God s Word outside us telling us we are saved, we also have a witness inside us, telling us the very same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What the Bible speaks to us from without, the Spirit confirms within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First John 5:10 says, He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes, after we have received Christ, we may not feel saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, if we check within the deepest part of our being, with our spirit, we will find a kind of inner witness, an assurance, that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you doubt that you have this inner witness of the Spirit, try this simple experiment: try declaring boldly, I am not a child of God!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You will find it very difficult to even whisper such a falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because the Holy Spirit within you bears witness, You are a child of God!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our Love for the Brothers Is Proof</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The third means of assurance is our love for other brothers and sisters in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First John 3:14 says, We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A saved person undoubtedly senses a kind of love for others who are also saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You sense a desire to fellowship, to enjoy Christ with others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the spontaneous result of being saved, one of the clearest signs of a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This love transcends the cheap, selfish love of today s age.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a love that is impartial it loves those who are alike and those who are different.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the real oneness and harmony the world longs for.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yet it is ours when we receive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Psa 133:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the testimony of a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>By these three witnesses God s Word, the Spirit s inner witness, and our love for the brothers we may know and be sure that we are really saved.</S>
