Knowing that He would be put to death the next day, during the evening He gave this message to His disciples. The message in these chapters may be considered the deepest revelation in the New Testament. After giving this message, the Lord Jesus offered the prayer to the Father recorded in chapter seventeen. Hence, chapter seventeen may be considered the concluding prayer of the message in chapters fourteen through sixteen. Later we shall see the content of this message.<p>I would remind you that the title of this series of messages is &#8220;The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John.&#8221; Many Christians do not realize that the writings of John, especially his Gospel, are the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament. Some may find this difficult to understand. After much deep study, we have come to realize the fact that the tabernacle and the offerings in the Old Testament are fulfilled in the writings of John.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S DWELLING PLACE</h2><p>We need to see the significance of the tabernacle and all the offerings. The tabernacle is God&#8217;s dwelling place on earth among His people. This is a great matter. The tabernacle as God&#8217;s dwelling place among His people on earth is actually the center and reality of the entire universe. We may say that the universe, which is composed of the heavens, the earth, and billions of items, is a huge container. What does the universe contain? Of course, the universe contains God. However, God wants His redeemed people to be His dwelling place in the universe. The universe contains God&#8217;s people, and God&#8217;s people are His dwelling place. Therefore, God&#8217;s dwelling place is the center and reality of the universe.<p>Suppose in this universe there was no such thing as a collective people; that is, there was no such thing as those who are God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. If this were the situation, there would be no dwelling place of God in the universe. Without God&#8217;s people as His dwelling place, the universe would be empty and vain, without a center and without reality. Therefore, we need to see that the center and reality of the universe is God&#8217;s dwelling place among His people.<h2 class=head1>A MUTUAL ABODE</h2><p>The tabernacle as God&#8217;s dwelling place is actually a mutual dwelling place, a mutual abode. This abode is God&#8217;s dwelling and also the dwelling of God&#8217;s serving ones. Eventually, God dwells in His people, and His people dwell in Him. This means there is a mutual dwelling in a mutual dwelling place. Such a wonderful dwelling place is the center and reality of the entire universe.<p>This wonderful dwelling place is not only the center and reality of the universe; it is also the center and reality of the Bible. What is the center and reality of the Old Testament? It is the tabernacle, God&#8217;s dwelling place. What is the center and reality of the New Testament? It is God&#8217;s house, God&#8217;s habitation. The whole Bible is a history of God&#8217;s dwelling place. This matter is crucial.<p>Another crucial matter concerns what is revealed in the Gospel of John. The Gospel of John reveals the Triune God dispensing Himself into His people and thereby making them His dwelling place. Eventually, God&#8217;s dwelling place also becomes the dwelling place of God&#8217;s people. Hence, it is a mutual dwelling place or mutual abode. John 15:4 says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; This can also be translated, &#8220;Dwell in Me and I in you.&#8221; In this verse we see the mutual dwelling. Since there is a mutual dwelling, there must certainly be a mutual abode. This mutual abode is the center and reality of the Gospel of John.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_130.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_132.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 131</div><br></body></html>
