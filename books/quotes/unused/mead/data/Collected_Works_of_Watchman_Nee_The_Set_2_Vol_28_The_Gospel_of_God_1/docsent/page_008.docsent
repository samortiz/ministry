   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THREE ASPECTS OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows us that there are three aspects of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To put it another way, sin is in three places.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, sin is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second, sin is in the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Third, sin is in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible always shows us sin according to these three lines.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is like one river that is fed by three tributaries.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we want to know sin in a thorough way, we must be clear about these three lines.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must know that our sin is before God, in the conscience, and in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not clear about these three lines and are not able to distinguish between them, we will not be clear concerning the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we confuse the three lines, we will not realize God's view concerning sin, and we will not comprehend the thoroughness of God's work in dealing with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only when we understand the need will we acknowledge the treatment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not know the need, we will assume that the treatment is unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we must know sin first, and then we can know the thoroughness of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God is a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the administration of the universe He is the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the Ruler of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has definite laws and ordinances concerning sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He rewards man according to what man has done, and He recompenses according to how man has acted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God deals with the world in His position as the sovereign Ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At the time of Adam, though there was no such term for it, there was the Adamic law.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After Noah, again though there was no such term for it, there was the Noachian law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the time of Moses, the term law specifically began to be used.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was not until then that the law was specifically placed before man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether we are talking about the explicit law after the time of Moses or about the implicit law before the time of Moses, God's verdict is that those who sin must die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He demands that those who transgress against the law will be punished with eternal death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>While man is alive, though his flesh is living, his spirit is dying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the end, his flesh will also die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In eternity, his spirit, soul, and body will all die.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If man does not sin, God will not execute the punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if man does sin, God will surely execute the punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God has enacted ordinances and laws concerning man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When sins occur in our life, there is first the record of sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let me illustrate with an example.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Recently people were forbidden to park their cars anywhere they pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Two months ago you could park your car anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You could even park your car on the wrong side of the street, and you were free to park your car in any direction.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But two months ago the traffic department ruled out this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now as you drive, you see all the cars parked in the same direction.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is a new law that says that all cars should be parked in the same direction as the flow of traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you do not do this, you violate the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If a brother comes to the meeting today by car and parks in the wrong direction, an officer from the police department may see this and record a violation against him at the police department.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The violation is recorded not in the street where he parked, but in the police department, even though the brother may not be aware of the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The violation may have happened on Ha-tung Road, but the place where the violation is recorded is the Tsin-an-tsu district police department.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The incidents of sin occur in man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But as soon as man sins, there is the record of it before God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is the sovereign Ruler of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He is in control of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If in the course of our lives we have transgressed the law, there is a record of our sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why the Old Testament frequently speaks of sinning against Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reason an act of sin is evil and terrifying is that once a sin is committed, there is the record of sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since God says that he who sins must die, He has to execute His judgment on sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no way for us to escape, for the record of sin is there already.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Second, there is the knowledge of the sin in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Though there is a record of the sin before God, until you know about it, you may still be able to smile and rejoice in your seat, and you may be able to act as if nothing has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But once you have the knowledge of a sin, the sin that is before God has come into your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Originally, this sin was only before God; now it is identified in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What is the conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is a "window."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God's light shines into you through the window of your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whenever God's light shines into you, you feel uncomfortable and you know that you have done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There may be someone here tonight who has parked his car in the wrong direction.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Perhaps he was not aware of his mistake and may have been quite unconcerned.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But since I have mentioned it, he will now feel uneasy within.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>My words have moved the record of his sin from the police department into him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, the conscience is turned by knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Without knowledge, you are ignorant of your sins; and since your conscience does not bother you, you will feel peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But as soon as you have the knowledge and begin to realize God's view and the view of the law concerning you, your conscience will not let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Is it true that everyone has a conscience?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Surely everyone has a conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But some consciences are closed up and light cannot get in. Some consciences are like a kitchen window that has a thick layer of grime on it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Through it you may be able to see the shadow of a man moving, but you cannot see the man clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If a person's conscience cannot take in God's light, he will be unconcerned and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But the moment he hears the gospel and sees his own sins, his place before God, and the record of his sins before God, his conscience has a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It will be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It will not be at peace, but will condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He will ask what he should do to be able to stand before the righteous God, and how he can become justified before such a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The amazing thing about the conscience is that it may at worst go to sleep, but it will never die.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Never think that the conscience has died.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It will never die, but it will go to sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, when the consciences of many wake up, they find that it is too late, that they do not have the opportunity anymore to believe or to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do not think that our conscience will let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>One day it will catch up with us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>One day it will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I have seen many who thought this way, who did much evil and thought that they would get by.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But when their conscience finally woke up, they were caught by it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What do people do when their conscience wakes up and they realize that they have sinned?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As soon as their conscience catches up with them, they try to do good by performing good works.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What is the purpose of man's trying to do good works?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The purpose is to bribe the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The conscience shows man that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>So now he performs more charitable acts and does more good deeds to tell his conscience that although he has done so much wrong, he has also done all these good things.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>What does it mean to do good works?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>To do good works means to bribe the conscience when it starts accusing, in order to quell its condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is a way of salvation invented by man.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But please remember that this is basically the wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Where is the basic error?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The error lies in our assumption that sin exists only in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We forget that sin also exists before God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If sin were only in our conscience, then we would need to perform at most ten good works to more than compensate for our one mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But the problem now is not with our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The problem now is what is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>I cannot be absolved from judgment for one violation of illegal parking just because I park the car legally a hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Sin is something before God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>It is not merely something in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Not only do we have to deal with the sin in our conscience; we also have to deal with our sin before God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Only when we have dealt with the record of sin before God can the sin in our conscience be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We cannot deal with the problem in the conscience first, for the conscience can be pacified by self-deception.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>But remember that the conscience will never die.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Perhaps you have not seen the conscience at work yet.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>I have often seen people who are troubled in their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When the light of God comes, the conscience is ill at ease.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>A person in such a condition would crawl into a hole in the floor if there were one.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He would do anything to pacify his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He would even forsake his life to redeem himself from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Why did Judas hang himself?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>It was because his conscience would not let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>He had betrayed Jesus, and his conscience would not let him go.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Why is there no need for God to send many angels to throw men into the lake of fire as though they were throwing stones?</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Why is there no need for God to have many angels guarding the lake of fire?</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Is not God afraid of a revolt in hell?</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I am sure that for a man who has sinned hell is a blessing rather than a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When the conscience rises up to condemn a man, it demands that the man be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Punishment is not just a demand of God, it is also a demand of man.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Before you see what sin is, you are afraid of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>But after you see what sin is, you will take punishment as a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Have you ever seen murderers or assassinators at the time of their execution?</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Before a man sees his sin, he may rejoice in murder.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>But after he sees his sin, he will rejoice in his own execution.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Hence, hell is not only a place of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>It is also a place of escape.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>It is the ultimate place of escape.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Sin in the conscience causes pain today and cries out for punishment in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Hence, for God to save us, He must deal with our sins before Him, and He must also deal with our sins in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>There is a third aspect to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Sin is not only before God and in man's conscience; sin is also in man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>This is what Romans 7 and 8 tell us.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>What is the sin in the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>We have seen that, on the one hand, there is the record of sins before God and that, on the other hand, there is the condemnation of sins in man's conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Now we see the third aspect: the power of sin and the activities of sin in man's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Sin has its place.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Sin is presiding.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>Sin is in man's flesh as the chairman.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Please remember that sin is the chairman presiding in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>What do I mean by this?</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Sins before God and in man's own conscience are objective.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>For me the record of sins before God and the condemnation of sins in my conscience are matters of my feeling with respect to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>But sin in the flesh is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>This means that the sin that is dwelling in me has the power to force me to sin; it has the power to incite and arouse me to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>This is what the Bible calls the sin in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>For example, there may be a brother who earns a hundred dollars a month, but spends a hundred and fifty dollars a month.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>He likes to borrow money.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>It is his disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>If he does not borrow, his hands will itch; even his head and his body will itch.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>After using up all of his salary, he must borrow some and spend it before he can feel comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>In him we can see the three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>First, he has many creditors, who have the records of his debts.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>Second, unless he has no knowledge of the consequences of borrowing, in which case he may still go on borrowing peacefully, he realizes that he is in danger and thus is burdened not only with the record of debt before his creditors, but also with the exposing by his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Yet in addition, there is the sin in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>He knows that it is wrong to borrow, yet he feels restless unless he continues to borrow.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Something is prompting him and arousing him, telling him that he has not borrowed for months and that he should do it one more time.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>This is the sin in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>On the one hand, sin is a fact with him; it results in a record of sin before God and sin in his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>On the other hand, sin is a power in his flesh; it incites and compels him, even drags and pulls him, to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>If you have never resisted sin, you have not felt its power.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>But if you try to resist sin, you will sense its power.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>When water is flowing, you do not feel its power if you flow along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>But if you try to go against the flow, you will feel its power.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Most rivers in China flow from the west to the east; so if you try to travel from the east to the west, you will feel how powerful China's rivers are.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Those who know the power of sin the most are those who are the holiest, for they are the ones who try to oppose and to stand against sin.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>If you are joined to sin and are going along with it, surely you will not know its power.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>The sin in your flesh is all the time arousing and compelling you to sin, but only when you wake up to deal with sin will you realize that you are a lost and perishing sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>Only then will you know that you are helpless and that you have no way to solve the problem of sin in your flesh, not to mention the presence of sins in your conscience and the record of sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>Therefore, we have to see that when God saves us, He deals with all three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>The inward sin is dealt with by the cross and the crucifixion of the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>We have mentioned this many times before, so we will not repeat it now.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>Our Bible study this time covers God's way of dealing with our sins before Him and the condemnation of sins in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>Earlier I mentioned the problem of sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>Sins refer to the sinful acts before God and in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>Every time the Bible mentions sins, it is referring to the sinful acts before God and in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>But every time the Bible mentions the sin in the flesh, it uses the word sin, not sins.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>If you remember this, you will have no trouble later on.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>We thank God that His salvation is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>He has dealt with our sins before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>He has also judged our sins in the person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>Furthermore, the Holy Spirit has applied Christ's work to us, so that we could receive the Lord Jesus and have peace in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>Once the conscience is cleansed, there is no more consciousness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>Many times I have heard Christians say that the blood of the Lord Jesus washes away their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>When I ask if they feel peaceful and happy, they say that at times they still feel the presence of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>This is inconceivable.</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>I am happy because when the conscience is cleansed, there is no more consciousness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>Our conscience has the consciousness of sins because there is the record of sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>But if the sins are gone before God, how can we still have the consciousness of them?</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>Since the sins before God have been dealt with, the sins in our conscience should be dealt with as well.</S>
   <S PAR='197' RSNT='1' SNO='197'>Hence, we should not have the consciousness of our sins any longer.</S>
