   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Loving Us and Having Released Us</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>from Our Sins by His Blood</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to Revelation 1:5, Christ, the Son of God, loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He loves us and has accomplished redemption for us by shedding His blood, which washes us and cleanses us from all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only the blood of Jesus Christ, whom God judged on the cross Isa 53:8 , is able to wash us from our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, Christ s blood is the unique redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only His blood can redeem us from all our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once we believe that the Lord died and shed His blood on the cross to make propitiation for sins, the Lord s blood causes God to forgive us of our sins and to spare us from the punishment of sin; it also washes away our sins and removes the filthiness of sin from us 1 John 1:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord shed His blood to redeem us from our sins, cleansing us and releasing us from them so that we no longer have the problem of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the troubles that come to us from our sins were resolved by the Lord s blood, which has released us from them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since the Lord s blood has released us from our sins, it also has released us from judgment, condemnation, wrath, and death, which are related to sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>e. Making Us a Kingdom,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Priests to His God and Father</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Revelation 1:6 says that the Son of God made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1 A Kingdom</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason God washed us in the precious blood of Christ was that we might be brought under His government.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The believers, who have been redeemed by the blood of Christ, not only have been born of God into His kingdom John 3:5 but also have been made a kingdom for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kingdom is the church Matt 16:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>John, the writer of Revelation, was in this kingdom Rev 1:9 , and all redeemed and reborn believers also are a part of this kingdom Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revelation 1 and 5 reveal that the Lord has purchased us by His blood to make us His kingdom 1:5-6; 5:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word translated kingdom in 1:6 and 5:10 implies the meaning of king.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Greek, as in English, king and kingdom have the same root.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether the Greek word is rendered king or kingdom, it denotes royal authority, or sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In saving us through the blood of Jesus, God desires not only to transfer us into His kingdom but also to make us His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, in God s eyes, we saved ones are not only saved into His kingdom but also constituted to be His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God purchased us by the blood of Jesus for the goal of making us His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His purpose in making us His kingdom is to rule, to reign, to accomplish His will on earth, and to gain a group of people on earth to be under His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every saved person has a measure of the kingdom within him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some have a greater measure and others a smaller measure, but every saved person has the kingdom within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord s salvation brings not only the Lord s life but also the heavenly rule into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know that every saved one has the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Holy Spirit is not only life and power but is connected to the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Holy Spirit in Revelation 4 and 5 is the seven Spirits before God s throne 4:5; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that the Holy Spirit is connected to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit brings not only God s life but also God s throne into us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the one hand, He is the Spirit of power; on the other hand, He is the reigning Spirit, bringing God s throne into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the Spirit who causes God s throne to rule in our spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Spirit in us is not only the Spirit of life and the Spirit of power but also the reigning Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many Christians speak of the Holy Spirit s pouring out of the love of God into us, but few realize that the Holy Spirit also brings and establishes God s throne and authority into us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Holy Spirit is the authority the seven Spirits of God before the throne and He desires to establish the throne in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The seven Spirits of God, the sevenfold intensified Spirit, has entered into us with God s throne and is ruling and reigning within us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we submit to Him, we will be blessed, for the kingdom will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God is recovering His right over the earth in order to make the whole earth His kingdom 11:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When Christ came, He brought the kingdom of God with Him Luke 17:21; Matt 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This kingdom has been enlarged into the church 16:18-19 , which will accomplish the establishing of the kingdom of God on the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On one hand, the kingdom of God today is in the church, but on the other hand, the kingdom of God is coming through the overcoming believers Rev 12:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then Christ and the overcoming believers will reign over all the nations in the millennial kingdom 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we allow Him to exercise His authority to a sufficient extent, we will be a group of overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to God s ordination, all the believers should be under the authority of Christ, should allow Christ to reign, and should be a realm where Christ can exercise His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many saved ones, however, desire the Lord s salvation, the Lord s love, and the Lord s blessings, but they will not allow the Lord to reign in them so that He may gain His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this situation the Lord must do a further work in the church to gain a particular group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Throughout the last two thousand years the line of these lovers of the Lord has never been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Apparently the church is in decline, and indeed the church as a whole is in decline.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, in this decline there are still overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this decline there are still some who love the Lord and tell Him, Lord, I am under Your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am willing to allow Your throne and Your authority to come in. I love Your ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Lord, You are the King, and I am under Your ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I submit to Your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When there is a group of overcomers in the church, these overcomers will bring the authority of heaven, the kingdom of God, to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time the church will be victorious, and the enemy will be powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must seriously learn to be restricted, ruled, and trained under the authority of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only those who receive the training to be under this heavenly authority today will be able to exercise this heavenly authority in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If today we learn to be under God s authority, one day we will be enthroned to rule and reign with His beloved Son.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Revelation 1:6 and 5:10 say that God has made us a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This means that, as citizens of God s kingdom, we allow Him to reign, and we reign for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are the sons of the Almighty God, who is the King of kings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This makes us members of the royal family.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We are not only sons of God but also members of the kingly family.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We need to know today not only that we are citizens of God s kingdom but also that we are actually being trained to be kings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Ultimately, we will reign as kings in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This can be compared to a prince who grows up in a royal palace as a son but is actually being trained to reign as a king one day.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Revelation 20 tells us that in the millennium all the overcomers will be co-kings with Christ, and these co-kings of Christ will be the priests of God and of Christ who will reign with Him for a thousand years v. 6 . In the New Jerusalem we will also reign with Christ in the kingship 22:5 .</S>
