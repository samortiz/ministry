Chapters one through ten, covering the central view of the divine dispensation, were given in Stuttgart, Germany in May
Chapters eleven through fourteen, covering the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity, were given in New York City in June
The best Bible teachers understand that this word denotes God's plan, God's arrangement, of His full salvation
If we look into the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation, we could see God's works and also the goal of God's works
At the end of the Bible there is a city which bears the glory of God and which is the composition of many names
The city bears the glorious image of God, denoting that this composition of God's redeemed ones is the expression of God
We must see, not only God's dispensation, but also the goal of God's dispensation, that is, God is working Himself into His chosen people
In Ephesians 1:10 we can see that there is a plan, an arrangement, or an administration for God to head up all things in Christ
He would work Christ into them so that they all might become the parts and members of Christ with Christ as their Head
There was a need of some management and administration and order and system to distribute the riches of Pharaoh's house
Paul was given the stewardship, the office, the duty, of God's dispensation to distribute all the riches of Christ
His distribution is just to distribute the unsearchable riches of Christ to all of us in order that we may be the expression of God
Finally, at the end of the Bible in Revelation 19:7 there is the marriage of the Lamb whose wife has made herself ready
For the Bible to say that it was not good for man to be alone implies also that it was not good for God to remain alone
After God created Adam, He brought all the animals to him and Adam named them, but he did not find among them a counterpart
It was for this purpose that God created man: to bear His image, to resemble Him in order to be His counterpart
God brought the man who did not yet have God's divine life to the tree of life so that he might eat of the tree of life
Nevertheless God's original intention was that the man who was created in His image should have God's divine life
In John 7 the Lord indicated that whosoever drinks of Him would have the rivers of living water flowing out of his being
If you say that you are now gold, bdellium, and onyx, your wife or those who serve with you may say that they have never seen them
It is by God the Father's golden nature, by God the Son's death and resurrection, and by God the Spirit's transforming work
Plant life in the Bible signifies the producing life of Christ, and animal life signifies the redeeming life of Christ
The sixth dispensation is that of grace, which covers almost the entire New Testament from John the Baptist to the second coming of Christ
Although this teaching is right, they didn't point out clearly what is the ultimate goal of all these dispensations of God
God is going to reach His goal through all the dispensations and complete His work of making us His counterpart
He began to work in Genesis 3, and He works through the entire Old Testament and the New Testament to reach His goal, the New Jerusalem
In the entire universe there will be such an organism to match God, to be His Bride, His counterpart, to satisfy Him and express Him
In our life-study on Genesis we pointed out that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob depict one complete person with Joseph as an annex
That was good news, because after Eve and Adam had eaten of the wrong tree, they were scared and prepared to die
Surely Eve and Adam were scared and they hated that serpent so God promised them that the seed of woman would bruise the head of the serpent
We know that Adam believed this gospel because he called his wife's name Eve, indicating she would be the mother of all who live
In Genesis 4 Enosh realized that he was weak and fragile, so he called upon the name of this ever-existing One
The holy God was altogether free to come to a sinner through Christ, and a sinner like Enoch was free to walk with God
In the Bible walking means to have your life, to have your being, to do things, to say things, to think things, to go anywhere
By walking with God day after day for three hundred years he was kept in everything away from the element and atmosphere of death
As a continuation of Enoch, Noah not only walked with God , but went further and worked with God according to God's salvation
We are building up a practical and present Christ to be a salvation, not only to ourselves, but also to others
The local churches are building up the ark for the salvation of so many others, because we are now in a common interest with God
According to the record of the Bible after Isaac inherited all the riches, his continuation, Jacob, saw a vision in a dream
In Israel we became the prince of God, and in Joseph we reigned to distribute the riches of God to the hungry ones
The end of Genesis shows us a prince of God, filled with God, saturated with God, one with God to express Him and to reign for Him
After being redeemed he was brought back to God and into the divine fellowship with God , and he suffered martyrdom for God's testimony
Paul told us in Philippians 2:12 that we need to be obedient and to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling
Many Christians realize that John 15 speaks of abiding in Christ, but not many know what it means to abide in Christ
You have to pass through all the experiences of Adam and Abel and Enosh and Enoch, and then you have to come to be Noah
At the end of Genesis there was a person who was one with God, bearing God's name, expressing God, and reigning with God and for God
Up to that point God was in the tabernacle because He had infused Himself into His people in a more complete way
You were very vigorous to walk out of this world, but you could not overcome your temper or your besetting sin
Eating the Lamb enables you to walk out of Egypt, but it is unleavened bread that enables you to live a life without leaven
Every morning when we spend a few minutes with the Lord, we do have the sensation that Christ in the heavens is raining upon us
In Exodus we have to see the redeeming Christ the crucified Christ the resurrected Christ the Christ of ascension and the pneumatic Christ
After experiencing the Passover eating of the heavenly manna and drinking of the living water the children of Israel arrived at Mount Sinai
Today due to the background, many Christians don't like the word Sinai because that was where the law was given
After enjoying all these riches outside on the altar, we need to enter into the tabernacle to enjoy the riches within the tabernacle
Right by the side of such a testimony there is a golden pot, that is, the divine nature, holding the hidden Christ for your enjoyment
The hidden Christ in the divine nature affords you the hidden manna to strengthen you to fulfill the testimony
We don't want simply to learn about His dispensation; we want to enjoy His dispensing, He Himself being dispensed into our being
Immediately after the tabernacle was completed in Exodus 40, the Lord called unto Moses and spoke to him out of the tabernacle
Today the tabernacle is the proper church life where there is a kind of infusing with God's constant and instant speaking
When the tabernacle was completed, the glory of the Lord descended, overshadowed the tabernacle, and filled it up
As long as you are kept in the church life, you are in the Lord's leading, and you are on the highway of God's purpose
In the past two messages we have seen the central view of the divine dispensation in the books of Genesis and Exodus
In this message we want to see God's dispensing through the rest of the books of the Old Testament, from Leviticus to Malachi
Today's situation among the Christians has also become a scorched and dry land, with very little rain and nearly no dew
All these items-rain and dew, hills and valleys, springs, brooks, and deep waters-bring forth the riches of all kinds of produce
Deuteronomy 8:9 says that the land is a land 'whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass'
When you read many of the Psalms you can realize that when the Psalmists talked about the temple they became very excited
All this portrays the enjoyment of Christ in the church life, and this is the result of God's dispensing Himself in Christ into our being
Very few Christians have the thought that God is dispensing, distributing, and imparting Himself into His chosen people
It was only after 1950, within the last thirty years, that we began to see and to minister that God is dispensing Himself into our being
If the guests come to the kitchen and simply admire the plan and arrangement and do not receive any food they would remain hungry
The central view of God's dispensation is just God Himself as our rich food dispensed into our being, as the Lord Jesus told us in John 6
Still more of God was dispensed into Enosh and Enoch, and progressively more into Noah and Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
Although we are not God, we are divine, because God's divine life and nature have been dispensed into our being
The unapproachable, invisible, hidden, mysterious, and abstract God became solid, visible, touchable, and even enterable
When the Lord Jesus was staying with the disciples, before His death and resurrection, all the disciples were around Him
After the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the way was paved and the door was opened for all the disciples to enter into Him
The Lord Jesus had spent three and a half years to prepare the disciples to receive God into them as grace and reality
The Lord Jesus prepared His disciples for three and one-half years, and then one day He went to the cross and died on the cross
If man would enter into God and God would dispense Himself into man, surely this obstacle of sin must be removed
The Lord Jesus died on the cross as a brass serpent, that is, in the likeness of the flesh of sin , to deal with our serpentine nature
By the cross sin was taken away, the world was judged, Satan was destroyed, and our serpentine nature was dealt with
God has not only saved us, but also dispensed Himself into our being to make us the children of God, even to make us divine
It is clearly of two parts: the first part is for Him to come to us, and the second part is for Him to go back to God
On the negative side the Lord's death dealt with all the negative things, but on the positive side His death released His divine life
Not only has life been released, but it has also been presented to us so that we may receive it by calling upon His name
We have to realize that since the Lord Jesus has gone through incarnation and death, He is now in resurrection
The first thing that the Lord Jesus does in resurrection is that He imparts His divine life into the believers
When a grain of wheat rises up from the dirt, it brings forth many grains which are its manifestation, its glorification
The life within the Lord Jesus, within the one grain, was released and imparted and dispensed into many grains
Even as the way to release the life within the Lord Jesus was through death, so the way for us to enjoy life is also through death
To our way of thinking the church will be built up but in Johns vision the church was already built up and the Bride had made herself ready
It is by God's dispensing in the resurrection of Jesus Christ that He obtains a Bride, a wife, composed of all the regenerated ones
Regeneration in Christ's resurrection is just God dispensing Himself into you, and this dispensing issues in a Bride to Christ
Today's Christians mostly stress the ethical teachings such as husbands love your wives, and wives submit yourselves to your husbands
Eventually no wife can give the proper submission, and no husband can give the proper love apart from God's dispensing
Christianity has become mostly an ethical religion, but the Lord's recovery is the living God dispensing Himself into all His chosen people
Eventually this dispensing Christ who has mingled Himself with us will overflow from within us like rivers of living water for all eternity
Let us read Romans 9:5: 'Whose are the fathers, and out of whom according to flesh is the Christ, Who is over all, God blessed forever
Our Christ is the very God, the very Creator, who is blessed forever, yet for the purpose of dispensing God into us He became a man
The heavens were created for the earth, the earth was created for man, and man was created for God's dispensing
If the Lord Jesus has not been dispensed into you, and you do not have Him within you, He cannot be rich to you for your enjoyment
Romans 832 says He Who did not spare His own Son but delivered Him up for us all how shall He not also with Him freely give us all things
Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance wrote a number of good hymns which are very deep
They may say that they have problems with their wife or problems with a certain brother or problems with the elders
Whatever God the Father is, whatever God the Son is, and whatever God the Spirit is, is all embodied in this one Person
The Lord Jesus is the effulgence, the expression, of God's glory, and He is the very image, the expression of God's substance
Christ has solved this problem, taking away our sin, to remove the obstacle so that God can have a free way to dispense Himself into us
On the day of the Passover the blood of the lamb was shed for all the children of Israel, and God's condemnation passed over them
There were problems between us and God, but Christ is our Mediator to make everything right so that God can dispense Himself into us
Just a little unhappiness with your wife becomes a problem and the heavenly 'electricity' doesn't work so well
The feeding on the grass is to receive the life supply, so the shepherd's business is to dispense life into the sheep
He preached the unsearchable riches of Christ so that all the believers might receive more of God, more of the divine life
Whenever the divine life is dispensed into us, we have the power and wisdom, the righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
In the wilderness the Israelites ate the spiritual food, the manna, and drank of a spiritual rock which followed them
As we enjoy Him by eating of Him and drinking of Him and putting Him on as our clothing He becomes our treasure
Hebrews 1:6 says, 'And, when He brings again the Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, And let all the angels of God worship Him'
Through the process of the death and resurrection the only begotten Son became the Firstborn among many brothers
Ephesians 1:22 says that 'He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church'
Corinthians 15:20 says, 'But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep'
Verse 23 says, 'But each one in his own order: the firstfruit, Christ; after that those who are Christ's at His coming'
Corinthians 15:45 says, 'So also it is written, The first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit'
Thank You, Lord, for Your cleansing blood which opens up the way for You to come in to dispense and saturate us with Yourself
In the Epistles of the New Testament, especially those of Paul, the phrase, 'in Christ', or, 'in the Lord' occurs frequently
In Acts 13:33 Peter indicated to us that when the Lord Jesus was raised up in resurrection, He was begotten of God
Since He was the Son of God before His resurrection, why did He still need to be born in resurrection to be the Son of God?
Sometimes in human birth there are twins, that is, one delivery with two children or triplets, that is, one delivery with three children
In the resurrection of Christ, in that delivery, there were not only two or three children, but millions of children
He was the only begotten Son of God before His resurrection, but through His resurrection the only begotten Son became the firstborn Son
Today we are in the process of death and resurrection so that we might be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God
Before a man becomes a father he is only one, but after the birth of his child, his life has been dispensed into another one
We who are the children, the issue of His dispensing, and the Father, the source of this dispensing, dwell together in this house
Even as the church today is the fullness of Christ, so in the same principle, the New Jerusalem will be the fullness of the Triune God
That will be the total expression of God through His dispensing of Himself into His chosen people throughout all the generations
You will aspire for the divine dispensing of the divine life, the divine nature, and the divine glory to be increased in your being
Peter also has one precious point which Paul did not mention, that is, we are the partakers of the divine nature
Otherwise, in the entire Bible there would not be a word telling us that we are now enjoying the very essence of God
By this illustration you may have a little apprehension of what it means for us to be partakers of the divine nature
As soon as we were regenerated there was a kind of nature within us that would not agree for us to do certain things
God's nature is within God's life, so the very divine life with which we have been born again has within it the divine nature
If you put something sweet into his mouth he will swallow it, and if you put something bitter into his mouth he will spit it out
If the Author of life had not died, He could not have been released in resurrection for the dispensing of God into His chosen people
John 17:2 says, 'Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him'
To have the authority over all flesh means to be the Lord of all the people so that He might give eternal life to them
Christ is the agent of God's dispensing, who carries out God's dispensing by being the anointed One to anoint every one whom God has chosen
Jesus is our Savior, not just to save us from our sins, but also to dispense the eternal life into our being for our subjective salvation
Christ's redemption according to 1 Peter 1:18 is not just to redeem us from sin or from hell, but to redeem us from our vain manner of life
We can become a living stone because this living stone has been dispensed into us and lives in us to make us living
As we have mentioned previously the main point in taking care of the sheep is to feed them so that they may have more life
The shepherd first takes care of us to feed us and eventually becomes our overseer to keep us always under the life dispensing
As those who have been born of the incorruptible seed we are newborn babes who long for the guileless milk of the word
When you have just a little time of morning watch in the Word, you will come out of your room with your face shining
For this purpose God has given us all things relating to life and godliness , and also given us precious and exceedingly great promises
Eventually we will be perfected established strengthened and grounded by Gods life dispensing that we may be brought into Gods eternal glory
Because God has begotten us and we have the eternal life, we are the firstfruits of life among all the created items
When the Father of lights begot us, He dispensed His life into our being to make us a kind of firstfruit among His creatures
They begin from God in eternity past, and consummate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity future
At the end of John's writings, in chapter twenty-two of Revelation, you can see that eternal life is flowing as the river of water of life
He is the Son of Man for redemption, to take away our sin and solve the problems between us and God, that God might be dispensed into us
God does not have blood to shed for our redemption, nor does the Son of God have blood, but the Lamb, the Son of Man, has blood
The Lord Jesus became the propitiation concerning our sins between us and God to create a peaceful situation for the life dispensing
In the Greek alphabet Christ is the first letter, Alpha, the last letter, Omega, and all the letters in between
With the divine things there is no beginning and no ending because whatever is divine is eternal, having no beginning and no ending
When you get into the Bible and see all the items of Christ's being, you can see they are just for the divine dispensing
The confusion at Babel destroyed the universal language, but two words were not destroyed, hallelujah and amen
To partake of such a fellowship may not be so substantial as partaking of the divine nature which Peter mentions
We may use the chicken to illustrate the divine nature, and chicken soup to illustrate the fellowship of the divine life
Sometimes we Christians make a lot of noise, either to our wife, or to our husband, or to the elders, or to the brothers
The lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God, with God the Father's nature, God the Son's form, and God the Spirit's expression
Every proper local church is composed with God the Father's nature, God the Son's form, and God the Spirit's expression
The highest expression Paul used concerning the church is that the church is the fullness of Christ and the fullness of God
As the church we should be the golden lampstand, and we should also be the harvest with the firstfruit as the expression of life
As a golden lampstand and as the harvest with the firstfruit, we also become the Bride of the Lamb as His increase and satisfaction
In Revelation 19 the church as the wife, has made herself ready for the marriage of the Lamb for His satisfaction
God as the Father is the source, the Spirit as the water of life is the flow, and the Son as the tree of life is the life supply
The life-dispensing river circles the entire city as it flows downward from the throne of the Lamb-God in a spiral flowing
No other book in the Bible reveals the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-so clearly and so much in detail as the Gospel of John
In chapter one, verse 1 God is revealed: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
Eventually the holy pneuma, the Holy Spirit, reaches us not objectively, but subjectively by entering into our very being
Before you came to the recovery, you probably had never heard a message using this word dispensing concerning the Divine Trinity
In this connotation dispensation becomes an equivalent to the Greek word oikonomia, which is anglicized into the English word economy
Many readers of the Bible have realized that in the Gospel of John the Father is revealed, the Son is revealed, and the Spirit is revealed
There are two Greek words used for the English word sent, one of which means to be sent with a special commission
The brass serpent did bear the form and appearance and likeness of a real serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent
Romans 8:3 says that the law was impossible in that it was weak through the flesh, so God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin
He has condemned sin in our nature; He has become the propitiation to deal with all our sins, offenses, and trespasses
In his one Gospel, John uses three illustrations concerning the death of Christ: the Lamb of God , the brass serpent , and a grain of wheat
The Lamb of God and the brass serpent are for dealing with sin and our sinful nature, but the grain of wheat is for life imparting
The Father not only comes with the Son, but after the Son comes to live and work on the earth, the Father lives with Him and works with Him
He does not speak His own word; He speaks the Father's word , and He does the Father's work , not His own work
He is in you, He is abiding in you, He is dwelling in you to be your life, your life supply, and your everything
The Lord Jesus said If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
When He abides in you the Triune Godthe Father the Son and the Spiritabide in you to be your life your life supply and your everything
The story of the Samaritan woman in chapter four shows that even our worship to God may veil us from knowing and seeing the real God
On the positive side, this book shows us the divine revelation concerning the Triune God being dispensed into our being
On the negative side, it shows us the veils-religion, human thought, natural concepts, and even concepts concerning the worship of God
In verse 25 Jesus said to her, 'I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live'
If you would not prepare yourself by dropping your religion, ethics, and natural thinking, you will be unable to get much from this message
Man was made according to God in the image of God so in mans created nature there is the element of love light holiness and righteousness
Although we have been redeemed, and regenerated, and even though we may love the Lord very much, yet we do nearly everything in our own name
The tabernacle, of course, is a figure of speech, and to understand it, you have to study the tabernacle in Exodus
Chapter one of John says that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us
You have heard of the almighty God and the omnipresent God, but you probably have never heard of the enterable God
Just to know that He is almighty and omnipresent does not mean so much, but to know that He is enterable means a lot
In the Gospel of John we are told that in eternity past the Son and the Father coexisted, because the Word was with God
You cannot separate them because the First is embodied in the Second, and the Second is the very embodiment of the First
When we called on the Lord and were saved, right away we had the realization that Someone had come into our being
It seems the Son is in us; later it seems the Father is also in us; eventually it seems the Spirit is in us as well
Christians today may talk about the Trinity, but after talking, they forget about it and live in their own name
We need to see such a vision that in God's economy He doesn't want something else; He only wants to work Himself into our being
Christ the Son coexists and coinheres with the Father so that He with the Father might be dispensed into our being
The Father was the cause of the Son's living on earth; the Father was not just an instrument through or by which the Son lived
Without the Father as His cause, the Son's living on earth for thirty-three and a half years would have been altogether vain
The Lord told us in John 6:38 that He came down from heaven not to do His own will, but the will of the Father who sent Him
The Son came in the Father's name, He did the Father's will, He spoke the Father's word, and He sought the Father's glory
In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus said that the Father and He would come to the lover of Him and make their abode with him
By the foregoing verses, verses 16-20, we can see that the Son would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality
Eventually the Lord indicated in verse 18 that the coming One, the Spirit of reality, is actually just Himself
All this is God the Father dispensing Himself into us through God the Son and in God the Son and by God the Spirit
The first two verses of the Gospel of John mention God, but they do not mention the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in clear words
The Lord talked to His disciples in John 14:16-20, indicating that the Comforter who would come was just Himself in another form
According to these verses, it would seem that there are two in us, the Spirit of reality and the Lord Jesus Himself
In their teaching they say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three persons, not only distinct but also separate
The Son was sent by the Father to condemn sin, to judge the world, and to cast out Satan through His death on the cross
These illustrations may help you to realize that the matter of the Triune God is not merely for teaching, but is for dispensing
Doctrinally we may not fully understand the Triune God, but in experience we can testify that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in us
The Father is the source, the initiator, the Son is the expression, the accomplisher, and the Spirit is the entering in, the applier
It is only when the power is installed into your house that the electricity becomes practical in your daily life
A bonafide Christian is simply one who lives a life of this reality, a life of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
If you live such a life, the world will be judged, the Devil will flee, and all sinful things will be overcome
The Triune God becomes your life, your living, your victory, your holiness, your righteousness, your love, your life, and your light
It also denotes one who is taking care of your case like an attorney, or who intercedes for you like an intercessor
Such a One is your helper, your patron, your counselor, your comforter who takes care of your needs in your daily life
In Romans 8:9-11 three divine titles are used interchangeably: the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ
They think that today they have only the Holy Spirit in them; they don't have the Father, and they don't have the Son
Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, are distinct, they are one, inseparable, indivisible, and undivided
When we Christians say that we should grow in life, we mean that we should grow with the element and essence of the Triune God
Before the death and resurrection of Christ the Spirit was not yet because Christ had not completed the process which He had to go through
One day He went into death, passed through death, and entered into resurrection, and then He became the life-giving Spirit
Without the Spirit, the Son would be objective to the believers and could not be subjective to them in their experiences of Him
When the Spirit discloses what the Son is to the believers and makes Him real to them in their life, the Son is glorified
After the death and resurrection of the Son, the Spirit came in the Son's name to testify concerning the Son and to glorify the Son
Between the Gospel of John and the book of Revelation are John's Epistles, which cover the fellowship of the divine life
The consummation of the divine dispensing in the book of Revelation is mainly in the first three chapters and the last two
Both the lampstands in this age and the New Jerusalem in eternity are the marvelous issue and consummation of the divine dispensing
To you it may not seem so prevailing, powerful, or evident, but to God and His enemy Satan, it is very evident
We like to see things that are evident on the surface, but God does not care so much for things which are superficially evident
How foolish it is if we are busy doing other works and do not care for this current, the Triune God dispensing Himself into us!
Peter 1:2 tells us that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8 tells us that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4 tells us that the Spirit is God
If you read the Bible in a superficial way, you may believe that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate persons
If you touch the depth in the verses that cover these points, you will realize that the Son and the Father are one
Revelation 1:4 speaks of the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and 4:5 speaks of the seven Spirits of God
God the Son, the Second of the Trinity, is the lamp, and God the Father, the First of the Trinity, is the light, the glory, within the lamp
John in his Revelation says that the Third is the eyes of the Second, and that the Second is the lamp with the First within as the light
The second One is the unique lamp to contain the First as the light, and the third One is the seven lamps to express the Second
What does it mean that the Third is the seven lamps as the seven eyes of the Second, who is the unique lamp to contain the First?
The lampstand is not just a piece of gold without a proper shape; it is a piece of gold shaped into a certain form
The twelve gates of the New Jerusalem, which are twelve pearls , signify God the Son's overcoming death and His life-imparting resurrection
Christ's overcoming death plus His life-imparting resurrection secretes the 'juice' of the divine life to form us into pearls
After regeneration, the Spirit continues to transform the regenerated people of God to make every one of them a precious stone
In his Gospel John prepares the way to show us that these three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-are not separate
He is qualified to be such a husband to marry the wife, who is the consummation of all the redeemed and regenerated people of God
The crucial focus of the book of Ephesians is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into all the believers
As the title of this message indicates, the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in Ephesians issues in the church
Grace is a Person, the very God Himself, dispensed into our spirit to be our life and life supply so that we may enjoy Him
Peace is the issue, the result, the fruit, of our enjoyment of the very God within us, the One who has been dispensed into us
Through nearly twenty centuries of Christian history, teachers and theologians have tried to explain the Trinity
The Son came not in His own name, but in the Father's name , and in Isaiah 9:6 is even called the everlasting Father
The Son did the Fathers work He did the Fathers will He spoke the Fathers word He sought the Fathers glory and He expressed the Father
Because man was the representative of the whole creation, his death caused all of creation to lose the heading up and become scattered
Christ's redemption takes away our sin so that death may be swallowed and that all the members may be headed up through the life-dispensing
The Spirit's dispensing is His sealing 'unto the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of His glory'
We have a sealing, the saturating, of the Holy Spirit, within us, and this sealing will continue until the day our body is fully saturated
The Spirit is also a pledge, a foretaste, of our divine inheritance, guaranteeing the full taste of God as our eternal inheritance
According to an ancient practice, when someone bought a piece of land, the seller would give him a bag of soil as a sample for a pledge
It is by the life-dispensing of the Triune God that such a power, even a power of surpassing greatness, has been applied to all of us
Before God began to dispense Himself into His chosen ones, we became fallen not only into sin, but also into death
Unbelievers walk in death according to the age of the world and according to the spiritual power in the air and within them
When God called out Israel, He recovered the lost rights and made Israel a commonwealth with the proper rights to enjoy God's blessing
When God called Israel to be His commonwealth to receive all the promises and to enjoy all the rights, He told them to circumcise themselves
In the first section of Romans it was sin and sins which were taken care of in order that we could be justified
In our salvation God has made us alive, He has raised us up together, and He has seated us with Christ in the heavenlies
We are poems written by the threefold life-dispensing of the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow
Christ is the means, the element, the sphere, for God to enliven us, to raise us up, and to seat us in the heavens
At one time we were far off from God, from God's commonwealth, Israel, from God's covenant, from Christ, from all the blessings
To say that He abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances does not mean that He abolished the Ten Commandments
He abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances, the middle wall that separated the Jews from the Gentiles
Christ's death on the cross released His divine life that was confined within Him, even as the life of a seed is confined within its shell
By His all-inclusive and wonderful death, Christ created both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers into one new man
Because Christ has abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances and because we all have the dispensing of the divine life we are one
When Christ preaches such a gospel by Himself as the life-giving Spirit, and when we hear and accept such a gospel, what do we receive?
The Father is the source who planned all things, and the Son is the means, the course, who accomplished the Father's purpose
Christ became the channel in which and the means by which God enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies
The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father through the Son
The first issue of the divine dispensing is that we are fellow-citizens of the saints and members of the household of God
The threefold God-God the Father, Christ the Son, and the Spirit-is dispensing Himself into us as life and as our life supply
If you are not in your spirit, although you may be in the meeting, you are not in the church in a practical way
In English a stewardship refers to the duty, office, or responsibility of one who is carrying out the dispensation
Peter in his First Epistle says that we all should minister the gift we have received 'as good stewards of the varied grace of God'
Paul was commissioned and committed by God with this plan to carry out God's dispensing of His riches as grace
The joint-heirs are joint-partakers of the promise in Christ, that is, joint-partakers of all the riches in Christ
The king of Egypt had a great house full of food supply, and he needed a household administration to distribute this supply
The dispensing of the rich food of God's household is to make the nations, the Gentiles, joint-heirs of God with the Jewish believers
To those on earth the church is a poem, a masterpiece, but to the fallen angels in the air the church is a great exhibition
What does it mean to be strengthened through the Spirit with power according to the riches of God's glory into our inner man?
The more we look at the environment and the more we consider our situation, the more we feel that we are poor and that we cannot go on
To say that we need to be strengthened into the inner man indicates that we are not in the inner man, that we live mostly in the outer man
When a brother tells his wife that he is tired, he is in the outer man, in the mind, living according to his physical tiredness
You need to practice bowing your knees to the Father that He would strengthen you into your inner man from your tiredness
Even when we are sick, we need to pray that the Father would strengthen us from our sickness into our inner man
If we are in such a situation, we need to be strengthened from our thinking into our inner man and turn to our spirit and pray
For Christ to make His home in our heart means that He must settle Himself in our emotion, will, mind, and conscience
We have Christ in us in a general way but we may not have Christ in us in a particular way saturating our mind emotion will and conscience
You are short of the life-dispensing into your mind, emotion, will, and conscience to saturate your entire being
When Christ makes His home in our heart, we shall be filled not with all the fullness of God, but unto all the fullness of God
When we are filled up to such an extent that Christ overflows from within our being, we become the fullness of God, the expression of God
Chapter one speaks of the fullness of Christ , but chapter three speaks of the fullness of God, which is wider and richer
A shoulder, being a large member, receives a large volume of blood, whereas a finger, being a small member, receives a small amount of blood
In verses 7 and 29 grace refers to Christ as the divine life dispensed into our being for our enjoyment and supply
Another diamond in Ephesians 4 is truth: 'Since indeed you have heard Him and been taught in Him as the truth is in Jesus'
Concerning truth verse 24 says And have put on the new man which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth
Ephesians 1 is structured with the Father's selection and predestination, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's sealing and pledging
In Ephesians 4 Paul first speaks of the one Body and then of the one Spirit, the one Lord, and the one God, the Father
In Ephesians 4 the mystical Body, the church, is the sphere, the element, for the development of the Triune God
When Paul speaks of the one God and Father of all in verse 6, he says that the Father is over all, through all, and in all
The Trinity revealed in Ephesians 1 has been dispensed into all the believers, and this dispensing issues in the Body
Now we should walk in the same God, in the One who has been dispensed into us as grace for our enjoyment and as truth for our reality
On the one hand, this life is our grace for enjoyment; on the other hand, this life is our reality for us to live a real life
To say that the Body is mingled with the Divine Trinity means that the Body is saturated with life permeated with life and soaked with life
The verb form is found in verse 15; the noun form, growth, in verse 16; and the participle form, full-grown, in verse 13
With the saints in the local churches in the Lord's recovery there are the enjoyment of grace and also the reality of the truth
On the one hand, we are told that we have put on the new man; on the other hand, we are told that we are being renewed
Our mind needs to be saturated with the spirit, and it needs to be under the control and direction of the spirit
When you believed in the Lord Jesus, He as the life-giving Spirit entered your spirit and regenerated you with Himself as life
When our mind is saturated with the regenerated spirit it is saturated with the Triune God, who is in our regenerated spirit
While the Triune God is dispensing Himself into us as our life, we enjoy grace and reality, we are being renewed, and we grow
Every member of the Body, whether small or large, has received something of the Triune God as supply, as grace ministered to that member
Even we who are small members have a measure, and according to the measure of every part, the Body is supplied to grow
In chapter two this plan is carried out, it advances in chapter three, and it comes to its development in chapter four
In His death on the cross, Christ abolished all of the commandments in ordinances to create a new man out of the Jews and the Gentiles
In chapter one the thought of the Body is introduced, and in chapter two the thought of the new man is introduced
The development of the Body in its being mingled with the Divine Trinity in life, grace, and truth is for the new man
It is not easy for us to see what is in Ephesians 5 because we have layer upon layer of veils covering our spiritual eyes
No matter what our background may be, we may say that we Christians all have four layers of veils that hinder our sight
When they are right, they are proud and want you to see them, but when they are wrong, they want to stay away from you
Although she may not understand any other verse, she may pay attention to the verse regarding husbands loving their wives
A brother who is a husband may do the same thing with the verse that says that wives should be subject to their own husbands
Whenever we come to the Bible, we come with our thought, concept, desire, aspiration, attitude, opinion, or understanding
In the following verses Paul goes on to say that we need to walk as children of light who understand the will of the Lord
By enjoying grace and truth we are brought back to the source of grace and truth, God the Father as love and light
What is revealed in chapter five concerning love and light is deeper than what is revealed in chapter four concerning grace and truth
The dispensing of the Divine Trinity constitutes us children of light walking in love, or we may say children of God walking in God
Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity we all need to be filled in our spirit with the Spirit as the divine wine
A real Christian is one who experiences such a dispensing, and the aggregate of all such Christians is the church
The issue of the divine dispensing is that we can be in subjection to one another in the fear of Christ for the proper Christian life
Of being filled with wrath, anger, or indignation, we should be filled with all that God is, filled even to the fullness of God
These children of light are speaking, singing, psalming, thanking, and living a life of subjection to one another
Grace and truth are for the new man to accomplish Gods eternal purpose but love and light are for the Bride to satisfy Christ as the Husband
If we have this view of Ephesians 5, we shall see where the church should be and what the church should be like
We have seen that for the new man in chapter four we need grace and truth, and that for the Bride in chapter five we need love and light
Inwardly, we are filled with the divine power, the divine dynamo or divine electricity, and outwardly we are clothed with the divine armor
The church as the warrior must bear the burden to defeat God's enemy by being empowered inwardly and clothed with the armor outwardly
If we have the power inwardly and the armor outwardly, we shall be strengthened and equipped to fight the battle for God
In his marvelous book, Pilgrim's Progress, John Bunyan likens the individual Christian to a warrior, as revealed in Ephesians 6
The purpose of the Lord's recovery is not merely to recover doctrines, but to recover us through life, through the divine breath
Since the electricity has already been installed, we simply need to turn on the switch, and then these appliances will be empowered
We who love God and seek Christ should have a daily living that, in a practical way, is filled with God as reality
He does not have a girdle of truth around his loins; that is, he does not have God as reality in his daily living
If we are girded with truth, with reality, we shall be able to stand up boldly in the meetings and testify as those who are full of vigor
If we do not deal with these accusations, we may develop a hole in our conscience, and our faith and peace will leak out
The peace in 6:15 refers to the peace Christ made on the cross when He reconciled the Jews and Gentiles to God
He took away sins and sin, and He nailed to the cross the commandments in ordinances that once separated us from others
As a corporate warrior empowered inwardly and covered outwardly, we should now use the sword to fight against God's enemy
Ephesians 6 concludes with the words, 'Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
These verses indicate that eventually the church will be in such a condition to enjoy peace and love with faith and grace
In some recent messages we pointed out that the book of Ephesians is structured with the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
Although we have given many messages on Romans, in the past we did not emphasize the matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
In 1:1 Paul says that he was 'separated to the gospel of God,' and in 1:16 he says that he is not ashamed of the gospel
Simultaneously we are being transformed with the divine life and by it we shall eventually be conformed to the image of Gods firstborn Son
On the subjective side of God's full salvation the matter of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is strongly implied
Beginning from 5:12 and continuing through chapter eight, the book of Romans covers the subjective side of God's salvation
In these chapters we see that we who were once in Adam have been transferred out of Adam into Christ by believing in the Lord Jesus
We have the power to reign over every negative thing, that is, over everything that is not a positive testimony to God
As we read Romans 5:10 and 17, we need to pay careful attention to two important phrases: 'saved in His life' and 'reign in life'
As we go on from chapters five and six to chapters seven and eight, we are brought on from doctrine to experience
In chapter eight we have the continuation and the development of the saving and reigning life revealed in chapter five
In Romans 8 we have not only the saving and reigning life itself; we have the Spirit and also the law of this life
Verse 3 speaks of the Son: 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
As we go on to verse 11, we see that it is also possible for life, the divine, eternal life, to be given to our mortal body
God has predestinated and justified us, and now He is conforming us, molding us, to the image of His firstborn Son
We have the Trinity, the process, and our subjective experience, which involves our spirit, our mind, and our body
When we put all these matters together, we see the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our tripartite being
The Father sent the Son, and the Son came to accomplish redemption, which consummates in the life-giving Spirit
The aggregate, the totality, of all this is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity into the three parts of our being
My burden in this message is to point out from Romans 8 that we need more and more of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
In the foregoing message we began to consider the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the book of Romans
Although the word 'dispensing' is not used in this book, the fact of the divine dispensing is nonetheless found in this Epistle
The central thought of the book of Romans is that God is producing sons for the formation of the Body of Christ
If someone has not been regenerated, born again, he is not a child of God, and he is not a member of the Body of Christ
An unregenerated person may be a member of a particular religious group, but he cannot be a member of the living Body of Christ
Only through regeneration can we become the living, organic members of the Body of Christ, which is an organism, not an organization
We may use dentures as an illustration to show that every member of the Body of Christ must be living and organic
Simply complaining about having to do the dishes so often causes this brother to lose the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
As a result, when the brother comes to the church meeting, he is not able to praise the Lord or even say 'Amen'
According to the divine fact when we believed in the Lord Jesus He the very embodiment of the Triune God came as the Spirit into our spirit
In 8:10 Paul says, 'And if Christ is in you, though the body is dead because of sin, yet the spirit is life because of righteousness'
During our time with the Lord in the morning, we should set aside our concern about other things and pay attention to the divine dispensing
Through the working of this law, the essence, the element, and the riches of the divine life are being dispensed into our being
Through the working of this law, we shall also be conformed to the image of Christ and eventually be glorified in His divine element
Not even proper biblical doctrine can avail to sanctify us, transform us, conform us to the image of Christ, and glorify us
As we breathe in air to maintain our physical life, we simply need to breathe in the Triune God in order to experience His dispensing
Through this dispensing you will be saturated with the Triune God, and in this way your whole being will be sanctified
Confucius is one who taught people to improve themselves by developing something within them called the bright virtue
We may now enjoy what He has accomplished through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and enjoy Him as the life-giving Spirit
It is a fact that, according to 8:11, the Spirit of the One who raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead dwells in our spirit
The Spirit within us is continually anointing us, continually 'painting' us with the divine 'paint,' the divine essence
The Holy Spirit as the ointment is the paint, and this paint includes the divine holiness and all the divine virtues and attributes
Whether we call this anointing or dispensing, this is a matter of the processed Triune God being applied to us in our experience
According to verse 11 if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us this One will give life to our mortal body
These verses indicate that the soaking, the saturating, begins with our spirit, spreads to our mind, and eventually reaches our mortal body
He is spreading Himself into every part of our being and saturating us with Himself until we are fully soaked with all that He is
The goal of God's salvation is to make us sons of God so that we may be the living members of the Body of His Son, Jesus Christ
If we would be faithful in preaching the complete gospel of God, we need to preach concerning all four stations in the book of Romans
In order to reach the Body of Christ, we need to participate in all the divine provisions afforded us in Romans 8
We may say that in speaking of the law of the Spirit of life, Paul is referring to something that can be compared to a scientific principle
Because of the influence of modern scientific studies, it is not difficult for us to understand what a natural law is
A peach tree would never produce fruit with such a shape, because that would be contrary to the law of a peach tree
We have experienced the divine birth, and through this divine birth we have received the divine life, the highest life
Because the highest law, the law of the divine life, is operating within us, there is no need for us to strive to overcome negative things
If the peach tree is watered and fertilized, it will grow, and as it grows, the law within it will work spontaneously
We need an unveiling, a disclosure, of the fact that within us as Christians there is such a divine, profound, and mysterious law
In either case, there is no need for teaching, for the human life in the baby operates automatically according to its law
We have emphasized the fact that in the divine life there is a divine law and that this law works automatically
The next day he may begin to realize that there is something living within him that does not agree with certain things
Through regeneration he has received the divine life with the divine law, and this law is now working within him
As a result of the working of the divine law, this new believer has the feeling that he should no longer do certain things
On the positive side, this new believer can now receive the rich provisions of the divine life to live the Christian life
Paul speaks of a second divine provision in 8:14: 'For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God'
As a result, there is a struggle within this young brother, a struggle between his own desire and the leading of the Spirit
Because we have the indwelling Spirit leading us, we are not under the control of some powerful person who exerts a strong influence upon us
In our church life we do not have a regulation which says that the brothers should have their hair cut in a certain way
Suppose a young brother wants to have his hair cut in a particular way, but the leading Spirit within him does not agree
Because he has the leading of the indwelling Spirit, he will know spontaneously how he should have his hair cut
The sister was thinking that perhaps others would laugh at her if she said that she was charged for one hamburger instead of two
Within us we have the Spirit of God for our enjoyment, and this enjoyment is the foretaste and guarantee that we shall have the full taste
We have the divine law, the leading of the Spirit, the witness of the Spirit, and the Spirit as the foretaste for the coming full taste
After passing through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, our God has become the Spirit dwelling within us
We have such a wonderful mingled spirit, our human spirit regenerated by the divine Spirit and indwelt by the divine Spirit
If we truly live according to spirit, we shall not lose our temper, argue with our husband or wife, gossip, or murmur
Of hundreds of commandments, Paul gives us a unique commandment-to live, walk, and have our being according to spirit
The problem of your temper will be solved, not by your effort, but as the result of your living according to spirit
By walking according to spirit, we shall keep ourselves under the 'shower' of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
In 8:6 Paul goes on to say, 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'
In 2 Timothy 1:7 Paul says, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind'
We should not take the matters of walking according to spirit and setting our mind on the spirit merely as doctrine
We shall be absolutely under the divine dispensing, and we shall participate in this rich dispensing and enjoy it
If we do not by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body, how could our body ever be presented to the Lord for the Body life?
In order to have our body presented to God for the Body of Christ, we need to put to death the practices of the body
The reason this putting to death is necessary is that our body is occupied by many different kinds of practices
When he returns to the meetings, he may claim that in the past weeks he has been too busy to attend the meetings
A young sister may spend much time in front of the mirror dressing herself but she may say that she does not have the time to read the Bible
A brother may spend much time reading a newspaper and yet claim that he does not have time for the church life
The body must first be set free from various practices, and then it can be presented to the Lord according to Paul's word in 12:1
Rather, the teaching concerning the Body would merely be a doctrine to us, and our talk regarding the Body would be vain
We know that Paul did not conclude the Epistle to the Romans with chapter twelve, but went on until he came to chapter sixteen
In verse 4 Paul refers to 'all the churches of the nations,' and in verse 5, to the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila
Following this we see, in the second part of chapter five and in chapters six through eight, that in Christ we are being sanctified
It is by this dispensing that we are sanctified, transformed, and made living members of the Body of Christ in chapter twelve
Praise the Lord that the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issues in the genuine Body life practiced in the local churches!
As far as the church life is concerned, these two Epistles are deeper than Romans, for they are more practical
If we stay in the realm of doctrine or if we approach the church in a theoretical way, everything may seem to be fine
We, the church, the masterpiece of God's work, are also a poem, expressing God's infinite wisdom and divine design
We, the church, as the masterpiece of God's work, are an absolutely new item in the universe, an item freshly brought forth by God
Since the church is a new creation, we are not the church when we live in our old nature or by the old creation
In the last book of the New Testament, the book of Revelation, we see that the Triune God is Himself this alphabet
Revelation 1:8 says, 'I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty'
Not only is God the first and last letter of the alphabet; He is also the other letters, all the letters between Alpha and Omega
In Revelation 22:13 the Lord Jesus says, 'I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the beginning and the end'
Our Triune God is the whole alphabet: the Alpha, the Beta, the Gamma, the Delta, and all the letters through Omega
The entire New Testament is composed of the letters in the divine and heavenly alphabet, letters which are actually the Triune God Himself
Some readers may be wondering what it means to compose something with the Triune God as the letters of the alphabet
We need to know that the church does not come into existence through anything other than the dispensing of the Triune God into the believers
The church addressed in this Epistle is a local church, a church in a city, not the church in a region or a street
The church in Corinth was constituted of the universal God, but it existed in Corinth, a definite locality on earth
It also indicates that this Epistle was intended not only for the believers in the church in Corinth, but for all believers in every place
The words 'theirs and ours' used by Paul in 1:2 indicate that Christ, as the all-inclusive One, belongs to all believers
As an illustration of the fact that the church comes out from God, we may say that children are of their parents
In a similar way, the church is the produce that comes out from God, for all the members of the church have been born of God
Just as there cannot be a human family without human birth, so there cannot be a church, which is a divine family, without the divine birth
Certain denominations, the so-called holiness people, practice a kind of holiness that is of the school of sinless perfection
These denominations may require their members to obey certain regulations in order to be regarded as practicing holiness
Using Matthew 23:19, these teachers proved that, according to the words of the Lord Jesus, the altar sanctifies the sacrifice
Doctrinally speaking, these Bible teachers defeated the teaching that holiness is a matter of sinless perfection
These Bible teachers also appealed to 1 Timothy 4:4-5, which says that food is sanctified by the prayer of the saints
When the food is placed on the saints' dining table and is prayed over by the saints, the food is sanctified by their prayer
The sanctification revealed in the Bible includes dispositional transformation in addition to positional change
The condition of the church in Corinth was poor, and this book describes the negative things that were among the Corinthians
God has put us into Christ, and this makes it possible for us to experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
We are washed from sinful things; second, we are sanctified, separated unto God; and third, we are justified, accepted, by God
Because God has put us into Christ, Christ's Spirit has entered into us and has become the sanctifying Spirit within us
We may use the simple process of making a cup of tea as an illustration of the sanctifying work of the Spirit of God
The churchs existence depends on God as the source Christ as the sphere and element and the Spirit as the application with the divine nature
In this message we shall go on to consider the dispensing work of the Divine Trinity with respect to the church
In 27 Paul says But we speak Gods wisdom in a mystery the wisdom which has been hidden which God predestined before the ages for our glory
Whenever our situation affords God the opportunity to dispense Himself into us, He will do this work of dispensing
Sometimes when we are very discouraged and feel that the situation is hopeless, we see in the churches some signs of growth
If we compare these saints today with what they were many years ago, we would see that with them there has been the definite growth in life
In 1:9 Paul says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
God has called us into such a fellowship so that we may partake of Christ and enjoy Him as our God-given portion
To be called into the fellowship of God's Son actually means to be called into the participation and enjoyment of Christ
Eventually, our enjoyment of Christ will be put together, and the aggregate of all that we have enjoyed of Him will be glory
We need to learn how to remain in the fellowship of Gods Son that is how to remain in the enjoyment of Christ in the participation of Him
From the standpoint of our position as the result of God's working, we have been transferred into Christ, and now we are in Christ
God is continually seeking to dispense something of Christ into our being so that we may be transferred into Christ more and more
The extent to which He has dispensed Himself into us is the degree to which He has transferred us into Christ experientially
Corinthians 1:24 says, 'But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God's power and God's wisdom'
If we turn to our spirit, calling on the Lord's name, immediately Christ will be transmitted as power from God to us
We need to be reminded to turn from the outward situation, the difficulty or problem in our environment, and come back to our spirit
Only Christ as the power to us from God can enable us to bear our problems or be carried through a difficult situation
In 130 Paul says But of Him you are in Christ Jesus who became wisdom to us from God both righteousness and sanctification and redemption
In our experience Christ should also be the hidden mysteries, mysteries that we cannot define but that we can experience
For God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God'
We cannot separate Christ from the Spirit in our spirit, for He is the pneumatic Christ, the life-giving Spirit
We may think that the revealing to us of the things of Christ is simply a matter of vision, a matter of the Spirit showing us something
If we do not have the divine dispensing, anything the Spirit reveals to us will be nothing more than doctrine to us
Of trying to handle the situation in an outward way, you inwardly turn to your spirit and enjoy Christ as power to you from God
At such a time you will have the sense deep within that the Triune God is dispensing Himself in Christ through the Spirit into your being
In 316 we see that the Spirit dwells in the church Do you not know that you are a temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you
To say that the Spirit of God dwells in the believers as a temple of God means that the Spirit of God dwells in the church
Although we cannot explain it adequately, we know from experience that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit
Many Christians may not even know that there is a verse in the Scriptures telling us that we are one spirit with the Lord
All these verses indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation-the principle of God and man, man and God, becoming one
He pointed out that according to 1 Corinthians 7 Paul wrote certain things even though he did not have the commandment of the Lord
Growth is through the planting and watering of God's fellow-workers and with the essence of God, who gives the growth
Transformation is through the builders' building work and by the indwelling Spirit with the divine essence and element
Apart from the dispensing of the divine life into our being, we never could have experienced the divine birth, a spiritual birth
As we shall see, the divine life in us will grow, will increase, through the continuation of the divine dispensing
The Corinthians were paying more attention to them than they were to God Himself who is the source of their growth in life
In 4:15 he even tells them that he is their spiritual father, the one who begot them in Christ through the gospel
In 3:7 Paul continues, 'So that neither is the one who plants anything nor the one who waters, but the One who makes to grow, God'
As far as the growth in life is concerned, all the ministers of Christ, whether planters or waterers, are nothing, but God is everything
In chapter three of 1 Corinthians, Paul was trying to turn the philosophical Greek believers from mental knowledge to life in the spirit
Paul says that, with respect to the growth in life, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything
In verse 8 Paul says, 'Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labor'
What a privilege and a glory that men can be God's fellow-workers, working together with God on His farm to grow Christ!
The building of God, the house of God, the church, is the increase of Christ, the enlargement of Christ in His unlimitedness
Now, through the dispensing of the divine life into the saints, the measure of Christ in that church has increased
In Matthew 16:18 the Lord says that He will build His church; yet here Paul says that he is a builder, even a wise master builder
The church, the house of God, must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, materials produced from Christ growing in us
Each of us, including every member of the Body, must take heed how he builds, that is, with what material he builds
In verse 11 Paul says, 'For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ'
As the Christ and the Son of the living God, the Lord Jesus Christ is the unique foundation laid by God for the building of the church
Verse 12 continues, 'But if anyone builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble'
The first group includes gold, silver, and precious stones; the second group includes wood, grass, and stubble
They were not like the apostles, who built with their excellent knowledge of Christ and rich experiences of Him
Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God
All these precious materials are the products of our participation in Christ and enjoyment of Him in our spirit through the Holy Spirit
The proper materials for the building up of the church are gold, silver, and precious stones, all of which are minerals
We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life, as revealed in 2 Corinthians 3:18 and Romans 12:2
We have indicated that in Paul's word in these verses from 1 Corinthians 3 the thought of transformation is implied
When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done
In this way we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence
Concerning this renewing Paul says in Romans 12:2, 'Do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
Grass may be in contrast to silver and may signify the fallen man, the man of the flesh , not redeemed by Christ
All these worthless materials are the product of the believers' natural man together with what they have collected from their background
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit of God entered into us to impart God's life, eternal life, into our being
If the receiving of the divine life through regeneration were not a reality, then our believing in the Lord Jesus would be vanity
Whenever we contact our Lord, the Triune God, through the exercise of our spirit, the indwelling Spirit imparts more life into our being
Just as a person dies when his blood stops circulating, so we experience spiritual death when the divine life stops circulating within us
Do you know the reason so many Christians are spiritually dead, the reason they do not have the divine life flowing in them?
Because the divine Spirit is with our regenerated spirit, when we exercise our spirit, the Spirit of God flows within us
The making of petrified wood is a good illustration of the process of transformation through the flowing of the divine life
By the way of implication Paul tells us in chapter three of 1 Corinthians that through growth plants can become minerals
The one spirit in 1 Corinthians 6:17 is the mingled spirit, our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit
Stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him'
In the sight of God three aspects of His first creation are especially important: the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit
As we have said a number of times, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man with his spirit is for God
Regeneration takes place in the human spirit by the Holy Spirit of God with God's life, the uncreated eternal life
Elsewhere in the New Testament the divine Spirit is called the Spirit of life , the life-giving Spirit , and even the seven Spirits
Through incarnation God actually became a man, and then lived on earth as a man for thirty-three and a half years
It would be ridiculous to say that only one third of God is Spirit and that the other two thirds are not Spirit
Today some claim that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not only distinct, but are also three separate Persons
Those who hold to this concept may say that only the Spirit is Spirit and that the Father and the Son are not Spirit
The entire God is Spirit, and the Spirit as the Third of the Trinity is God reaching us for our experience and enjoyment of Him
Christians also know that the Lord Jesus is our Redeemer, Savior, Lord, and Master, the One who died for our sins
Not many Christians have seen from 1 Corinthians 15:45 that the last Adam, the Lord Jesus, has become a life-giving Spirit
If the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 is different from the Holy Spirit who gives life, then there are two Spirits who give life
It is heretical to say that in addition to the life-giving Spirit, Christ in resurrection has become another kind of Spirit who gives life
In Darby's New Translation, verses 7 through 16 of 2 Corinthians 3 are in parentheses, showing that verse 17 is the continuation of verse 6
When the Spirit reaches us, the Father and the Son also reach us, because the Three of the Godhead cannot be divided or separated
He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
Corinthians 15:45 reveals that through resurrection and in resurrection Christ has become a life-giving Spirit
The Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17, as in verses 16 and 18, undoubtedly refers to the Lord Jesus, not to God the Father
According to the Scriptures, we believe that our Triune God is the all-inclusive Spirit dwelling in our spirit and mingled with our spirit
The more we pray by exercising our spirit, the more we have the sense deep within that we are being saturated with the Triune God
The dispensing of the Triune God into us causes us to be members of the church who are growing and being transformed
Through the divine dispensing we have received our divine birth, and through this dispensing we have growth and enjoy transformation
In 12:1-14:40 Paul deals with the problem of spiritual gifts in relation to God's administration and operation
The apostle's thought here is that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless
No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, 'Jesus is accursed'; he would like to say, and he is able to say, 'Lord Jesus'
In 12:2 Paul tells the Corinthians, 'You know that when you were of the nations, you were led away to dumb idols, however you were led'
When Christians today talk about spiritual gifts, they usually have in mind the gifts of speaking in tongues, healing, and miracles
You at least have some amount of spiritual riches and you need to spend what you have by speaking forth the Lord in the meetings
The fact that we speak freely outside the meetings is a strong indication that we are also able to speak in the meetings
Surely all the saints, from the youngest to the oldest, can speak these four words, especially in the meetings
Would it not be wonderful if a sister would say, 'O Lord,' the husband replied, 'Amen,' and the children responded, 'Hallelujah'!
In the church meetings all the saints, especially the young ones and the new ones, can speak for the Lord in a simple way
After this, another young one may rise up and say, 'I want to testify to you all that the name of Jesus is so sweet'
Verse 3 says when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say 'Lord Jesus,' exalting Jesus as Lord
In verse 6 Paul says, 'And there are distributions of operations, but the same God, who is operating all things in all'
In 12:4-6 the gifts are by the Spirit; the ministries, the services, are for the Lord; and the operations are of God
The more we speak by exercising our spirit, the more the Spirit will function, the Lord will minister, and God will operate
Because the Spirit is joined to our regenerated human spirit, whenever we speak these wonderful matters, the Spirit will function
The functions of the members are the spiritual gifts, and these gifts are related to speaking in the Spirit of God
We have seen that when we exercise our spirit to speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God operates
We have heard much concerning the Lord Jesus, God's salvation, grace, redemption, justification, sanctification, and many other matters
In a similar way, we should not despise our speaking, for it may cause many others to be set on fire in the Spirit
We need to be impressed with the fact that when we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord serves, and God works
If we do this, we shall have the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issuing in the functions of the members in a local church
When we speak, the switch is turned on, and the divine dispensing, the flowing of the divine electricity, takes place
As a result, the divine dispensing will take place in the church meetings, and all the members will be infused with the Triune God
All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit; that is, the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts
The manifestation of the Spirit is for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of Christ's Body
Verse 8 says, 'For to one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit'
The word of wisdom is mainly of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching
The first manifestation of the Spirit listed by Paul is the word of wisdom, and the second is the word of knowledge
During this period of training, perhaps only a half hour in length, we can learn the truth and also practice presenting the truth
When we have much utterance that comes from knowing the truth, we shall be able to speak for hours concerning the biblical truths
In 1963 and 1964 there were so-called prophecies that claimed that the city of Los Angeles would fall into the ocean
In chapters twelve and fourteen of 1 Corinthians the noun 'prophecy' and the verb 'prophesy' are used a number of times
If we read these chapters carefully, we shall see that here Paul does not use these words mainly with the meaning of predict or foretell
Many of us can testify of the help we have received through the kind of prophesying that speaks for Christ and speaks forth Christ
As someone is prophesying by speaking forth Christ and speaking for Christ, we are under the dispensing of the Triune God
Our speaking provides the best opportunity for the Spirit to function, for the Lord to serve, and for God to work
We all need to learn to speak so that there may be in all the church meetings the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
Tongues in verse 10 denote a proper language or dialect either of men or of angels , not meaningless voices or sounds
The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit
Some say that speaking in tongues is first the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit, but afterwards becomes a gift of the Spirit
Although Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers is of more than nine items
The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life
Corinthians 14:4 and 5 say, 'He who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but he who prophesies builds up the church
To prophesy, to speak for the Lord and speak forth the Lord, builds up not only the individual saints, but also the church
In 1412 Paul goes on to say So also you since you are zealots of spiritual gifts seek that you may abound to the building up of the church
Their problem with spiritual gifts was due to their self-seeking, to their not caring for the building up of the church
In dealing with problems in the realm of the divine administration, he emphasizes the church as God's unique goal for us
The apostle's completing ministry comprises Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
Corinthians 1211 and 12 say But the one and the same Spirit operates all these things distributing to each one individually as He purposes
For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ'
Verse 11 says that one Spirit operates all the various aspects of His manifestation, distributing them to many believers individually
Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ
Corinthians 12:24 says, 'God has tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to the member that lacked'
We need much transformation , from the natural life to the spiritual, by the same Spirit, for the practical Body life
The placing of the gifts in the church and the tempering of the Body are matters of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
As we have strongly emphasized, this dispensing involves the Trinity, and it takes place through our cooperation
In 15:4 Paul continues, 'And that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures'
In verse 20 Paul says, 'But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep'
Chapter fifteen reveals not only that Christ died for our sins, that He was buried, and that He was resurrected to become the firstfruit
In 1 Corinthians 15:57 Paul declares, 'But thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ'
The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity will take place continually, and the church will receive the benefit
In 1:9 Paul says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
To say that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son means that He has called us into the enjoyment of His Son
Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
Just as something may be put into water and then soak in the water, we have been put into Christ so that we may 'soak' in Christ
For this purpose, He has put us into this 'electricity' and now is making this electricity our wisdom and power
When the Spirit functions as the unveiling Spirit, the Spirit removes the veils, the covers, that keep us from seeing Christ as our portion
In chapter two of 1 Corinthians, the Spirit is not only the unveiling Spirit but also the communicating Spirit
The emphasis is not on the person to whom the speaking is addressed, but rather on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken
God is dispensing Himself into us as life so that we may grow in life and be transformed into precious materials for God's building
In previous messages we have emphasized the fact that when we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers, and God operates
We need to speak the Lord, speak the Bible, speak God's salvation, and speak all manner of things concerning the Christian life
As we shall see, according to this book, the divine dispensing issues in the maturity of life and constitution of ministry
The Epistle of 2 Corinthians is more experiential, more subjective, and deeper than the Epistle of 1 Corinthians
In 2 Corinthians, Christ, the Spirit with our spirit, and the church are further developed, but the gifts are not even mentioned
The purpose of the ministry is to minister Christ whom we have experienced; the gifts are mostly to teach the doctrines concerning Christ
Chapters one and two of 2 Corinthians unveil a victorious life for maturity and a triumphant ministry for God's purpose
In a similar way, we all have received the divine life, a spiritual life, and with this life there is at least some amount of function
The word rendered 'encouragement' is different from the word for comfort or consolation and has the sense of cheer
In our reading of the Bible, we should not take verses such as 1:3 and 4 for granted, assuming that we understand them
The divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity can be compared to the flow of electricity from the power plant into our homes
As the appliances operate, they continually receive the flowing, the dispensing, of electrical power into them
Through their experience of being encouraged through the divine dispensing, they had the riches with which to comfort others
As the apostles were comforting the saints, they were dispensing into them the riches of the Triune God that they themselves were enjoying
In 15 Paul goes on to say Because even as the sufferings of the Christ abound unto us so through the Christ our encouragement also abounds
The apostles participated in the sufferings of such a Christ, and through such a Christ they received encouragement
In 1:3-5 Paul seems to be saying, 'We were in affliction, but the God of all encouragement comforted us by dispensing Himself into us
Because we have experienced the divine riches, we can dispense the Triune God into others who are suffering for the Lord's sake
We enjoy the divine dispensing, and we also dispense into you the divine riches for your comfort and encouragement
It is by the divine dispensing of the divine riches that the believers, including the apostles, grow toward maturity
For whatever promises of God there are, in Him is the Yes; wherefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us'
Christ, whom the faithful God promised and whom the sincere apostles preached, did not become yes and no; that is, He did not change
When we say Amen before God to the fact that Christ is the Yes the fulfillment of all the promises of God this is a glory to God through us
As the anointed One, Christ has the abundance of the rich Spirit, for He has been anointed by the compound Spirit
God attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, connecting the apostles and the believers to Christ, the anointed One
Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God
At the time we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God
The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God's image signified by the seal, thus making us like God
In the purchase of land in ancient times, the seller would give the buyer some soil from that land as a sample
We not only receive the element and substance of the divine life, but we also receive the essence of the divine life
Paul used this metaphor to illustrate how Christ is the victorious general and how Paul and all believers are His captives
Their move in their ministry for Christ is like a triumphal procession from one place to another under God's leading
As conquered and captured ones in the train of Christ's triumph, Paul and his co-workers celebrated and participated in Christ's triumph
The apostles were such incense-bearers in the ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph
Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this
To some, to those who are God's chosen ones, this fragrance will be life; however, to others this fragrance will be death
Whenever we speak Christ to others, we need to realize that our speaking is the spreading of the sweet fragrance of Christ
The apostles were a fragrance of Christ to God because they were saturated and permeated by Christ and with Christ
When they spoke to others, the very Christ of whom they were constituted spread Himself forth out from their being
When they spoke, the Christ of whom they were constituted came forth as a sweet fragrance to God for His enjoyment
From experience we know that whenever we give a genuine testimony for the Lord, we are the first to enjoy this testimony
We also know what it is like inwardly when we do not obey the inner sense to speak for the Lord in the meeting
Many readers of the Bible pay close attention to the book of 1 Corinthians but not nearly as much attention to the book of 2 Corinthians
Paul was a captive of Christ, one captured, subdued, and fully gained by Christ and then put into His train of victorious procession
We shall always be conscious of the fact that we have been captured by Christ, subdued by Him, and gained by Him
He knows that now he is one of those marching in the train of the victorious procession of the one who has captured him
Often after a Roman general had won a victory in battle, he would return to the capital leading a train of captives
Because we are captives in Christ's triumphal procession, we are also incense-bearers, those who scatter incense wherever we go
Because we have been captured, subdued, possessed, and gained by Christ, He has the liberty to saturate us with His fragrance
These letters are composed with the Spirit of the living God, with the life-imparting and life-dispensing Spirit
While we are beholding and reflecting, we are being transformed by the divine dispensing of the divine element into our inner being
In 4:7 Paul says, 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
These vessels may be compared to a camera, into which the image of Christ enters through the illumination of God's shining
The reason Paul uses metaphors in 2 Corinthians is that the things he is ministering to us are very rich, deep, and experiential
We need to have the consciousness that we are captives of Christ and also His incense-bearers, those bearing Him as incense
We need to consider these metaphors again and again, for they illustrate things that are deep, profound, and experiential
Now God is seeking to spread His life from our spirit, the center of our being, into our soul and even into our body
God has wrought His life into our spirit as the hub and now He is spreading this life through the spokes of the soul to the rim of the body
We should not think that we only need the constitution of life and do not need the constitution of the ministry
In these chapters of 2 Corinthians, we see not only the matter of constitution but also the matter of transformation
When we speak of constitution, we speak of the process of spiritual metabolism that affects us intrinsically by a divine life-replacement
When wood is petrified, it undergoes a change as the old element is carried away and is replaced by a new element
As Paul was writing these three chapters of 2 Corinthians, he had within him the thoughts of constitution and transformation
In these three chapters of 2 Corinthians Paul is seeking to portray the dispensing of the divine element into our tripartite being
A letter of Christ does not mean a letter written by Christ; rather, this letter is a composition that uses Christ as the alphabet
All believers of Christ should be such living letters of Christ so that others may read and know Christ in their being
In verse 3 Paul says that a letter of Christ is not inscribed with ink, but inscribed with the Spirit of the living God
Some of the saints may think that because they are not apostles, they cannot participate in writing a living letter of Christ
We have seen that in chapter two Paul uses the metaphors of captives in Christ's triumphal procession and incense-bearers scattering incense
Suppose a brother who has little experience of the gospel tries to convince a fellow worker that there is only one God
The brother is defeated by this unbeliever because his preaching of the gospel is a preaching without the experience of the gospel
Let us also suppose that this same brother tries to tell another colleague at work that Jesus Christ is the Savior
Suppose a brother with a considerable amount of experience of God and Christ speaks to a fellow worker concerning God
He may give him a testimony of his experience and of how he came to believe in God and receive Christ as his Savior
There is no need for you to preach to your fellow workers by saying, 'Everyone is a sinner, and you are not an exception
Our preaching of the gospel depends on how much we have experienced of the Lord and how much we have enjoyed Him
If we have experienced and enjoyed the Lord to a considerable degree, we shall surely have a sufficient measure of life
The experiential preaching of the gospel based on our enjoyment of the Lord is actually the testimony of a witness
For this reason, in chapter two of 2 Corinthians he portrays himself as a captive in Christ's triumphal procession
In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul changes the metaphor from that of captives and incense-bearers to that of a letter writer
In addition to being a captive and a bearer of incense, Paul was also one who wrote upon those who received his ministry
Preaching the gospel without the adequate measure of life and experience may be compared to trying to write with a pen that has no ink
If we speak something that is according to our experience, we shall realize that while we are speaking the ink of the Spirit is flowing
As those who would compose letters of Christ, we do not use mere theological knowledge or philosophy as the elements of our composition
In the meetings, as we give a testimony or offer a prayer, we may write Christ upon others with the ink of the Spirit
With respect to the one being written upon, it is a matter of constituting, a constituting that takes place through the divine dispensing
As we have seen, this experiential preaching is your writing of Christ into that person with the Spirit as the ink
After a period of time, a particular constitution will be built up in that person, and then he will be ready to be saved
The Greek words rendered 'made us sufficient' may also be translated 'enabled us,' 'qualified us,' 'made us competent'
God made the apostles competent, sufficient, as ministers of the new covenant, not of letter but of the Spirit who gives life
The apostolic ministry for the New Testament is not of dead letters like the Mosaic ministry for the Old Testament
His speaking to his colleagues about the Lord should not be a speaking apart from such a constitution of the Spirit
In his speaking he should give a testimony of what he has experienced of the Spirit, of how the Spirit has constituted him
Whenever we give this kind of testimony, we are ministering the new covenant, which is constituted of the Spirit
We shall be ministers not of letter, doctrine, or theology; instead, we shall be ministers of the living Spirit, writing Christ into others
For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory'
The ministry in verse 8 is the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life
The ministry of the old covenant became one of death , because the old covenant brought in condemnation unto death
The ministry of the new covenant is one of the Spirit who gives life, because the new covenant brings in God's righteousness unto life
In 3:8 and 9 we see that God has constituted the ministry of the Spirit in glory and of righteousness abounding in glory
When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was zealous for the law and for Judaism, and he was absolutely opposed to Christ
Because Paul was such a dispenser, his ministry was a ministry of the Spirit in glory and a ministry of righteousness abounding in glory
In chapter three of 2 Corinthians the Lord is the liberating Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, and the transforming Spirit
Which giveth life, verse six, meaning, 'the Lord', as here spoken of, 'Christ', 'is the Spirit', is identical with the Holy Spirit:
In verse 17 Paul first tells us that the Lord is the Spirit, and then he goes on to speak of the Spirit of the Lord
The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the Triune God, was 'not yet' in John 7:39, because at that time Jesus was not yet glorified
According to verse 18, with an unveiled face we are beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord
When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done
The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence
We are being conformed to the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ ; we are being made the same as He is
Such an all-inclusive Spirit is crucial to the ministers of Christ and to their ministry for God's New Testament economy
After speaking about the ministry of the new covenant, Paul continues to speak about the ministers of the new covenant
The illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ's gospel known to us issues from the shining of God in our hearts
In understanding Pauls word in 46 we may regard illumination as equal to light and speak of the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ
When our speaking is with the Spirit and with light, the Spirit and the light will accomplish the work of dispensing
The scattering of the incense, the working of the Spirit, and the shining of the light are all for the divine dispensing
In 4:7 Paul says, 'But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
God's shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything
The permeating of the incense, the working of the Spirit, and the shining of the light all produce Christ in us
In 416 Paul says Wherefore we do not lose heart but if indeed our outward man is decaying yet our inward man is being renewed day by day
By the continued killing, the working of death, our outward man, that is, our material body with its animating soul , is being consumed
In chapter four, with the consuming of the outward man and the renewing of the inward man, we have a yet more advanced stage
The believers are a new creation , not according to the old nature of the flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life
Because Paul had been transfused and permeated with Christ, in his ministry he could write living letters of Christ
He could dispense Christ through his ministry into others, for he had been infused with Christ to the uttermost
These Epistles reveal a wonderful divine matter: the Triune God dispensing His very essence into our tripartite being
God has called us into such a fellowship so that we may partake of Christ and enjoy Him as our God-given portion
Let us suppose, as an illustration, that you are reading a book that describes a particular machine and how it operates
If you do not have any knowledge of that machine, you may have little understanding of what you read concerning it
Because he has a knowledge of the machine, he can easily take in what is written in the book about that machine
Because certain matters in the Scriptures seem to fit in with our natural concepts, we respond immediately when we read them
As electricity is transmitted from the power plant to a building, so Christ is continually transmitted into us from God to be our wisdom
Electricity is not given by the power plant to the building; it is continually transmitted from the power plant to the building
There is the need for a continual attachment in order to have the continual flowing of the current of electricity
In order to receive this continual transmission of Christ as wisdom, we need to keep ourselves attached to Him
As the dispensing of electricity should be a continual matter, so the dispensing of Christ as wisdom should be also a continual matter
In this salvation our entire being-spirit, soul, and body-becomes organically one with Christ, and Christ becomes everything to us
We should not regard the righteousness, sanctification, and redemption spoken of in 1 Corinthians 1:30 simply as objective matters
The very elements of righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are being transmitted into us in a subjective way
As the result of this transmission, Christ becomes to us a living and subjective righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
Contrary to what we may have been taught in the past, there is no need for us to reckon Christ to be our righteousness
Christ is being transmitted into us as our living righteousness and also as our living sanctification and redemption
In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, 'But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God'
Our daily righteousness, sanctification, redemption and also our practical function in the church meetings come from the divine transmission
Because we experience such an inner transmission taking place day by day, we are anointed by the Spirit, 'oiled' by Him
For if the ministry of condemnation came in glory, much rather the ministry of righteousness abounds in glory'
In verse 8 we have the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life
According to our understanding, the gospel was preached by or through the apostles, just as the law was given through Moses
In 1:21 we see that God has attached us, the apostles and believers, unto Christ as the source of the anointing
In giving the law, God only had to call Moses to the mountaintop, prepare the stone tablets, and give them to Moses
As Paul became attached to Christ, the anointed One, the 'painted' One, we may say that he also became 'painted' with the divine ointment
Saul was sealed with the Spirit, and he experienced the pledge of the Spirit in his heart as a guarantee and foretaste
As an illustration of what it means to be sealed with the Spirit, we may use the example of applying ink to a sheet of paper
While Moses was with the Lord on the mountain receiving the law, he also received some amount of the divine dispensing
As Paul points out in 2 Corinthians 3 and 4, with Moses the shining was only on his skin, but with us the shining is in our heart
Because of the glory of the new covenant ministry , the temporary glory of the ministry of the law disappeared and no longer existed
In the heart is related to the inner life, whereas on the skin of the face has nothing to do with the inner life
The illumination that makes the glory of Christ's gospel known to us issues from the shining of God in our heart
They are able to exalt Christ as the Lord in their preaching and conduct themselves as slaves to the believers in their service
We may say that the fire dispenses itself into the iron so that the iron becomes permeated by and with the fire
As a result, we have the intense desire to minister the word of God to others so that they also may experience the divine dispensing
As we have pointed out, Paul uses other metaphors in chapters two and three to describe the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity
It is also different from mere doctrine and teaching and from efforts to improve ourselves or adjust ourselves
What is revealed in these books is the transfusing, the dispensing, the permeating, the saturating, of the Triune God in our being
In this message we shall consider further the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity through the believers' enjoyment of the Triune God
It is common in so-called Christian services for the minister to use 13:14 as a benediction at the close of a service
We also need to be impressed with the fact that in 13:14 love, grace, and fellowship are not three separate matters
Love is the source, grace is the expression of the source, and fellowship is the transmission of the expression
While we enjoy the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
We should not think that we successively enjoy the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit
In the same principle, it will be grace to others if we are willing to sacrifice our material wealth for their sakes
Sufferings and trials are often in the Lord's ordination for us that we may experience Christ as grace and power
The pouring out of the love of God into our hearts is not merely a matter of feeling; rather, it is a matter of the essence of God
Because something of the divine essence has been poured out into our hearts, the heart of every Christian is a heart of love
Because we have been regenerated, we have the loving essence within us, even if we are temporarily angry about something
In 2 Corinthians 1 we have the Holy Spirit as the anointing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, and as the pledge in our hearts
Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are automatically anointed with Him by God
We should not pray in the sense of asking God for so many things; instead, we should pray in the sense of staying with God
If we stay with the Father through prayer, we shall experience not only the love of God but also the grace of Christ
As we stay with the Father of love, enjoying the abounding grace of the Lord, we shall also be in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
We shall have the sense deep within that something is flowing in us, even that the Holy Spirit is flowing in us
While we are remaining with the Father as the source, we should not pray in a way that will distract us from Him
When the Lord was with His disciples, as recorded in the four Gospels, there is no indication that they prayed to Him in a religious way
