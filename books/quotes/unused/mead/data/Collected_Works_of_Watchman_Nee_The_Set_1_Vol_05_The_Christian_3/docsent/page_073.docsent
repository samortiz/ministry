   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>However, the Lord's knocking here is only for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church has been forsaken by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now it is no more the church opening the door.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"If anyone hears My voice and opens the door."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is outside knocking at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If there is a heart inside the door that is not engrossed by the surrounding people and will open its door, that heart shall be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, this is an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the Lord cannot do what He wants to do, He can always do what He can do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though He is forsaken by the group as a whole, He knocks on every individual door.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the majority has not allowed Him to be the Head over everything, He comes to seek out individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although the door of the church cannot be open, the door of the individuals may be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"If anyone."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The corporate whole had rejected Him according to their self-will, but He is not despairing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"If anyone" perhaps there will be one or two.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord is seeking out individuals in Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not wishfully expect that the whole of Laodicea will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, there may be some individuals who are willing to turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"My sheep hear My voice," but many of the sheep have lost their sheep nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, there are not many who can hear the voice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are too many voices: the voice of their own opinion, the voice of the world, and the voice of the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no time to hear the Lord's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even if they hear the voice, they still have to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The bride heard the voice already but because of her laziness, she did not open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is there not anyone who hears the Lord's voice today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a pity that many have indeed heard it and have realized that they should allow Christ to be their life and that they should fully submit to Him, but because of the holding back of their companions, they do not act according to the Lord's will in their daily living and matters related to the church's stand.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there is another meaning to "stand at the door and knock."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is related to the second coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here the Lord's second coming is closer than that mentioned in any other letter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only is He coming, He is also standing at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It seems that He is standing at the door and trying hard to wake up His half-asleep bride.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet those who are His still do not realize that He is at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The lord of the evil servant "will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know" Luke 12:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If anyone sincerely opens the door, he will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord said, "I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Of course, this refers to the time the righteous will resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They will feast together in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time, they will enjoy the blessing of the Lord on them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, the Lord "will come in to him."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not in to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is in to those believers who open the door, and not to Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The destiny of Laodicea is sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord is bestowing grace upon individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>An individual believer cannot open the door for the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a personal matter to submit to the Lord and to receive Him as the personal Lord of one's life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Anyone who receives the Lord as the Lord of his life, He will enter into him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here the Lord is separating from a condemned church everyone who has a heart for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, we should not sit back and say that there is no hope for the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord is still knocking!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although the whole will not submit to the Lord, some individuals will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How then can we expect the whole church to be revived?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is a groundless, vain hope.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord is expecting only individuals who want to see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not be pessimistic.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Neither be optimistic!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What does He do after He enters in?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is going to dine with him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This has some spiritual significance for the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord will dine with all those who open the door; they will fellowship with the Lord, know the things of the Lord, and be in complete union with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>"I...with him" the Lord sympathizes with the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He wants to bear all his burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He wants to commend him for all his laborings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He wants to share with him in all his earthly endeavors, in difficulties, in tears, worries, and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"I...with him" the Lord wants to join Himself to all who are the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord wants the believers to know that He fully understands them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He treasures and feels all the sentiments the believers have, all their heart's desire aroused by the Lord, and all their reactions to things around them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Is this all?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is more!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>"I...with him" believers and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Not only does the Lord know all the things that are of the believers, but the believers will know all the things that are of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord is pleased to see His children's hearts communicating with His desires.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To dine with him means to share his thoughts, feelings, joys, and difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Such a fellowship, acquaintance, and trust can only be possessed by friends, not servants.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>"No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all the things which I have heard from My Father I have made known to you" John 15:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Those who can share with Jesus in His thoughts are His friends.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Those who are willing to open their door will be rewarded with this.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Any saint who opens his door will have a chance to fellowship with Christ's love and desires.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>"I...with him and he with Me" this is mutual; it is the peak of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Brothers, is it not true that we desire to have closer fellowship with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do we desire to have unceasing fellowship with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Would we not be elated if the Lord would take our desires as His desires?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Would it not be wonderful if we had the right to access what is stored within the Lord's heart?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Such is a living of "I...dine with him and he with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>How can we have this kind of living?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is no other way but to listen to His voice, to open the door to receive Him in, and to let Him be the Lord over our all.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Is any point in your living a closed door to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Is there something in you that is autonomous and not open to the Lord's interference?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the reason you cannot have a full union with the Lord and close fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you are willing to open up every door, to fully submit to the Lord, to fully obey Him without exception, you will have the experience of dining with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Anyone who is willing to open his door to the Lord will dine with Him in spirit in this age and will dine with Him in the kingdom in the next age.</S>
