Beginning in August of 1988, the Lord has been speaking to us concerning His organic Body and the organic building up of His Body
The divine revelation of the New Testament was fully completed with Paul's ministry and John's mending ministry
The New Testament tells us that at the end of Paul's ministry, the church began to degrade and become deformed from the divine revelation
Eventually, at the time of the Reformation with Martin Luther, the recovery of the Lord came into a definite form
The Lord went on in the eighteenth century with Zinzendorf to recover the initial stage of the church life in the unity of the Holy Spirit
Mainland China was lost into the hands of the communists, who were absolutely against the Lord's interests on this earth
From that time to 1958 on the island of Taiwan, we basically kept what we had seen and received of the Lord through Brother Nee's ministry
From 1958 to 1989, at least ten big divine items have been recovered as a continuation of the Lord's recovery in the years before
The eighth item is that the riches of Christ after being enjoyed by the saints become the fullness of Christ for His expression
Through century after century the Lord has been recovering item after item, and He is still going on among us today
In August of 1988 the Lord passed on the words organic and organism to us in order to advance His recovery even further
Paul tells us that the church is built up with precious materials, and among these precious materials are the precious stones
We can illustrate the difference between an inorganic item and something organic by comparing a piece of wood to a person's finger
If a piece of wood is cut in half, and the pieces are put together without any glue, they will remain separate
If a person's finger is cut in half, and a doctor puts the two pieces together, they will grow together because they are organic
The old, traditional, and unscriptural way is good for organization but not for the organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ
Some older co-workers were a success in the recovery according to the old way, but now the old way is being annulled
The difference between an organization and an organism can be illustrated by comparing a robot to our physical body
A robot is an organization of inorganic parts, but our human body, which typifies the Body of Christ, is altogether organic
The organic building up of the Body of Christ is not only by the gifted persons but also by every member of the Body
We must admit that in many of the local churches, the building up has been mostly by the elders and the co-workers, the leading ones
We may say that we do not agree with the clergylaity system and that among us in the Lords recovery we do not have the class of the clergy
In his epistle to the church in Ephesus in the book of Revelation, the Lord revealed that He hates the clergy-laity system
In the present advance of the Lord's recovery, He also desires to recover the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ
If we only had people who were college graduates and we did not have plumbers electricians and secretaries what would our economy be like
Many saints have been in the church life for many years, but today they know very little because they were only edified in a general way
The Lord desires to recover the perfecting of the common members of the Body of Christ, and this perfecting can take place in the homes
We have to meet as the church in the way that is revealed in 1 Corinthians 14:26- 'Whenever you come together, each one has
If we know that a certain brother is going to give a message, there is no need for us to get prepared to speak
In the church meeting in mutuality, each attendant has a portion of the riches of Christ to share with others mutually
We have to pray, get into the Word, have our mind and spirit exercised, and have our voice exercised to share in the meetings
We should hate to go to a meeting as 'pew members' without any exercise, to merely listen, watch, and enjoy others' sharing
Without the fulfillment of Matthew 16:18, Ephesians 4:11-16, and 1 Corinthians 14:26, the Lord cannot come back
Now that we have seen a bird's-eye view of the Lord's present recovery, we want to see the life needed for the Lord's present recovery
In the Old Testament, the highest requirement was the law, but in the New Testament the requirement of the kingdom is much higher
If we are going to meet the need of the Lord's present recovery, the requirement must be the requirement of the kingdom
The present recovery of the Lord is the recovery of the kingdom life, a life that matches the requirements of the kingdom
We may have avoided the word devote in the past because it has been spoiled by being used in a light and loose way
We may give, offer, present, or consecrate ourselves to God in a light way, but we cannot devote ourselves to God in a light way
The president of the United States may be merciful, kind, loving, humble, and approachable, yet he is not a low or common person
In dealing with His people in the Old Testament, God set up a pattern that we must deal with Him in a serious way by a vow
The Greek word for 'constrains' literally means to shut up to one line and purpose as in a narrow, walled road
After man's creation, God put him not before one tree but before two trees, indicating that God respects man's freedom of choice
Deep in God's heart, He desires man to choose the proper tree, but whether or not man chooses this tree depends upon his choice
We have to admit that most of the time we live a life for the Lord while unconsciously living a life to ourselves
Because we have been constrained by the Lord's love, we have no freedom, no choice, so we have to devote ourselves to Him
Our natural birth is also something in uncleanness, and whatever comes out of our natural being is dirty and contagious
To devote ourselves to the Lord, we have to make a thorough confession of all our sins and trespasses, and we have to 'pray through'
When we are speaking the gospel to someone, our speaking should stop at a certain point and we should guide them into prayer
Good salesmen are trained not to speak to people with their own words but with the words that their company trained them to speak
Since Paul preached the gospel in all wisdom, as an apostle he surely perfected the saints to do the same thing
For us to be cut off from Christ as the vine tree does not mean that we will be lost but that we will lose the genuine enjoyment of Christ
Some have criticized our preaching the gospel by knocking on people's doors by saying that we mostly gain the lower-class people
If we preach the gospel to people by asking them to receive the Lord and giving them a choice, they will not choose Christ but the Devil
If we compel people to believe by directing them to receive the Lord without giving them a choice, many will receive the Lord
The brothers who are 'crazy' in the gospel and compel people to receive the Lord are the ones that get the results
We should not linger in the past, always talking about how wonderful it was when we came into the recovery many years ago
Eating Christ as the tree of life is the first item of the Lord's sevenfold promise to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3
When we rise up early in the morning to have a new revival, that brings us again into the fellowship with the Lord
To the sinners we will preach Christ as the Savior, as the gospel, and to the saved ones we will minister Christ as the life supply
Such a life will save us from many abnormal things, and we will be altogether normal in every way and in every aspect
Christ abiding in them will be the motive for them to get sinners saved, to have home meetings, and to have group meetings
Now that we have seen the life needed for the Lord's present recovery, we need to see the way to practice the Lord's present recovery
We saw in chapter one that the present advance of the Lord's recovery is first to recover the organic building up of the Body of Christ
We have seen this in some places, but it has not become a widespread practice in the churches, so we have to endeavor to go on
The first step of the way to practice the Lord's present recovery is to save sinners by contacting them where they are
Much of the preaching today is that people need to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus; otherwise, they will suffer eternal perdition
To save sinners by contacting them where they are is to bear fruit as an issue of the genuine enjoyment of Christ
He was crucified on the cross years ago, but after He was buried, He resurrected, and in resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit
We have seen how we need to nourish the new believers with their first lesson immediately after they are baptized
Whatever he feels is sinful or wrong, he can confess to the Lord to receive the cleansing of the blood and the Lord's forgiveness
If a team of three saints baptizes ten, they should stop their preaching and divide these ten new ones into three portions to care for them
If your team of three has baptized ten, two saints can each be responsible for three new ones and the other saint for four new ones
Besides your team of three, there should be other teams in the church life, so you can share your new ones with them
If three of your new ones are not promising and will not be remaining fruit, you should go out to baptize some more
If we get revived early in the morning and live an overcoming life during the day, this life will urge us to gain people for the Lord
If we get six baptized within one year, generally, two out of these six will be remaining fruit if we labor on them
We should not expect that everyone in the church will do this gospel work, but we do expect that at least one-third would do it
If thirty-five out of one hundred go out, and they each have two remaining fruit, the church will have a seventy percent increase
The way to preach the gospel by visiting people and knocking on their doors is mainly for the young and middle-aged saints
While Joshua was fighting Amalek, Moses held up the rod of God in his hand on the top of a hill, which typifies prayer
The work of saving sinners for the Lord is a high and great work, so we need the highest techniques to carry it out
It would be good if the church could have a certain kind of training every month for the perfecting of the saints
Sometimes you may need a training to perfect the sisters for one month, perhaps meeting with them three times a week for four weeks
We have been in the old, traditional, and unscriptural way of meeting and serving for years, and we have not seen much result
The newly baptized ones that are remaining fruit can be shared as 'profit' between the door-knocking experts and the home meeting experts
With the small number of us in the Lord's recovery today, it is impossible to have the adequate building up of the Body of Christ
All the saints of all ages should bear the same burden to gain people for the building up of the Body of Christ
We have to go to the mountain-go to the homes, the villages, and the towns-to gain materials for the Lord's house
When parents have a newborn child, they nourish them until they are ready to attend kindergarten at the age of five
In the group meetings we have to edify the new believers to build them up in all the characteristics of the Christian life
The leader of a small group will be manifested according to the Spirit, according to who is bearing the real burden and responsibility
If we do well in practicing a group meeting, our group may need to be divided two or even four times in a year
We need the middleaged and younger saints who are still full of strength to go out to knock on peoples doors for the preaching of the gospel
We need to cherish and nourish the new children in the home meetings and place them in the elementary schools, the group meetings
Our small group meetings include students from the 'elementary' stage all the way to the 'master's degree' stage
With these three items-saving sinners, home meetings, and group meetings-there is a building up, yet we still need something more
We need all the perfected saints to come together on a larger scale to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the church meetings of mutuality
According to our study and experience, it is best to have no more than fifty coming together for the church meeting of mutuality
In the New Testament there is a unique chapter that talks about a definite gift that builds up the Body of Christ
By our prophesying mutually to minister Christ to one another we will be nourished edified joined closely together and knit closely together
In 1 Corinthians 16, Paul directed the saints to separate a certain amount of their income and offer it to God as a gift on the Lord's Day
It was special because it was separated for them to worship God, to remember the Lord, and to serve Him in many other ways
When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, He went to the synagogues on the Sabbath day because that was the day that the Jews gathered together
Most of the nations stop their work on the Lord's Day, so we should follow the Lord's pattern to utilize this day
No other day is as fitting as the Lord's Day for us to worship God, to remember the Lord, and to have a building up meeting
They all function to minister Christ to each other and they receive one another's ministry on Christ as their supply
All prophesy mutually in the church meetings of mutuality to speak building up, encouragement, and consolation
These three items are strong evidences that prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not predicting but speaking forth Christ
Now that we have heard the Lord's speaking concerning His present recovery, we must rise up to bear our responsibility
In other words, we will have a complete exodus from Egypt, and we will be brought fully into the enjoyment of Christ as the good land
The New Testament reveals that each member of the Body of Christ should bear the burden to gain sinners for the Lord
In order to bear remaining fruit, we have to go back to the newly baptized ones to meet with them in their homes
The new ones also have to be grouped together so that they can have a life in which they live together with other Christians
We have to train them and perfect them, instructing them how to go out to preach the gospel by knocking on people's doors
In Christianity people listen to general sermons and teachings for years, and they still do not know how to serve the Lord
We have to promote their preaching of the gospel, their going to have home meetings with others, and their learning to speak for the Lord
At that time, only the one hundred twenty, who had received the outpoured Spirit, were capable of taking care of these new ones
If we do not have a proper budget for our expenses, we will spend our money loosely, and eventually we will be in debt
Of the ones we baptized in the past, many may not have remained because we did not go back to care for them faithfully and consistently
Some may decide to devote every Lord's Day afternoon from three o'clock to six o'clock for knocking on people's doors to preach the gospel
On the first afternoon that we go out to preach the gospel, we may not gain anyone, but we should not be disappointed
Sometimes the Lord will test us to such an extent that we will not gain anyone after going out to preach the gospel five times
In John 21 the disciples fished all night and they caught nothing but at the Lords word to cast their net they caught an abundance of fish
Because he did not gain any interest, he was rebuked by the Lord, and in the coming kingdom age he will suffer a dispensational punishment
When we go to visit sinners with the gospel by knocking on their doors, we are depositing the Lord's investment with the bankers
When we function in the home meetings and group meetings, we are giving food to the Lord's household at the appointed time
If the Lord sees us feeding His household at His return, we will be blessed by receiving His reward in the kingdom age
In the first verse of chapter fourteen, Paul says, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy'
One so-called prophecy among them was that there would be a great earthquake, and the entire city of Los Angeles would go into the ocean
Because of the traditional teaching and practice of Christianity, we thought that to prophesy is merely to foretell, or predict
When we look at the patterns of prophesying in both the Old and New Testaments, we can see that the saints spoke for the Lord
It would be marvelous to see thousands of small group meetings of fifteen to twenty saints in every local church
There would be no practical building up of the Body of Christ organically because we would still be short of prophesying
By August of 1988, the Lord showed us that He needs to recover the truth of 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Ephesians 4:11-16
If we are going to have the practice of 1 Corinthians 14:26, of every saint prophesying, we must practice Ephesians 4:11-16
Suppose an evangelist went to twelve localities and spent one month in each locality to perfect and to train the saints to preach the gospel
Eventually, we all need to be perfected to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, in the larger meetings of the church
He also told us that we had to have something better to replace this traditional way of meeting before we stopped it
We did not endeavor to practice it until we had drifted into a dormant situation, and we were forced to reconsider our way
Many of us have been in the church for years, but we have never been taught nor have we learned how to prophesy
We have to pray, and we have to endeavor to learn how to be strengthened to save sinners by contacting them where they are
We have to dedicate ourselves and devote some of our time to the Lord to take care of home meetings and group meetings
Nearly every phrase and every point of Mary's short prophesying in Luke 1:46-55 is a quotation from the Old Testament
A ready spirit is a spirit that is always one with the Lord, the Spirit, fellowshipping with Him, remaining with Him, and abiding in Him
If we only have the knowledge of the Word and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, we still will not be able to prophesy
We also have the ability to speak because we have the knowledge of the Word for the utterance and the proper expressions
When we speak with these three elements, our speaking is the speaking of the Lord and the speaking forth of the Lord
The patterns of prophesying can be seen with Isaiah and Jeremiah in the Old Testament and with Mary and Zachariah in the New Testament
In that day shall ye say, Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted
In this portion of the Word, Isaiah speaks the Lord, speaks forth the Lord, and speaks the Lord into all of us
They were saturated with the holy Word, they had the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and they had a clear view
Taipei has over one hundred district meetings on the Lord's Day with about fifty saints in each district meeting
In the past we may have charged the saints to speak, to function, but they did not know what to speak or how to function
The saints are ready to speak when they come to the meeting like runners ready to run in a one hundred yard dash
The saints in Taipei have been practicing this, and they have testified that this way to prophesy is rich, high, and living
If we decide to go through the Epistles of Paul, covering about one chapter a week, we can finish them in about two years
The elders may be excited about the fellowship in this book and may be eager to practice it, but we should not practice it too fast
We still need to keep the big meeting on the Lord's Day to have the Lord's table and to have a time to practice the mutual speaking
In this way we can keep the attendants, and gradually they will learn to prepare something to prophesy and speak mutually in the meetings
We must lead the saints to take the 'stairway' so that they can gradually be brought into the Lord's scriptural way
The Lord's move today, the new way, consummates in the building up of the Body of Christ, and the way to build up the Body is by prophesying
To prophesy primarily means to speak something for God and to speak forth God to others, to speak to dispense Christ into others
As a result of this dispensing, we grow, and this growth is the addition of the Triune God to the Body of Christ
In its initial stage, the Body of Christ may be like a small baby, but after much nourishing, the Body will grow with the addition of God
Economy is an anglicization of the Greek word oikonomia, which is composed of the words oikos, meaning house, and nomos, meaning law
The dispensing of the riches of Christ by prophesying can be illustrated by the dispensing of food by a mother
Day by day a mother distributes, or dispenses, food to her little baby until he becomes a strong and husky boy
To prophesy is to distribute, to dispense, the Triune God as the rich food, the nourishing element, into others
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation'
He may be afraid to speak every week; it is hard to prepare a message with many stories, illustrations, quotations, and references
In 1937 Watchman Nee, the senior co-worker among us, called a special meeting in Shanghai for the leading co-workers
We should not merely meet in our halls, but we must go out to visit people for the purpose of preaching the gospel
The other matters that are crucial for the new way are the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the church meetings
Corinthians 14 is a strong encouragement by the apostle for us to learn, to practice, and to desire earnestly to prophesy
We all can play the piano, but we have to be under a tutor and learn how to use our fingers properly, and we have to practice for years
They may say that if learning to prophesy is like learning to play the piano, they will not be able to make it
On Saturday night we can look at our notes and combine them into a single point to be used as the subject for our prophesying
One speaker can only serve one 'dish,' but seventeen speakers can serve a seventeen course feast with many riches
After speaking in the meeting, something will remind us that we have just spoken, and this will restrain us from losing our temper
Many among us have had a turn in our way of speaking, but we still need to pay much attention to the divine element for our speaking
In 1 Corinthians 14 there are thirteen terms used by the Apostle Paul to encourage, charge, and compel us to prophesy
The Bible reveals that we must pursue and desire earnestly to prophesy, but this has been neglected and missed by Christians for centuries
In our prophesying we minister Christ into people, we dispense the very Christ whom we have received, experienced, and enjoyed to others
Prophesying denotes the divine speaking, the divine oracle, not only in the New Testament but also in the Old Testament
As we have pointed out earlier, the foretelling in Old Testament books such as Isaiah and Jeremiah does not occupy many chapters
Verse 12 says, 'So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church'
By his use of these terms, we can see that the Apostle Paul considered prophesying to be the consummation of all his teachings
Paul taught many things, but all his teachings consummate in his word that we can all speak for God, we can all prophesy one by one
What the apostle desired was that each of the believers would be like him, that we would all prophesy in the way he did
If we are going to pursue desire obtain and seek this excelling matter we have to learn and this learning involves two organs of our being
To prophesy requires a very good, sober mind, a mind that not only understands but also remembers what it understands
He forgot what he wanted to speak and got lost in his speaking, so he tries to cover his forgetting by calling on the Lord
We have to exercise our spirit because our spirit is where the divine oracle is, but this divine oracle needs our human cooperation
With regard to gospel preaching for the increase, the situation in Christianity in the United States has also been going down
Recently a number of large denominations came together to study how to cover the entire earth with the gospel of Christ by the year 2000
Because the practice of the clergy-laity system has annulled so many of them, they say that they are short of persons
The gospel has to be spread, preached, and announced, not by inviting people to come to us, but by going to them where they are
Before any new thing is developed, it must be tested many times, and the Full-time Training in Taipei was the 'laboratory' for us
Without a new start, there could be no way for the Lord to complete the building up of His Body as a preparation for His return
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation'
In 1937 Brother Watchman Nee, the senior co-worker among us, saw the light concerning 1 Corinthians 14:26, and he was caught by this vision
He pointed out that the old way of a congregation with one person speaking and the rest listening is according to the customs of the nations
In the Old Testament, God charged His people not to worship according to the customs of the nations after they came into the good land
The traditional practice of meeting is not scriptural but rather is something of the Gentiles, and we have to give it up
Brother Nee proposed that instead of having a meeting on the Lord's Day morning, the saints should go out to preach the gospel
If we stopped the Lord's Day morning meeting in order to go out to preach the gospel, many would simply become idle
Certain saints had been under my ministry for over thirty-five years, but they still could not speak even a short word to save sinners
In certain denominations many lay members not only do not know how to speak for the Lord, but they also do not even know how to pray
There were three thousand meeting, but it was hard for the elders to prepare twenty-one speakers to speak every Lord's Day
In order to have a meeting full of mutual prophesying according to 1 Corinthians 14:26, we must practice Ephesians 4:11-16
The way is the perfecting of the saints by the four kinds of giftsthe apostles the prophets the evangelists and the shepherds and teachers
In the past we did not see this light so clearly, and we did not practice this perfecting work to a proper extent
On the Lord's Day, one speaker would give a message, but at most that message only edified the saints; it did not perfect them
Our practice in the past has also lacked the development of the organic functions of the saints for the building up of the Body of Christ
The organic Body of Christ cannot be built up without helping the organic members of the organic Body to function
As part of the development of their function, the saints can be instructed how to go to the meeting with something in their hands
In the Full-time Training in Taipei, we have been teaching the co-workers and full-timers how to prophesy for three minutes
On Saturday night they add together all the points which they have enjoyed the past six mornings and compose a prophecy
Some saints may not have liked to go to the meeting because they felt they had nothing to speak and did not know how to speak
The saints in Taipei have at most ninety minutes for this kind of sharing, and each person takes about three minutes
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Today the Lord demands that we have the recovery of the meeting in mutuality as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 1426 by practicing Ephesians 41116
