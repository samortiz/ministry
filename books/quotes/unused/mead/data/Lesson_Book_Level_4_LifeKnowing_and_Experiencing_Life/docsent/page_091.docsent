   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. BUILDING UP THE BODY THROUGH PROPHESYING IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The final step is to prophesy and help your new ones to prophesy in the church meeting so that you may build up the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Corinthians 14:4b says, "He who prophesies builds up the church.''</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prophesying in 1 Corinthians 14 is not predicting but speaking for the Lord, speaking forth the Lord, and speaking the Lord into others, ministering dispensing the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a precious and valuable thing it is to minister, to dispense Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to learn to speak Christ, dispensing Him into others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Corinthians reveals that we need to enjoy Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we enjoy will have an issue.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The enjoyment of Christ firstly issues in the growth in life to produce materials for the building up of the church 3:6, 9-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The enjoyment of Christ also issues in the development of gifts for functioning to build up the Body of Christ, prophesying being the excelling gift 1 Cor 14:1, 12, 39a .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To build up anything you need firstly the materials and secondly the skill, the functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, the enjoyment of Christ issues not only in the growth in life but also in the development of gifts for functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Dispensing Christ by speaking Him, prophesying, is the top development of the gifts as an issue of enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whenever we call on the Lord and pray-read the word, we must have some enjoyment of Christ and some experiences of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should write down these revelations and experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On Saturday, we should use these notes to compose a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also should help our new ones to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the Lord's day, when the whole church comes together, you and your new ones will have a revelation or a testimony 1 Cor 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then you and your new ones should prophesy or testify according to what you have composed concerning the Lord Psa 45:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When you speak for the Lord this way you will build up the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You will tear down the degraded system of clergy-laity, which the Lord hates Rev 2:6 , to build up the church directly Eph 4:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way, the prophecy foretelling of the Lord, "I will build My church'' Matt 16:18 , will be partially fulfilled by you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you and all the saints in the churches will rise up to experience life, to grow in life, to deal with all the hindrances by repenting and confessing, to maintain a strong spirit by calling and praying, to be enriched with the Word of God by pray-reading, reading, studying, and memorizing, to speak Christ every day in every place to every person, to live a normal Christian daily life, and to have a normal church life, then the Body of Christ will be built, the Lord will return, you will enter into the millennial kingdom as a reward, and finally, you will be the New Jerusalem for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the final issue of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We all have to praise the Lord that He is the eternal, divine, and indestructible life in us to produce such wonderful results.</S>
