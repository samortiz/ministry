   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Example Ten</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is right for brothers to forgive brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But sometimes we find a brother forgiving someone who has offended him in a very loud, forceful, and deliberate way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has forgiven generously, but we inwardly feel that something is not right; it seems that the forgiveness is too deliberate; it does not feel like the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is because he has not touched reality.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may meet another brother who was hurt by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is sad and not rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet he believes that God can never be wrong and that he ought to forgive from his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He does not proclaim loudly with his mouth that he is forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not show others that he is forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He does not seem as unconcerned as the first one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet in the end, he forgives his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One senses that this brother is not performing; he is forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has touched the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Example Eleven</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Humility should be something that leaves a good impression in the mind of others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the humility of some Christians makes others feel that they are striving to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They say with their mouth that they can do nothing, yet one has the feeling that this is "self-chosen lowliness" and "self-imposed lowliness" Col 2:18, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It gives one the feeling that what is being expressed is not humility itself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If it is outright pride, one can still call it by its name.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But it is hard to pinpoint what this kind of humility really is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One cannot say that it is pride, but neither can one say that it is humility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Outwardly, it looks like humility, but actually it is far from the reality of it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Another brother may not be striving as hard to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But a little remark by him and a spontaneous expression from him exposes others' pride immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others feel ashamed of their pride; they feel that if anyone is qualified to be proud, this brother should be the one because he has something to be proud of.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet this brother considers others better than himself, and he seeks their help in a very unpretentious way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This brother has touched the reality of humility.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Example Twelve</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let us consider the example of love again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 13 gives us a clear picture of love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"And if I dole out all my possessions to feed others, and if I deliver up my body that I may boast " v. 3 . Humanly speaking, it is hard to find this kind of love in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can say that there is no greater love than this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet Paul continued by saying, " but do not have love, I profit nothing" v. 3 . This means that it is possible to be without love even when one doles out all his possessions to feed others and delivers up his body that he may boast.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, unless he is touching the reality in the Spirit, he merely has outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is possible for a brother to dole out all of his possessions to feed others and deliver up his body yet, at the same time, be without love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if a brother "gives to one of these little ones only a cup of cold water to drink he shall by no means lose his reward" Matt 10:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The basic question is not how much or how little one does, but whether or not he has touched reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The only thing that is real is touching reality through the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must see that in God's eyes we cannot do more than what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some people's love is great, but it makes others doubt whether the love is real or false.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some Christians have such a great "love" that they seem to be void of any human feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It makes others put a question mark on their love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In reading 2 Corinthians, we realize that Paul was misunderstood, slandered, and afflicted with pain and hardship; however, he overcame these things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His victory was the victory of a man, not the victory of an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He genuinely overcame, and he was a genuine man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He was a genuine man, and his victory was a genuine victory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through the Spirit of God, he touched something real.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we read his writings, we cannot help but bow our head and say that here is a man who is not too distant from us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can almost touch such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We feel that he was not among the ranks of Michael or Gabriel; he was not a person living among the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We feel that he was one we can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is because he had the spiritual reality, and when we touch such a man, we touch life.</S>
