   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOUR RINGS OF BRONZE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>UPON THE FOUR ENDS OF THE GRATING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have pointed out that at the four ends of the grating, the network, there were four bronze rings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In typology these rings refer to the eternal Spirit spoken of in Hebrews 9:14: How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ s blood is effective because He offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The eternal Spirit, typified by the rings on the network, is the source of the efficacy of Christ s cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The eternal Spirit is the power, the strength, of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Apart from the eternal Spirit, the redemption of Christ could not be effective; it could not be powerful and full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again I say, the eternal Spirit is the power, the strength, the efficacy, of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the four bronze rings had been taken away from the grating, the grating would have fallen down.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was held to the altar by the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is full of spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may talk about the cross, about the death of Christ on the cross, and about the fact that we have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But without the Spirit, all this talk would be vain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apart from the eternal Spirit, the death of Christ is not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is very crucial that we realize that the efficacy and power of Christ s redemption depend upon the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the altar did not have the four rings, the grating could not stay in place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then the altar would not have any content.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, there would be no way for the altar to move.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus the four rings are very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of the four rings, the grating could be held in place at half the height of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of the four rings, there was a way for the altar to be carried.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But although the rings were so important to the altar, they were not the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ Himself is the sacrifice, but the saving and moving power of this sacrifice is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without the rings, the grating would lose its effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There would be no power in the cross to save, and there would be no strength for the move of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The death of Christ is far beyond our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ s death is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not think that we can comprehend it in full, for we have no way to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we cannot fully understand the mystery of Christ s death on the cross, we do know that redemption was accomplished through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you know why the preaching of Christ s death today is often powerless?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is because in this preaching there is a lack of the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ offered Himself as the sin offering through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, because of the Spirit, what He accomplished on the cross is powerful and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But if we preach the cross of Christ without the Spirit, we shall not have the power to move others, to touch their heart and their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This must be the work of the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Exodus 27 the ledge is not spoken of in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the four rings are clearly described.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Nevertheless, it is somewhat mysterious how these rings could be connected to the grating inside the altar and yet themselves be outside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This signifies that although the Spirit is truly manifest, it is also mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Spirit is manifested outwardly, but it is connected to something inside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The rings were outside the altar, yet they were connected to the grating inside the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The death of Christ cannot be fully understood by us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, the Spirit is manifest; on the other hand, it is mysterious, for the Spirit is connected to Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The four rings signifying the eternal Spirit are connected to the grating, which signifies the inner content of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that the Holy Spirit is connected to the inner content of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have the redemption of Christ in reality, then we also have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Spirit is connected to this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In other words, if we have the four rings, we have the grating.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we have the eternal Spirit, we also have the full redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am very thankful for the picture in Exodus 27.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Through this picture we can see that the eternal Spirit is linked to the full redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the grating?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The grating is the inner content of Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What are the four rings?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The four rings are the type of the eternal Spirit, who makes Christ s redemption effective and who is the power for the move of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The word of the cross is powerful because it is joined to the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we preach the cross with the redemption of Christ, this preaching must be connected to the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then in our experience we shall have a grating with four rings, the redemption of Christ connected to the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For more than thirty-eight years, the altar traveled with the children of Israel through the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While the altar was being carried, the fire inside it was still burning.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The fire on the altar never ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That fire did not come as a result of human initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Bible tells us that it came from the Lord Lev 9:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, it was a heavenly fire that burned continually as the altar was carried in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While the altar was moving, the fire was burning.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This indicates that while the redemption of Christ on the cross is being preached, the fire burns.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Wherever the altar goes, there the fire burns.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The move of the altar does not depend on the fire; it depends on the four rings.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This means that the move of the altar is by the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The burning, however, is by the fire, not by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to see that two things take place simultaneously: the burning of the fire and the moving of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The four rings on the altar are related both to the burning and to the moving.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have seen that if it were not for the rings, the grating could not be held in place at half the height of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If there is to be a burning on the altar, the four rings are necessary to hold the grating in place.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Furthermore, in order for the altar to move, the four rings are also necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Both the burning and the moving are dependent on the four rings.</S>
