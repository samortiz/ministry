<h2 class="head1">WHAT PAUL KNEW</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Hope</h2>
<p>I would like to point out that not only does the Lord Jesus&rsquo; own word testify to this, but Paul said the same thing. He knew the Lord, and he showed us one very interesting thing. He said to Timothy, &ldquo;Christ Jesus our hope&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:1). I like this word. Do you like it? He did not say that our hope is in Christ Jesus. Rather, he said Christ Jesus is our hope. We do not put our hope in Him, and we do not draw hope from Him. Rather, Christ Jesus is our hope.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Life</h2>
<p>Again he said to the Colossians, &ldquo;When Christ our life is manifested...&rdquo; (Col. 3:4). He did not say, &ldquo;When Christ is manifested.&rdquo; Rather, he said, &ldquo;When Christ our life is manifested.&rdquo; He said that Christ is our life. A Christian does not have many matters; a Christian only has Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Wisdom:<br />
Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption</h2>
<p>This is not all. In these messages, the one verse that we emphasize more than any other verse is 1 Corinthians 1:30. What does it say? It says, &ldquo;But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; God has not given us righteousness; He has given us Christ. Christ is our righteousness. God has not given us sanctification; He has given us Christ. Christ is our sanctification. God has not given us redemption; He has given us Christ. Christ is our redemption. God has not given us wisdom; He has given us Christ. Christ is our wisdom. This is why we say that the Christ of God is the things of God. God&rsquo;s Christ is God&rsquo;s matters and things. Apart from Christ, God does not have any matter or thing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Righteousness</h2>
<p>If God were to say to us, &ldquo;I have made the Lord Jesus the Lord of righteousness; He is the One who justifies you,&rdquo; what would you say? You would say &ldquo;Yes, He has justified us.&rdquo; But God has not asked the Lord Jesus to be the Justifier; He has asked the Lord Jesus to be our righteousness. Is this good? This is excellent. He is not the Justifier, but our righteousness. He is our righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Sanctification</h2>
<p>Paul did not say that the Lord Jesus has become &ldquo;the One that sanctifies.&rdquo; Rather, he said that Christ is sanctification. The Lord Jesus is not sanctifying us; He Himself is becoming our sanctification. God has made the Lord Jesus our sanctification. Our sanctification is Christ. Our sanctification is not a thing; it is not an act or a behavior. Our sanctification is a person&mdash;Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ Being Our Redemption</h2>
<p>Again Paul did not say that the Lord is our Redeemer. He said that the Lord is our redemption. Is this not strange? First Corinthians 1:30 does not say that God has appointed the Lord Jesus to be a Redeemer. Rather, it says that the Lord Jesus is redemption.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that our Redeemer is Christ, and our redemption is also Christ. The One who sanctifies is Christ, and our sanctification is also Christ. The One who justifies is Christ, and our righteousness is also Christ. The One who gives wisdom is Christ, and that wisdom is also Christ!</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHAT DAVID KNEW</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Our Salvation</h2>
<p>If I stand here and say to you, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus is our Savior,&rdquo; you will respond, &ldquo;That is right. The Lord Jesus is our Savior.&rdquo; But Psalm 27:1 tells us that the Lord is our salvation. It shows us that the Lord is our salvation and not our Savior. It is a fact that the Lord is our Savior. But God showed David that the Lord is our salvation. The Lord is our Savior, but He is also our salvation; He is that very thing. The Lord Jesus is the things of God. He is God&rsquo;s matters and God&rsquo;s things. The Lord Jesus Himself is the very thing that God has given us.</p>
<p>I have no intention of remaining too long on the exposition of the Bible. I am merely laying a foundation. If you spend some time to consider God&rsquo;s Word, you will see that Christ is God&rsquo;s things. God has not only given Him to be our Savior and our Redeemer. He has not only given Him to be the Lord of sanctification and the Lord of righteousness. He has given us Christ to be our things. Righteousness is a thing, sanctification is a thing, and justification is a thing, or a matter. But Christ is these matters or things.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THERE BEING ONLY ONE PERSON<br />
IN THE CHRISTIANITY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>You may ask, &ldquo;Brother, why do you have to spend so much time on all this?&rdquo; I must tell you that this is the very difference between a Christianity of life and a Christianity of behavior. There is a vast difference between these two kinds of ways. The gap between these two ways is very great. One is spiritual, and the other is not. One is of God, and the other is of man&rsquo;s mind. These are two entirely different things. If you study God&rsquo;s Word, you will find that there is only one person in His Word; there are not many things. There is only the person; there are not matters and things. There is only one person&mdash;the Lord Jesus. Other than this person, one cannot find any other matter or thing.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with God&rsquo;s children today is that the Christianity they know is a fragmented Christianity. One person receives a little grace. Another person receives a little gift. A third person picks up tongue-speaking, while a fourth person experiences some changes in his behavior. Some have love, some have endurance, and some have humility. You may consider this as Christianity. Indeed, this is the Christianity that man speaks of today. But actually, this is not Christianity. Christianity is just Christ. Christianity is not a gift; it is not Christ giving you something. Christianity is just Christ Himself. Can you tell the difference between the two? These are absolutely two different ways; they are two entirely different ways. Christianity is not Christ giving you something. Christianity is Christ giving Himself to you. The problem is that in today&lsquo;s Christianity, man thinks only in terms of Christ&rsquo;s gifts. When he was a sinner, Christ gave him grace and mercy. Now that he has become a Christian, Christ gives him endurance and Christ gives him humility and meekness. It seems as if Christ is giving him many things.</p>
