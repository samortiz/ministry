   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>No Oneness of the Body without the Authority of the Head</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today God is taking the way of the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to have the oneness of the Body, there must first be the life of the Head and then the authority of the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the life of the Head, there is no Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, without the authority of the Head, there is no oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must allow the life of the Head to rule so that the Body can become one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God requires that we submit not only to Him, but also to all His deputy authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the members have to learn to submit to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Head and the Body are also one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's will can be accomplished only when the authority of the Head prevails.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God wants the church be the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A Few Points on the Lesson of Submission to Authority</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A servant of God will eventually encounter authority in the universe, in his community, in his home, or in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a man has never met God's authority, how can he submit to God?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not a matter of doctrine or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If it is, it will still be abstract to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some think that submission to authority is a very difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But it is not difficult when one meets God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unless God's mercy is upon us, no one can submit to God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, there should be a few points for us to learn:</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 There must be a spirit of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2 There must be the training in submission.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people are like savages; they cannot come under any submission.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have appointed a housekeeper for every household with the hope that we would all learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Translator's Note: This refers to the dormitories of the training in which these messages were delivered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Everyone should receive training by standing in the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One who has learned the lesson or who has been trained will not feel restricted no matter where he is placed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He will spontaneously live out submission without any difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3 One must learn to be a deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A worker of God must not only learn submission to authority; he must also learn to be God's deputy authority in the church and in the home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If God entrusts him with many things, and if he has learned to submit under God's authority, he will not feel boastful about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, some who have learned to submit to others find that they do not know how to be the authority when they are brought by God to a place to work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, not only do we have to learn to submit to authority, but we also have to learn to be the authority and to stand in the proper position.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the one hand, the church suffers because many do not submit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the other hand, the church suffers because many do not know how to be the authority by standing in the proper position.</S>
