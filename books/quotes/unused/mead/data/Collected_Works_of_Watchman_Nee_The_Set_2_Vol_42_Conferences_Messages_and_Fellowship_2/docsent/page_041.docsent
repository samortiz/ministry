   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SALVATION IN CHRIST The Principle Being the Same in Christ as in Adam</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's salvation works the same way as the free gift that Adam gave to us in making us sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's salvation in Christ is the same in principle as our being sinners in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we are in Adam, there is no need for us to do anything to inherit his sinful nature and power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are in Christ, there is no need for us to make up our mind, do anything, or come up with anything to receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as we are in Christ, God's salvation comes to us unconditionally, freely, and unreservedly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as we are in Christ, everything of Christ becomes ours.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no need for us to exert any strength or to think or make up our mind to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The situation is exactly the same as when we were in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I sin because the life of Adam is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the same way, I am good, righteous, and holy because I am in Christ and the life of Christ is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is no need for me to exert any strength of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only one condition is crucial we must be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The gospel annuls our previous relationship in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our relationship with Christ today is just the same as our relationship with Adam previously.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Friends, what grace our God has bestowed upon us!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I can say with joy and happiness that we can enjoy everything there is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Christ we can partake of all that Christ can do and all that He has.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of participation does not require any effort of our own; it comes naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as we are in Christ, it is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is just like sinning without any effort when we were in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Christ there is no place for any effort of our own; we can be humble, patient, meek, holy, and transcendent over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as we are in Christ, we can do all these things and we can have all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Becoming a New Creation in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us see what the Bible says about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please read 2 Corinthians 5:17.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Does it say, "If anyone does good, he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new"?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It does not say that only those who make up their mind and strive to do good are transferred from the old creation to the new.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, it says, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no other condition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not a matter of what we are, how we make up our minds, or how hard we strive to change ourselves into a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It says that as long as we are in Christ, we are a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, we all constantly think about how we can become a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We try to improve ourselves, changing a little today and a little tomorrow, gradually working ourselves into a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though we are not humble in our heart, we think that we can start at least by being humble with our words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We try to speak to others in a humble way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Or we may try to practice holiness by first being holy with our words and then holy with our thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We think that although we are evil today, we can change for the better and gradually make ourselves holy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We hope that this will one day change us into a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is difficult for us to say how long we will need for such a change, but we think that it may take ten or twenty years, or perhaps even a lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But please read the Word of God: "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being a new creation has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As long as we are in Christ, we are a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>During my gospel meetings in Kaifeng, the younger brother of a magistrate came to me and said, "I admit that I have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But no matter what you say, I still believe in Buddhism and in self-enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have studied Buddhism for a few years, not in the superstitious ways, but by a philosophical approach and by seeking after peace of mind and contentment of life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Yet the more I study and the harder I try, the less peace of mind I have; it seems that turmoil is always within me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have been practicing this for a few years, but have not made much progress, but I intend to spend another thirty years to continue my pursuit, and I hope that I will succeed eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to what you have said, a man can become a new man within a day.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once he is in Christ, he becomes a new man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can this be?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have studied many religious books and found that the Christian way is the fastest way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But you are very bold.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Your way is even faster than the Christian way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>How can this be?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I did not give him too much of an explanation, I only told him to go home and try it out.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the next meeting, he came and said, "Your method is fast.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The next time you have a baptism, please tell me about it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I want to be baptized."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everything that is in Christ happens fast; there is no need to improve or adjust ourselves slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All the virtues are in Christ; they do not become ours by self-improvement, nor are they manufactured.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As long as we are in Christ, we have all the virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Does a lamp need to pray for a few hours, make resolutions, or strive before it can shine?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No. All it needs is to be connected to electricity and it will shine.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no light in the lamp itself; all it does is allow light to shine through it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The same is true with a Christian; he cannot accomplish anything through self-enlightenment, struggling, or conjectures.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>All he has to do is to touch Christ the "electrical power source."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Regeneration, sanctification, and power are all in Christ; they have nothing to do with changing ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The overcoming life, holiness, humility, etc., are all Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we are in Christ, we have all of these.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have to say, "Thank Christ that it is not I. All the glory goes to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everything is done by Christ; it is not done by me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I receive everything in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The only condition is being in Christ; there is no other condition.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As long as we are in Christ, we are a new creation, and the old creation has passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The question is: Are you in Adam or are you in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Sinning or overcoming, perishing or having eternal life have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It all depends on which man we are in. This is God's way of salvation; it is the way described in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God saves us by putting us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In dealing with Christ, He has dealt with everything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Do you still remember the illustration of the chalk box and the chalk?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Wherever the chalk box is, there is the chalk.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The destiny of the chalk box is the destiny of the chalk.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The pieces of chalk do not have to ask what will happen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All they have to ask is what will happen to the chalk box.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is our relationship with Christ; we do not have to ask about ourselves; we only need to ask about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As long as we are in Christ, whatever Christ is becomes ours.</S>
