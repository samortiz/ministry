<h1 class="title">Announcing the All-inclusive Christ,<br />
Jehovah the Savior, as the Glad Tidings</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 40:1-26</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The all-inclusive Christ is Jehovah the Savior, the glad tidings&mdash;Isa. 40:5, 9; 43:3, 11; 45:21; 49:26; 60:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Jehovah</em> means &ldquo;He who was, who is, and who will be&rdquo;&mdash;Exo. 3:14:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s name is I Am; His name is simply the verb <em>to be:</em>
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>I Am</em> denotes the One who is self-existing, the One whose being depends on nothing apart from Himself.</li>
			<li>The I Am is also the ever-existing One; that is, He exists eternally, having neither beginning nor ending.</li>
			<li>Apart from God, all else is nothing; He is the only One who is, the only One who has the reality of being&mdash;Isa. 40:12-18.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>God requires us to believe that He is&mdash;Heb. 11:6.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Jesus is Jehovah&mdash;Exo. 3:14; John 18:4-6:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord Jesus is I Am&mdash;the eternal, self-existing, ever-existing God, the One who is everything to us&mdash;8:24, 28, 58.</li>
		<li>The name <em>Jesus</em> means &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 1:21.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The coming of the all-inclusive Christ as the glad tidings is to be announced as Jehovah our God (Isa. 40:3), as Jehovah of glory (v. 5), as the Lord Jehovah coming with might to rule (vv. 9-10), and as a Shepherd feeding His flock (v. 11).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The word of comfort spoken to the heart of Jerusalem is actually the announcing of the gospel; the fact that this word is spoken to the heart means that it is concerned not with the outer man but with the inner man&mdash;vv. 1-2.</li>
<li>Christ as Jehovah the Savior was ushered in by the voice of one (John the Baptist) crying in the wilderness&mdash;vv. 3-4; Matt. 3:1-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To make clear, or to prepare, the way of Jehovah is to prepare our heart; every part and avenue of our heart needs to be straightened by the Lord through repentance so that the Lord may enter into us to be our life and take possession of us&mdash;Isa. 40:3; Prov. 4:20-23; Matt. 5:8; 15:7-8; Luke 1:17; Eph. 3:16-17.</li>
	<li>To make clear the way of Jehovah is to make clear the way of Jesus, who is the New Testament Jehovah; the way of Jesus is a highway for our God, indicating that Jesus is our God&mdash;Isa. 40:3; Matt. 1:21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the glory of Jehovah is the revealing of Jehovah&mdash;Isa. 40:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The glory of Jehovah is the center of the gospel for the new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 4:4-6; Heb. 1:3; Luke 1:78:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Glory is the expression of God&mdash;John 1:1, 14.</li>
		<li>Christ is the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory, and this effulgence is like the shining of the sun&mdash;Heb. 1:3; Luke 1:78-79.</li>
		<li>When Christ appeared, the glory of Jehovah was revealed to be seen by the God-seekers and Christ-believers&mdash;Matt. 17:1-2, 5; Luke 2:25-32; 9:32; John 1:14; 2 Pet. 1:16-18.</li>
		<li>To those on whom Christ has shined, Christ is the glory of God and the hope of glory within them&mdash;Col. 1:27; 2 Cor. 3:15-16, 18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The gospel is the gospel of the glory of Christ, which illuminates, radiates, and shines into the heart of man&mdash;4:4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The illumination, the enlightenment, that makes the glory of Christ&rsquo;s gospel known to us issues from the shining of God in our hearts&mdash;v. 6.</li>
		<li>God&rsquo;s shining in our hearts brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything&mdash;v. 7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jehovah is revealed through His speaking&mdash;John 1:1, 14, 29, 32, 36, 42, 51; 3:34; 7:16-17; 14:24:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word of God is actually Christ Himself, the embodiment of God, as the gospel of God&mdash;Isa. 40:8; Col. 2:9; Rom. 1:1, 3-4, 16; 10:6-8.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus was sent by the Father for the purpose of speaking the word of God for God&rsquo;s expression; in His word, His speaking, God is revealed and presented to us&mdash;John 1:1, 14, 18; 3:34; 5:36-37; 7:17; 14:10.</li>
	<li>The entire fallen human race is like withering grass, and its glory like the falling flower of grass; the believers in Christ were once like that, but the living and abiding word of the Lord has changed their nature, making them living and abiding forever&mdash;Isa. 40:6-8; 1 Pet. 1:23-25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Those who receive Christ, the glory of God, as the living and abiding word of God, are regenerated and have eternal life to live forever&mdash;John 1:12-13; 3:15.</li>
		<li>This living word has brought the eternal life into us to regenerate us, and we have received the eternal life for our daily enjoyment&mdash;1 Pet. 1:23-25.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s word will stand forever to enliven men that they may partake of His eternal life for their enjoyment&mdash;Isa. 40:6-8; 1 Pet. 1:23-25; Rev. 2:7.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In Isaiah 40:9-26 we have the revelation of the Lord Jehovah&mdash;the manifestation of the Lord Jesus Christ, the incomparable God:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Behold your God!&rdquo;&mdash;v. 9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This is the revealing of the Lord Jehovah, the appearing of the very God as the Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior, in His becoming a man through incarnation&mdash;Matt. 1:18-23; Luke 1:35; John 1:1, 14.</li>
		<li>Jesus, who is Jehovah, is our God; the revealing of Jehovah is the appearing of Jesus&mdash;vv. 1, 14; 8:24, 28, 58; Matt. 1:21.</li>
		<li>Christ is the complete God manifested in the flesh&mdash;1 Tim. 3:16:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Word, who is God, became flesh&mdash;John 1:1, 14.</li>
			<li>In incarnation Christ is the entire God manifested in the flesh&mdash;1 Tim. 3:16.</li>
			<li>In Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily&mdash;Col. 2:9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Such a brief declaration&mdash;Behold your God!&mdash;is the glad tidings&mdash;Isa. 40:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Lord Jehovah as Jesus Christ is the Ruler who comes as a mighty One to rule over us, and He is the Judge to either reward or punish us&mdash;v. 10; Matt. 2:6; 25:14-30; 2 Cor. 5:10.</li>
	<li>As the mighty One, the ruling and judging One, Christ comes to be a Shepherd; He cares for His flock by ruling and correcting His sheep and by feeding His flock, gathering the lambs in His arm, carrying them in His bosom, and leading those who are nursing the young&mdash;Isa. 40:11; Matt. 2:6; 9:36; John 10:2-4, 11, 14.</li>
	<li>Christ is the Holy One, the eternal God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, sitting above the circle of the earth&mdash;Isa. 40:22, 25-26, 28a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the Holy One, Jesus is unlimited, unsearchable, incomparable, and high; there is no comparison between Him and anyone or anything else&mdash;vv. 12-18, 28b, 22a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>All peoples are like a drop of water from a bucket, like specks of dust on the scales, and are nothing, even less than nothing, just vanity, emptiness&mdash;Isa. 40:15, 17; Eccl. 1:2; cf. S. S. 1:1.</li>
			<li>The proper preaching of the all-inclusive Christ as the glad tidings, the gospel, causes people to realize that they are nothing and that Christ is everything&mdash;Isa. 40:15, 17.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The more we realize that apart from Christ we are nothing, emptiness, and vanity, the more we will appreciate Christ, treasure Christ, and seek to be filled, saturated, and permeated with Christ&mdash;Phil. 3:7-8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The prophet&rsquo;s speaking in Isaiah 40&mdash;his announcing of the all-inclusive Christ, Jehovah the Savior, as the glad tidings&mdash;is an excellent example of preaching the gospel; all human beings need the incomparable God (vv. 18-26), the coming Christ (v. 3), the glory of Jehovah as the center of the gospel for the new creation (v. 5), the living and abiding word of God for regeneration to have eternal life (vv. 6-8), and the manifestation of the Lord Jehovah, the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ (vv. 9-12).</li>
</ol><h1 class="msg">Message Two</h1>
<h1 class="title">Living in the Reality of the New Creation</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 40:3-5, 28-31</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah, corresponding to the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, focus mainly on the old creation, whereas the last twenty-seven chapters, corresponding to the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, center on the new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah 40 reveals the announcing of the gospel (corresponding to the four Gospels&mdash;Isa. 40:1-5), salvation through regeneration (corresponding to the Acts&mdash;Isa. 40:6-8), and transformation (corresponding to the Epistles&mdash;Isa. 40:28-31); this is the revelation of God becoming a man through incarnation so that man might become God (in life and in nature but not in the Godhead) through regeneration and transformation as the content of God&rsquo;s eternal economy.</li>
	<li>Both Isaiah 40 and the New Testament begin with the coming of John the Baptist, who ushered in the expected Christ for the initiation of the new creation&mdash;vv. 3-5; Mark 1:1-11.</li>
	<li>The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, constituted of the believers, who are born of God, does (John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet. 1:4); hence, the believers are a new creation (Gal. 6:15), not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life (Rom. 6:4; 7:6).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>John the Baptist is typified by Elijah (Luke 1:17), who is a type of the Old Testament age with the Old Testament economy, and the Lord Jesus is typified by Elisha, who is a type of the New Testament age with the New Testament economy (4:27); according to 2 Kings 2:1-15, the age was changed to the new creation by passing through four places&mdash;Gilgal, Bethel, Jericho, and the river Jordan:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Gilgal was a place where God&rsquo;s people were circumcised to deal with their flesh&mdash;Josh. 5:2-9; Col. 2:11; John 3:6; Gal. 5:16-17, 24-25.</li>
	<li>Bethel is the place to give up the world and turn to God absolutely, taking God as everything&mdash;Gen. 12:8; 13:3-4.</li>
	<li>Jericho, the first city that Joshua and the people of Israel had to defeat when they entered into the good land, signifies God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan&mdash;Josh. 6:1-27; Eph. 6:12; Rom. 16:20.</li>
	<li>The river Jordan, where the New Testament baptism began, signifies death&mdash;Matt. 3:5-6, 15-17:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To cross the river Jordan, Elijah struck the water with his mantle, which typifies the outpoured Spirit, the Spirit of power&mdash;2 Kings 2:8; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:8.</li>
		<li>The Spirit of power dealt with the river of death so that the way was open for Elijah and Elisha to cross over.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>All this signifies that in order for us to be raptured like Elijah or receive the power of the Spirit like Elisha, and in order for the age to be changed from the Old Testament to the New Testament in our experience, we must deal with our flesh by the Spirit of life (Gal. 5:16-17, 24), give up the world and turn to God by the love of the Father (1 John 2:15-17), defeat Satan through the word of the Son (Rev. 12:11; Matt. 4:4), and pass through death to die to the self by the power of resurrection for the Body of Christ (Rom. 6:3-4; Gal. 2:20; Phil. 3:10; Matt. 16:24).</li>
	<li>Furthermore, we must &ldquo;tear our clothes into two pieces&rdquo; (2 Kings 2:12), indicating that we no longer treasure what we are or what we can do (cf. Matt. 16:24); through all these steps we enter into a new age of the new creation, the age of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in grace, which is God doing everything for us by giving Himself to us as our enjoyment (John 1:1, 14-17).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>John was born a priest, but instead of serving with Zachariah in the temple, he stayed in a wild place, wore wild clothing, ate wild food, and did a wild work; he denied the entire Old Testament priesthood, but his work was the beginning of the priesthood in the New Testament for the new creation&mdash;Mark 1:1-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first New Testament priest of the gospel of God was John the Baptist, the forerunner of the Lord Jesus&mdash;cf. Rom. 15:16.</li>
	<li>He preached the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins as the gospel of Jesus Christ; his ministry was &ldquo;the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God&rdquo;&mdash;Mark 1:1.</li>
	<li>He did not offer bulls and goats as sacrifices (Heb. 10:1-4), but he offered sinners saved through his preaching as sacrifices (Mark 1:5).</li>
	<li>The New Testament priesthood offers sinners saved into Christ as the main sacrifices; they are offered to God in Christ, with Christ, and one with Christ as the very enlargement of Christ to be a part of the new creation&mdash;1 Pet. 2:5; Rom. 15:16; 12:1; Col. 1:28-29.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Isaiah 40:28-31 reveals a regenerated and transformed person who is one with the eternal God and absolutely in the new creation&mdash;&ldquo;Do you not know, / Or have you not heard, / That the eternal God, Jehovah, / The Creator of the ends of the earth, / Does not faint and does not become weary? / There is no searching out of His understanding. / He gives power to the faint, / And to those who have no vigor He multiplies strength. / Although youths will faint and become weary, / And young men will collapse exhausted; / Yet those who wait on Jehovah will renew their strength; / They will mount up with wings like eagles; / They will run and will not faint; / They will walk and will not become weary&rdquo;:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah 40 presents a comparison between Hezekiah, a godly man who was still in the old creation (chs. 36&mdash;39), and a regenerated and transformed person in the new creation; the apostle Paul is the best representative of the kind of person described in Isaiah 40.</li>
	<li>The Lord gives power to the faint, and to those who have no vigor He multiplies strength&mdash;v. 29; Eph. 6:10; Phil. 4:12-13; 2 Tim. 2:1-2; 4:7.</li>
	<li>To wait on the eternal God means that we terminate ourselves, that is, that we stop ourselves with our living, our doing, and our activity, and receive God in Christ as our life, our person, and our replacement&mdash;Isa. 8:17; Gal. 2:20; Heb. 12:2; Col. 4:2.</li>
	<li>Such a waiting one will be renewed and strengthened to such an extent that he will mount up with wings like eagles; as a transformed person, he will not only walk and run but also soar in the heavens, far above every earthly frustration.</li>
	<li>An eagle signifies the powerful, transcendent God, and its wings signify the resurrection power of Christ (the grace, strength, and power of God applied to us)&mdash;Exo. 19:4; 1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 1:12; 4:7; 12:9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The eagle&rsquo;s wings are the means by which the four living creatures are coordinated and move as one (Ezek. 1:11); this signifies that our coordination is not in ourselves but in God and by the divine power, the divine strength, and the divine grace.</li>
		<li>The wings of an eagle are not only for moving but also for protection; whatever we do and whatever we are must be by the grace of the Lord and the power of the Lord; at the same time, we are under the overshadowing, the covering, of the Lord&rsquo;s grace and the Lord&rsquo;s power&mdash;Psa. 17:8; 57:1; 63:7; 91:4; 2 Cor. 12:9b.</li>
		<li>The using of two wings to cover the living creatures indicates that in the coordination we should not display ourselves but should hide ourselves under the Lord&rsquo;s grace&mdash;3:5-6; 12:9; Phil. 3:3.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>May we all be like Paul, who was absolutely in the new creation; with him, the old creation had been terminated, fired, and replaced, and now the new creation is here with Christ&mdash;Gal. 2:20; 6:15-18; cf. Rom. 6:4; 7:6.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In Isaiah 41 through 66 Christ is revealed as the Servant of Jehovah:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the book of Isaiah Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by three persons&mdash;by a Gentile king, Cyrus the king of Persia; by God&rsquo;s chosen corporate people, Israel; and by the prophet Isaiah; all three were God&rsquo;s servants in the sense of a type.</li>
	<li>Cyrus, Israel, and Isaiah all did the same thing to please God by serving to release God&rsquo;s people, to build up God&rsquo;s house, the temple, and to build up God&rsquo;s kingdom, signified by the city of Jerusalem; thus, they all typify Christ as God&rsquo;s Servant&mdash;Luke 4:18-21; Matt. 16:18-19.</li>
	<li>All who are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and who are thus one with Christ to release God&rsquo;s people and to build up His house and His kingdom are servants of God; those who are one with Christ have become a great corporate Christ (12:12; Col. 3:10-11), the same as the individual Christ in being the testimony and servant of God:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We need to be one with Christ to release God&rsquo;s people from the captivity of Satan back to the enjoyment of God as their possession; our preaching of the gospel is to release these captives to make them the sons of God, the members of Christ, and the constituents of the new man&mdash;Isa. 61:1-2; Luke 4:18-21; Matt. 12:28-29; Gal. 3:26; Rom. 12:4-5; Col. 3:10-11.</li>
		<li>We need to be one with Christ to release God&rsquo;s people from Babylon (apostate Christendom) and the principle of Babylon; anything that is Babylonian gives Satan the ground to defeat the people of God&mdash;Isa. 48:20; 41:21-29; Rev. 17:3-5; Josh. 7:21.</li>
		<li>We need to be one with Christ to build up the church as God&rsquo;s temple and as God&rsquo;s kingdom&mdash;Eph. 2:21-22; Matt. 16:18-19, 24; 1 Cor. 14:4b; Rom. 14:17-18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by Cyrus the king of Persia&mdash;Isa. 41:2, 25; 45:13, 1; 48:14; 46:11; 44:28:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Cyrus was raised up by Jehovah (41:2a, 25a; 45:13a; Acts 3:26a), anointed by Jehovah (Isa. 45:1a; Luke 4:18a), and loved by Jehovah (Isa. 48:14b; Matt. 3:17).</li>
	<li>He did God&rsquo;s pleasure on Babylon (Isa. 48:14; 46:11), symbolizing the Roman Catholic Church (Rev. 17:3-5).</li>
	<li>He was God&rsquo;s counselor (Isa. 46:11b) to subdue the nations and have dominion over the kings (41:2b, 25; 45:1b; Ezra 1:2a; Acts 5:31; Rev. 1:5a).</li>
	<li>As Jehovah&rsquo;s shepherd, Cyrus fulfilled the desires of Jehovah&mdash;Isa. 44:28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Cyrus served God by defeating Babylon, God&rsquo;s enemy (48:14), which had captured His people and destroyed the temple (2 Kings 24&mdash;25), by declaring the release of Israel from captivity, and by issuing a decree allowing the Jews to rebuild their temple in Jerusalem (Isa. 45:13; Ezra 1:2-3).</li>
		<li>These three things are types, signifying Christ&rsquo;s defeating Satan (Heb. 2:14), releasing His believers from Satan&rsquo;s captivity (Luke 4:18; Eph. 4:8), and building up the church as God&rsquo;s temple (Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21).</li>
		<li>In subduing Babylon and releasing the captives of Israel, and in charging Israel and supporting them to build up the temple and the city of their God (Ezra 1), Cyrus did God&rsquo;s pleasure&mdash;Isa. 48:14:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>God loves Israel, loves His kingdom, signified by the city of Jerusalem, and loves His house, signified by the temple.</li>
			<li>It was a matter of love for God to use a Gentile king to do what was in His heart; thus, God loved Cyrus&mdash;v. 14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by Israel&mdash;41:8-16; 42:1; 43:10; 44:1-5, 21; 49:3; 46:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Israel typifies Christ for the carrying out of the kind word of comfort spoken by Jehovah&mdash;40:1-2.</li>
	<li>Israel was chosen by Jehovah and upheld with the right hand of His righteousness&mdash;41:10.</li>
	<li>Israel overcame the enemies by Jehovah and rejoiced and gloried in Him, the Holy One of Israel&mdash;vv. 8-16; 42:1a; Rom. 8:37; 1 Thes. 2:19-20.</li>
	<li>Israel was the witness of Jehovah&mdash;Isa. 43:10; Rev. 1:5a; 3:14; Acts 1:8.</li>
	<li>The Spirit of Jehovah was poured out on Israel for the blessing of his offspring&mdash;Isa. 44:1-5, 21; Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18-19.</li>
	<li>Jehovah was glorified in Israel&mdash;Isa. 43:7; 49:3; 46:13b; John 17:1; 12:28:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Israel is God&rsquo;s servant in the sense of fulfilling God&rsquo;s desire in His economy to have a corporate expression of Himself for His glory&mdash;Isa. 43:7:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The people of Israel were to be used by God to express Him in a corporate way.</li>
			<li>In this sense Israel was one with Christ as God&rsquo;s servant&mdash;41:8; 45:4; 49:3; Hosea 11:1; cf. Matt. 2:15.</li>
			<li>The servant of Jehovah is corporate, and Israel was part of this corporate servant&mdash;Isa. 41:8.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>In the present age the church, as the testimony of God, serves God for the expression of God, the glory of God&mdash;Rev. 1:2; Eph. 3:21; Gal. 6:16.</li>
		<li>The glorification of God is the purpose of our service; the highest service we can render to God is to express Him in His glory&mdash;Eph. 1:23; 1 Cor. 10:31.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by the prophet Isaiah&mdash;Isa. 48:16; 49:1-4; 50:4-9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Isaiah typifies Christ as the Servant of Jehovah (Mark 10:45) for God&rsquo;s speaking (Deut. 18:15; John 3:34; 14:24):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Isaiah served God as His mouthpiece to speak forth His word, which is the embodiment of Himself&mdash;Isa. 49:1-4.</li>
		<li>Isaiah&rsquo;s prophesying helped in the release of Israel and the rebuilding of the temple and the city.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In verse 4 Isaiah typifies Christ:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>People judged Christ wrongly, thinking that His word was nothing and in vain; however, Christ was assured that the justice due to Him would come from God&mdash;1 Pet. 2:23.</li>
		<li>God values Christ&rsquo;s word (cf. Matt. 24:35) and will reward Him for His speaking.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Isaiah 50:4-5 speaks of the instruction received by Isaiah as a servant of Jehovah; thus, Isaiah typifies Christ in his receiving instructions from God.</li>

43:10-11; 44:8; Matt. 12:18-20</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The source of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is His divinity (Isa. 42:1, 6; 49:5, 7-8), whereas His qualification is in His humanity, in His human virtues (42:2-4).</li>
<li>Isaiah 52:13&mdash;53:12 reveals Christ as the Servant of Jehovah not in the Old Testament economy but in the New Testament economy; in the Old Testament, Isaiah 53 is the unique chapter that bears the color, taste, and atmosphere of the New Testament.</li>
<li>In the book of Isaiah we have a detailed prophecy concerning Christ as the Servant of Jehovah:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ is the One chosen and beloved of Jehovah; He is the One in whom Jehovah delights&mdash;42:1; Matt. 12:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, was God&rsquo;s choice among billions of human beings.</li>
		<li>Because He was God&rsquo;s choice, God delighted in Him; hence, He became the delight of God&rsquo;s heart&mdash;3:17; 17:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ had Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit upon Him&mdash;Isa. 42:1; Matt. 12:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit is Jehovah Himself; hence, Jehovah&rsquo;s putting His Spirit upon Jesus (3:16; Luke 4:18; John 1:33) meant that He gave Himself to Jesus and that Jehovah and Jesus, His Servant, are one.</li>
		<li>When Christ was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him as the economical power for His ministry; with Jehovah&rsquo;s Spirit upon Him, He announced justice to the nations&mdash;Isa. 42:1; Matt. 12:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ did not cry out or lift up His voice&mdash;Isa. 42:2; Matt. 12:19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Instead of crying out to make His voice heard in the street, the Lord Jesus was calm and quiet; He never made Himself great&mdash;cf. John 7:3-9.</li>
		<li>In His ministry the Lord Jesus did not strive with others, and He did not promote Himself; He had no fame, and He did not seek to make a name for Himself.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ would not break a bruised reed or quench dimly burning flax&mdash;Isa. 42:3; Matt. 12:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This indicates that He was full of mercy; no matter how much He was opposed, He kept open the door of mercy and grace.</li>
		<li>Today some of the Lord&rsquo;s people are like a bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound, and others are like dimly burning flax that cannot give a shining light; however, the Lord Jesus will not &ldquo;break&rdquo; the bruised ones, nor &ldquo;quench&rdquo; the ones like dimly burning flax.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus will select some bruised reeds and dimly burning flax and perfect them so that they become useful in His hand to bring forth justice unto victory&mdash;v. 20.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ was willing to be humiliated&mdash;Isa. 50:6; Matt. 26:67.</li>
	<li>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ was a man of sorrows, despised and forsaken of men; He was not a man of enjoyment and happiness, for His life was a life of sorrows and grief&mdash;Isa. 53:2-3.</li>
	<li>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ did not speak His own word&mdash;50:4-5:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Having the tongue of the instructed, He spoke according to God&rsquo;s instructions&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jehovah awakened Him every morning, awakening His ear to hear as an instructed one&mdash;v. 4.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus was never rebellious; rather, He was always obedient, listening to the word of God&mdash;v. 5.</li>
		<li>Because the Lord Jesus had the ear and the tongue of an instructed one, He knew how &ldquo;to sustain the weary with a word&rdquo;; such a word was able to minister life&mdash;v. 4a; John 6:63.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ trusted in God and set His face like a flint; in fulfilling God&rsquo;s purpose, He was strong&mdash;Isa. 50:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the matter of fulfilling God&rsquo;s will, Christ was very strong&mdash;John 6:38.</li>
		<li>As the Lord Jesus was walking in God&rsquo;s way to fulfill God&rsquo;s will, His face was like hard stone&mdash;Mark 10:32-34:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>When the time of His death was at hand, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah went to Jerusalem willingly, even going before His followers with a speed and boldness that amazed them&mdash;v. 32.</li>
			<li>This was His obedience to God unto death (Phil. 2:8), according to the counsel of God (Acts 2:23), for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s redemptive plan (Isa. 53:10).</li>
			<li>The Lord Jesus knew that through His death He would be glorified in resurrection (Luke 24:25-26) and that His divine life would be released to produce many brothers for His expression (John 12:23-24; Rom. 8:29).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>According to Isaiah 41:21-29, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is for the exposing of the falsehood and vanity of the idols:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Everything except Christ is false, vain, and an idol&mdash;42:8; 43:10-11; 46:5, 9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>According to 46:1-2 and 5-7 the idols of Babylon are powerless and useless and cannot be compared to Jehovah.</li>
		<li>Anything that replaces God or occupies the position of God is an idol; today&rsquo;s society encourages people to make idols.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In 1 John 5:21 <em>idols</em> refers to heretical substitutes for the true God and also to anything that replaces the real God; as genuine children of the genuine God, we should be on the alert to guard ourselves from heretical substitutes and from all vain replacements for our genuine and real God, with whom we are organically one and who is eternal life to us&mdash;v. 20.</li>
	<li>As those who are replaced by Christ and wait on Him to enjoy God&rsquo;s life power in grace, we are members of Christ and servants of Jehovah with Christ and in Christ in a corporate way; as members of Christ, we are types of Christ bearing a twofold testimony&mdash;Isa. 40:31; 1 Cor. 12:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We testify that we are nothing, that we have been &ldquo;fired&rdquo; and replaced by Christ, and that Christ is everything to us as our reality, centrality, and universality&mdash;John 14:6; Col. 1:18; 2:9, 16-17; 3:4, 10-11; Gal. 2:20.</li>
		<li>We also testify to the falsehood and vanity of the idols, the head of which is Satan, and to the fact that everything apart from Christ is false, vain, and an idol&mdash;Isa. 41:21-29.</li>
		<li>That Jehovah is the unique God can be proved only by a group of people who are His witnesses&mdash;43:10-11; 44:6, 8; Acts 1:8.</li>

1 Cor. 1:22-24; 2 Cor. 8:9; Mark 6:1-6</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The purpose of God&rsquo;s move in the stage of His incarnation is:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To bring God into man&mdash;Matt. 1:20-21, 23; Isa. 7:14; 9:6.</li>
	<li>To make God man that man may become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead&mdash;John 1:1, 14; 12:24.</li>
	<li>To mingle God with man that God and man may be one&mdash;Lev. 2:4-5.</li>
	<li>To accomplish God&rsquo;s redemption for man&mdash;Rom. 8:3; 1 Pet. 1:18-20; Heb. 9:26, 28, 12; 2:14.</li>
	<li>To carry out God&rsquo;s salvation in man&mdash;1 Tim. 1:15.</li>
	<li>To impart the divine life into man&mdash;1 John 4:9.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The incarnated Savior is the arm of Jehovah; the arm of Jehovah is God Himself in His saving power&mdash;Isa. 53:1b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the Lord Jesus came out to preach the gospel, that was the unveiling of the arm of Jehovah&mdash;Luke 4:14, 18-19; Mark 1:14-15.</li>
	<li>The Old Testament term is <em>the arm of Jehovah;</em> the New Testament term is <em>the power of God</em>&mdash;1 Cor. 1:24.</li>
	<li>Although Christ was unveiled as the arm of Jehovah, many did not see that He was Jehovah Himself coming in power to save them; they did not believe, because He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah and like a root out of dry ground&mdash;Isa. 53:2a; John 1:46; Matt. 13:55.</li>
	<li>When the Lord Jesus comes back, the remnant of Israel will repent and wail and be saved (Zech. 12:10-14; Rom. 11:26-27); at that time they will confess the contents of Isaiah 53, and this chapter will be full of taste to them.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As the complete God, signified by the arm of Jehovah, the power of God, Christ became a perfect man, signified by a man of sorrows&mdash;vv. 1b, 3a; John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim. 2:5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The arm of Jehovah is Jehovah in His power, and the man of sorrows is Jesus; when these two are added together, they equal incarnation.</li>
	<li>In 1 Corinthians 1:22-24 <em>Christ crucified</em> corresponds to the <em>man of sorrows</em> in Isaiah 53:3, and the <em>power of God</em> corresponds to the <em>arm of Jehovah</em> in verse 1.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>As a perfect man, the Lord Jesus lived a lowly and sorrowful human life&mdash;vv. 2-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>He grew up like a tender plant before Jehovah and like a root out of dry ground&mdash;v. 2a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The plant here refers to a sprout, which is tender, small, and delicate; because He was such a small, delicate person, no one would pay attention to Him.</li>
		<li>He grew up like a root out of dry ground, which signifies a difficult environment; this means that He was born of a poor family&mdash;v. 2a; Luke 2:21-24; cf. Lev. 12:8; 2 Cor. 8:9.</li>
		<li>The Lord Jesus was raised in the home of a poor carpenter in the despised town of Nazareth and in the despised region, Galilee; this was the fulfillment of the dry ground in Isaiah 53:2a.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s environment being one of dry ground means that His environment did not render Him any help at all:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Everything that He had was from God; He did not receive or expect anything from His surroundings that would encourage, support, or comfort Him.</li>
			<li>Our Lord had God&rsquo;s will as His satisfaction all His life; He was satisfied only with God&mdash;John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38.</li>
			<li>Our Lord was never discouraged (Isa. 42:4; 49:4); He had no hope toward the world and did not expect to receive anything from it; His only hope was in God, and His only satisfaction was in God.</li>
			<li>Those who take their satisfaction in God will never be disappointed&mdash;John 4:13-14.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>He had no attracting form nor majesty that men should look upon Him&mdash;Isa. 53:2b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus had neither an attracting form, nor did He have a beautiful appearance; He did not have any form or comeliness that would cause others to appreciate Him.</li>
		<li>Instead of majesty, Jesus had poverty (Matt. 8:20), and instead of an attractive form and a beautiful appearance, He had a visage and form that were marred (Isa. 52:14).</li>
		<li><em>Visage</em> denotes the appearance and also refers to the face or facial expression; Christ&rsquo;s face and His form were marred (disfigured) in order that He might save us; this is astonishing, different from what people expected Christ as a servant of God to be&mdash;v. 15.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ was despised and forsaken of men, like one from whom men hide their faces and whom men do not esteem&mdash;53:3.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus lived as a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; this was a part of Christ&rsquo;s qualifications for accomplishing redemption&mdash;v. 3a.</li>
	<li>He was a &ldquo;man whose chief distinction was, that His life was one of constant painful endurance&rdquo; (Keil and Delitzsch).</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s being such a man and His living such a lowly and sorrowful human life fully qualified Him to be the Redeemer and the Savior to save us from Satan, sin, death, and self&mdash;Heb. 2:14-18; Matt. 1:21; Rom. 8:3; 2 Tim. 1:10; Matt. 16:24-25.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Mark 6:1-6 may be regarded as a fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 53:2-3:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Nazarenes, blinded by their natural knowledge, knew the Lord Jesus according to the flesh, not according to the Spirit&mdash;Mark 6:2-3; 2 Cor. 5:16.</li>
	<li>Only in the Gospel of Mark is the Lord Jesus called a carpenter&mdash;6:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Carpentry is not a magnificent work, but it requires much fineness and patience; in such a work the Lord Jesus was found in fashion as a man (Phil. 2:8), not in loftiness but in lowliness, fineness, and patience.</li>
		<li>In Mark 6:3 the word <em>carpenter</em> is used in a despising manner:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Nazarenes were astounded by the Lord&rsquo;s teaching, by His wisdom, and by His works of power, but they regarded Him as a person of low status&mdash;vv. 2-3.</li>
			<li>They were stumbled in Him because, although they heard wonderful words out of His mouth and saw some of His marvelous deeds, they considered that He did not have a high status or degree.</li>
			<li>They saw the Lord Jesus as one who was merely a carpenter; therefore, they were stumbled in Him, and they despised Him.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The record in Mark 6:1-6 should cause us to ask ourselves what we want and what we value.</li>

In the Stage of His Crucifixion</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 53:4-10a, 12b</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>&#8220;Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows; / Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted. / But He was wounded because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed&#8221;-Isa. 53:4-5:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the report of the prophets and the revelation of Jehovah (v. 1), Christ is revealed as the crucified Redeemer, who sacrificed Himself for our trespasses (our sin) to accomplish Jehovah&#8217;s eternal redemption (vv. 4-10a; Heb. 9:12) that the believers in Christ may be redeemed (forgiven of sins-Acts 10:43, justified-13:39, and reconciled to God-Rom. 5:10), resulting in the life union with Christ in His resurrection (Isa. 53:10b), the reality of which is the life-giving Spirit (John 11:25; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:11).</li>
	<li>Sicknesses and sorrows, like transgressions and iniquities (Isa. 53:5), come from sin; hence, they too need Christ&#8217;s redemption (Psa. 103:1-3):
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>All healings accomplished on fallen people are a result of the Lord&#8217;s redemption; on the cross He took away our infirmities, bore our diseases, and accomplished full healing for us-Matt. 8:17.</li>
		<li>However, in this age the application of this divine healing power can be only a foretaste to us; in the coming age we will experience the full taste-Heb. 6:5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ bore our sicknesses at the time when He was judged by God on the cross, in the hour when God put all our iniquities on Him-Isa. 53:6b; 1 Pet. 2:24.</li>
	<li>Christ&#8217;s suffering of death healed our death so that we might live in His resurrection-v. 24.</li>
	<li>The experience of the children of Israel at Marah portrays that as we experience the cross of Christ and live a crucified life, Christ&#8217;s resurrection life becomes our healing power, and the Lord becomes our Healer-Exo. 15:22-26; 1 Pet. 2:24; Matt. 8:17; 9:12; Isa. 53:4-5; cf. 61:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Just as Moses saw a vision of a tree and cast this tree into the bitter waters, we need to see a vision of the crucified and resurrected Christ as the tree of life and apply Him to our bitter situations and our bitter being-Exo. 15:25-26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>First Peter 2:24 indicates that this tree signifies the cross of Christ, or the crucified Christ; the cross is the tree, and the One who died on the tree is our Healer-Exo. 15:25-26; cf. Gal. 3:13.</li>
			<li>This tree also signifies the resurrected Christ because the tree was cast into the bitter waters of Marah after the children of Israel had traveled three days in the wilderness-Exo. 15:22.</li>
			<li>The tree of life in Revelation 2:7 signifies the crucified (implied in the tree as a piece of wood-1 Pet. 2:24) and resurrected (implied in the life of God-John 11:25) Christ.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The crucified and resurrected Christ is the tree of life, and this tree is Jehovah our Healer, the One who heals the bitterness of our circumstances and the bitterness of our being, turning this bitterness into the sweet waters of His inward presence-Rev. 2:7; Exo. 15:22-26; 1 Pet. 2:24-25.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through Christ&#8217;s healing death and life-dispensing resurrection, He became the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls-vv. 24-25; Isa. 53:6; John 21:15-17.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&#8220;We all like sheep have gone astray; / Each of us has turned to his own way, / And Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him&#8221;-Isa. 53:6:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>It was when God was judging Jesus on the cross that He caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him, making Jesus, in the eyes of God, the unique sinner at that moment-Matt. 27:45-46; Psa. 22:1.</li>
	<li>Christ&#8217;s death was not merely a murder (Acts 7:52), nor was it a martyrdom; rather, it was carried out by God Himself according to His law.</li>
	<li>Thus, Christ died a vicarious death as the Substitute for sinners (1 Pet. 3:18), a death that was legal according to God&#8217;s law and was recognized and approved by God according to the law.</li>
	<li>The flesh of the passover lamb, typifying the crucified Christ, was to be roasted with fire and was not to be eaten raw or boiled-Exo. 12:8-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be roasted with fire signifies Christ&#8217;s suffering under the holy fire of God&#8217;s judgment-Isa. 53:4, 10; Psa. 22:14-15; John 19:28.</li>
		<li>To be eaten raw signifies not to believe in Christ&#8217;s redemption but to regard Him merely as an example of human life to be imitated.</li>
		<li>To be eaten boiled signifies regarding His death on the cross not as death for redemption but as the suffering of human persecution for martyrdom.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Just as the flesh of the passover lamb was to be eaten for life supply, so we need to eat Christ for our life supply-Exo. 12:8-10; John 6:53, 55-57; cf. Deut. 15:19-20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To solve the problem of the fall of man and to accomplish God&#8217;s original intention, both life and redemption are needed.</li>
		<li>God&#8217;s judicial redemption through the blood of Christ is the procedure to reach God&#8217;s goal of dispensing Christ as life into us for our organic salvation-Rom. 5:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&#8220;He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted, / Yet He did not open His mouth; / Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth. / By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; / And as for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due?&#8221;-Isa. 53:7-8:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In His vicarious death for sinners, Christ was oppressed, afflicted, and led to the slaughter like a lamb and sheared before the shearers like a sheep, with no reaction-Acts 8:32; Matt. 27:12-14.</li>
	<li>Christ was oppressed by the hypocritical Jewish leaders (26:57, 59, 65-68) and then judged by the unjust Roman officials (Luke 23:1-12; John 18:33-38; 19:1-16); by these two things He was taken away and crucified.</li>
	<li>No one among Christ&#8217;s generation understood that He was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of the prophet&#8217;s people, the Jews, to whom the stroke was due.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&#8220;And they assigned His grave with the wicked, / But with a rich man in His death, / Although He had done no violence, / Nor was there any deceit in His mouth&#8221;-Isa. 53:9:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Those who crucified Christ planned to bury Him with the two transgressors, the wicked ones (Luke 23:32-33), but eventually God in His sovereignty caused Christ to be buried in a rich man&#8217;s tomb (Matt. 27:57-60).</li>
	<li>The word for &#8220;death&#8221; in Isaiah 53:9 is plural in Hebrew, <em>deaths,</em> signifying &#8220;a violent death, the very pain of which makes it like dying again and again&#8221; (Keil and Delitzsch).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&#8220;But Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. / When He makes Himself an offering for sin&#8221;-v. 10a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Because Christ was crushed for our iniquities, Satan can be crushed under our feet (Rom. 16:20), and because He was afflicted with grief, we can be filled with His joy (John 16:20-22).</li>
	<li>Christ bore our sin in its totality, dying on the cross to be the reality of the sin offering and the trespass offering-1:29; cf. Heb. 10:5-10; 1 John 1:7-9; Lev. 4-5.</li>
	<li>Christ&#8217;s precious blood shed for the forgiveness of our sins is also the blood of the covenant; because of the blood of Jesus, we have boldness for entering the Holy of Holies, where we can enjoy God, behold His beauty, and receive His infusion-Matt. 26:28; Heb. 10:19-20; cf. Lev. 16:11-16; Psa. 27:4.</li>
	<li>Christ came into the death waters, was wounded by us and for our transgressions, and secretes His life into us to make us precious pearls for the building of God&#8217;s eternal expression-Isa. 53:5; Rev. 21:21; John 19:34.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&#8220;He poured out His life unto death / And was numbered with the transgressors, / Yet He alone bore the sin of many / And interceded for the transgressors&#8221;-Isa. 53:12b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man, God, and Christ all had a part in Christ&#8217;s crucifixion; man did the murdering, the killing (Acts 7:52), but God carried out the legal judgment to kill Christ as a legal Substitute so that Christ might die a vicarious death for sinners (Isa. 53:6b, 10a).</li>
	<li>Moreover, Christ Himself was willing to be such an offering; He made Himself that offering (v. 10b), and He poured out His life for that purpose (John 10:17-18; Heb. 9:14).</li>
	<li>When Christ was crucified on the cross, He was numbered with the transgressors, and He interceded for the transgressors-Luke 23:32-34a; cf. Heb. 7:25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He interceded for them regarding the evil of the transgressors, the result of their ignorance, a trespass that He prayed would be forgiven by God.</li>
		<li>Stephen prayed for his persecutors in the same way that his Lord, whom he loved and lived, had prayed for His-Acts 7:60.</li>

	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The seed and the issue mentioned in Isaiah 53:10c-11b imply a great deal&mdash;the various items concerning the produce of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection revealed in the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His resurrection, as the processed Christ, the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ, as the preeminent One, the One who has the first place in all things, became the Firstborn from the dead and the Head of the Body&mdash;Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5a.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ as the God-man, in His humanity, was begotten of God to be the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ as the resurrection life regenerated all His believers&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ, as the one grain of wheat, produced many grains; the many grains as the increase of Christ are the components of the one bread&mdash;the church, the Body of Christ&mdash;John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17; Eph. 1:22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through His life-releasing death and with His life-imparting resurrection, Christ produced a corporate seed as the issue of the travail of His soul, whom He saw in His resurrection and was satisfied&mdash;Isa. 53:10c-11b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the resurrected Life-giver, the Lord Jesus produced a seed for the building up of His Body as His continuation for Jehovah&rsquo;s pleasure and Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The thought of a life-giver is implied in the seed, which is produced by life.</li>
			<li>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is the Life-giver so that He can produce a seed&mdash;v. 10b:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) In resurrection He produced a seed for His satisfaction and for the Father&rsquo;s pleasure.</li>
				<li>2) The seed produced by Christ in His resurrection is His believers for the building up of His Body as His continuation&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The corporate seed implies all the many grains, all the members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, all Christ&rsquo;s brothers, and all the sons of God&mdash;John 20:17; Heb. 2:10.</li>
			<li>The Father is pleased with the Body of Christ, which is constituted with the seed brought forth by Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-13; 15:45b.</li>
			<li>Christ has extended His days by producing a seed to build up His Body, and this Body is still extending&mdash;Isa. 53:10c-11:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) This seed is Christ&rsquo;s continuation for the extension of His days&mdash;Rev. 1:18a.</li>
				<li>2) Because Christ continues to live by living in us, we are the extension of His days&mdash;John 14:19; Gal. 2:20.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>This seed is for the pleasure of Jehovah, which will prosper in the hand of the resurrected Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9; Phil. 2:13; Isa. 53:10c.</li>
		<li>The resurrected Christ, the righteous One, will make the many righteous (v. 11b; Acts 13:39); this is not merely to justify us objectively but to make us righteous subjectively (2 Cor. 5:21) by living within us as the resurrection life.</li>
		<li>Christ will see the issue of the travail of His soul and be satisfied; this issue refers to the many who are justified (made righteous) by knowing Christ, for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ&mdash;Isa. 53:11; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Isaiah 53 speaks of the all-inclusive Christ in the stage of His ascension&mdash;v. 12a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Christ&rsquo;s ascension there was a demonstration of Christ&rsquo;s victory by the sharing of the spoil, the captives, taken in Christ&rsquo;s victory&mdash;v. 12a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word <em>spoil</em> in Isaiah 53:12a opens a wide window to us, enabling us to see the invisible scene of a war&mdash;Col. 2:15; 1 Pet. 3:18; Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>Spoil</em> indicates that there was a war, for spoil signifies prey, and prey denotes captives taken in war&mdash;Eph. 4:8.</li>
			<li><em>Spoil</em> indicates that a war was fought and someone won that war, and the winner got the spoil, the prey, the captives.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ won the war and then divided the spoil with the Great and the Strong&mdash;Isa. 53:12a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>The Great</em> and <em>the Strong</em> refer to God; in the whole universe only God is great and only God is strong.</li>
			<li>As the Great, God received the honor from Christ&rsquo;s ascension, and as the Strong, He gained the victory.</li>
			<li>God the Father was the Great and the Strong, and God the Son was the Fighter:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Christ fought the battle on the cross and in His resurrection, and by winning the battle He captured all Satan&rsquo;s captives as the spoil&mdash;Col. 2:15; Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18.</li>
				<li>2) In His ascension Christ, the Fighter, and God, the Great and the Strong, shared the spoil with each other.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:8-12 reveals that when Christ ascended to the heavens, He led a procession of captives, who were originally the captives of Satan, bringing them to the heavens and presenting them to the Father.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s ascension consummates in the accomplishment of the work of God for His new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Rev. 21:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is producing His new creation out of His old creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The new creation is the old creation transformed by the divine life, and thus it has God within it as its life, nature, constitution, appearance, and expression&mdash;Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rev. 4:2-3; 21:2, 9-11.</li>
			<li>The new creation is created altogether in Christ, by Christ, through Christ, and with Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Eph. 3:17.</li>
			<li>The continuing work of constituting the new creation is being carried out in the heavens in Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry&mdash;Heb. 8:1-2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The work of God for His new creation is to complete the constitution of the New Jerusalem to be God&rsquo;s corporate expression and the saints&rsquo; blessing for eternity&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 9-11; 22:3-5, 14, 17.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>God&rsquo;s full salvation is based on His righteousness and consummated in His life&mdash;Rom. 10:3; 3:21-28; 5:10, 17-18, 21; 1:16-17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The righteousness of God is what God is with respect to justice and righteousness&mdash;10:3; 3:21-23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because we are fallen, God must deal with us according to His righteousness.</li>
		<li>As the righteous God, He cannot forgive sinful people without meeting the demands of His righteousness&mdash;1 John 1:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Justification is God&rsquo;s action in approving us according to His standard of righteousness&mdash;Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:28.</li>
	<li>The proof of God&rsquo;s justification is the resurrection of Christ&mdash;4:22-25:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The redeeming death of Christ as the ground for God to justify us has been fully accepted by God, and Christ has been resurrected as a proof of this.</li>
		<li>The resurrected Christ who sits at the right hand of God is the evidence that God is satisfied with Christ&rsquo;s death on our behalf and that we have been justified&mdash;1 John 2:1.</li>
		<li>Now that Christ has died and has been raised from the dead, it is impossible for God to change His mind about forgiving us; He is bound by His righteousness to forgive us&mdash;1:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God has given Christ to us as the righteousness of God&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30.</li>
	<li>Our experience of Christ rests upon the foundation of God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;Psa. 89:14.</li>
	<li>Whereas God&rsquo;s righteousness justifies us through the death of Christ, God&rsquo;s life germinates us by Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;Rom. 10:3; Gal. 2:16, 21; Rom. 5:10, 18; Eph. 2:5; 1 Cor. 15:45b.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ has been called by Jehovah to be a covenant for the people&mdash;Isa. 42:6b; 49:8b; Heb. 7:22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The covenant is the legal agreement between God and His people (cf. Jer. 31:31-34; Heb. 8:8-12); through the death of Christ, the covenant became a testament, a will (9:16-17).</li>
	<li>A covenant and a testament are the same, but when the maker of the covenant is living, it is a covenant, and when he has died, it is a testament; a testament in today&rsquo;s terms is a will.</li>
	<li>A covenant is an agreement containing some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people, while a testament is a will containing certain accomplished things that are bequeathed to the inheritor&mdash;vv. 16-17; cf. Deut. 11:29; 28:1, 15; Jer. 31:31-32.</li>
	<li>Christ enacted the new covenant (which became the new testament&mdash;the will) with His blood according to God&rsquo;s righteousness through His redeeming death&mdash;Matt. 26:28; Luke 22:20; Heb. 9:15.</li>
	<li>In resurrection, Christ became the reality of all the bequests of the new testament, and in ascension in His heavenly ministry, He is the Mediator, the Executor, to execute the new testament according to God&rsquo;s righteousness&mdash;8:6; 9:15; 12:24.</li>
	<li>Therefore, Christ is the new covenant as the new testament; as the embodiment of the riches of the Godhead (Col. 2:9; 1:19) and as the crucified and resurrected One, He has become the covenant of God given to His people.</li>
	<li>Christ as God&rsquo;s sure mercies is the reality of all that God is and of all that God has given us; God&rsquo;s salvation, God&rsquo;s righteousness, God&rsquo;s justification, God&rsquo;s forgiveness, God&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s riches, and all God has and will do have been covenanted to us&mdash;Isa. 55:1-4; Acts 13:34-35.</li>
	<li>As the reality of all the bequests in the new testament, Christ, who is the all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, consummated Spirit, is in our spirit and has become one spirit with us&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:9-11; 2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17.</li>
	<li>As a covenant Christ is the surety (Heb. 7:22), and the Spirit is the pledge (2 Cor. 1:22; Eph. 1:14), to guarantee that God embodied in Christ is the inheritance to His people (Rom. 8:17a; Acts 26:18).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ has been called by Jehovah to be a light for the nations&mdash;Isa. 42:6b-7; Matt. 4:13-16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ is the light of life, the true light, that shines over the world and enlightens every man to enliven man for regeneration&mdash;John 1:4, 9, 12-13.</li>
	<li>He is the divine, marvelous light to open the eyes of the blind (Isa. 42:7a; Luke 4:18; John 9:14) and to deliver God&rsquo;s chosen people out of the darkness of death, the death-realm, the authority of Satan, into God&rsquo;s life-realm of light (Isa. 42:7b; 1 Pet. 2:9b; Acts 26:18a; Col. 1:12-13).</li>
	<li>Christ as the covenant is for God&rsquo;s people to gain God with His riches as their inheritance, whereas Christ as the light is for God&rsquo;s people to receive God as life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The condemnation of God is dissolved by Christ as the covenant, and the death that comes from Satan is annulled by Christ as the light that issues in life&mdash;John 8:12.</li>
		<li>Christ as God&rsquo;s life germinates us to regenerate, sanctify, renew, transform, conform, and glorify us, organically saving us unto our full sonship for His complete expression&mdash;Rom. 5:10.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah serves God&rsquo;s people by being a covenant and a light to God&rsquo;s chosen people that He may be the full salvation of God extending to the ends of the earth&mdash;Isa. 49:6, 8b-9a; 42:5-7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Righteousness in God&rsquo;s justice and life through God&rsquo;s light are the two basic factors of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;vv. 1, 4; Rom. 1:16-17; 5:18b; Titus 3:7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s salvation in its two aspects is composed of Christ as the covenant for justification and Christ as the light for life&mdash;Rom. 5:10.</li>
		<li>Through His death Christ as the covenant satisfies God&rsquo;s righteousness for justification as the base of God&rsquo;s full salvation, and in His resurrection Christ as the light imparts life as the consummation of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</li>
		<li>Through His death and in His resurrection Christ has become the new covenant as the new testament according to God&rsquo;s righteousness to be the base of God&rsquo;s full salvation&mdash;Heb. 8:10-12; 9:15-17.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>God gave Christ as a light to the nations that He might be God&rsquo;s salvation to all the world&mdash;Matt. 4:16; Luke 2:30-32:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The life of this light (John 1:4; 8:12), as the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16b), the incorruptible life (2 Tim. 1:10b), and the real and eternal life that we should lay hold on (1 Tim. 6:19, 12), becomes God&rsquo;s salvation to us in His righteousness (Rom. 5:10, 17).</li>
		<li>This life also ensures us, guarantees us, the heirs of God in His life, the right to inherit God with all His riches as our eternal inheritance&mdash;Acts 26:18.</li>
		<li>Such a life of light grows in us continually, issuing in our church life today (Eph. 5:8) and consummating in the New Jerusalem in eternity (Rev. 21:2-3, 9b-11, 18-23; 22:1-5).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The New Jerusalem is the embodiment of God&rsquo;s full salvation, and God&rsquo;s full salvation is a composition of God&rsquo;s righteousness as the base and God&rsquo;s life as the consummation:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The totality of what the Bible reveals to us is the New Jerusalem; the New Jerusalem is the total composition of the entire revelation of the Bible.</li>
	<li>Ultimately, the complete salvation of God is embodied in the New Jerusalem, which is a matter of life built on the foundation of righteousness&mdash;Rev. 22:1-2; 21:2, 10, 14, 19-20, 23:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The foundation of the New Jerusalem is the righteousness of God with God&rsquo;s faithfulness&mdash;vv. 19-20.</li>
		<li>The content of the New Jerusalem is life, which issues from light&mdash;v. 23.</li>
		<li>Life is the consummation of righteousness, and righteousness is the base, the foundation, of life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>For His chosen people to receive Christ as a covenant and as light, God, as the Creator of the heavens and the earth and as the One who gives breath to men, gives also spirit to them that they may be able to enjoy Him, the Triune God, who is Spirit, as their inheritance and life&mdash;Isa. 42:5; Gen. 2:7; Zech. 12:1; John 4:24a.</li>
<li>The way to receive and enjoy the full salvation of God is to exercise our spirit, live according to our spirit, and remain in our spirit, with which is Christ, by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name&mdash;Rom. 8:4; 10:12-13; Psa. 116:13; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>
<li>God&rsquo;s full salvation is full of springs, and we need to learn to draw water out of these springs by calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name&mdash;Isa. 12:2-6; 55:1-4, 6.</li>

<h1 class="title">The Intrinsic Significance<br />
of Keeping the Sabbath and of Fasting</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 55:1; 56:2;<br />
57:15, 20-21; 58:8-14; 66:1-2</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The real meaning of keeping the Sabbath is that we cease from our doing, stop our work, get ourselves &ldquo;fired,&rdquo; and enjoy what the Lord has done for us, drinking of Him, the consummated Spirit, as the waters&mdash;Isa. 56:2; 12:3; 55:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Keeping the Sabbath in this way is to be terminated and replaced by Christ so that we may enter into Him and rest in Him for eternity.</li>
	<li>To believe in the Lord Jesus is to keep the Sabbath; on the day we were saved, we were &ldquo;fired&rdquo; and replaced with Christ.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself up for me&rdquo; (Gal. 2:20)&mdash;this is the keeping of the Sabbath.</li>
	<li>The entire Christian life should be such a Sabbath&mdash;Heb. 4:9, footnote 1, Recovery Version.</li>
	<li>This extended Sabbath becomes a feast in which we cease from our doing and are replaced with Christ.</li>
	<li>The more we realize that it is no longer we who live but that it is Christ who lives in us, the more we drink of the waters.</li>
	<li>On the seventh day, the Sabbath, God rested because He had finished His work and was satisfied; God&rsquo;s glory was manifested because man had His image, and His authority was about to be exercised for the subduing of His enemy, Satan; as long as man expresses God and deals with God&rsquo;s enemy, God can rest&mdash;Gen. 1:26, 31; 2:2-3; Rom. 5:17, 21; 16:20:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God&rsquo;s seventh day, the Sabbath, was man&rsquo;s first day; God had prepared everything for man&rsquo;s enjoyment.</li>
		<li>After man was created, he did not join in God&rsquo;s work; he entered into God&rsquo;s rest; man was created not to work but to be satisfied with God and rest with God.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light&rdquo;&mdash;Matt. 11:28-30:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Toil refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work; whoever toils thus is always heavily burdened.</li>
		<li>Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law or religion or under any work or responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction.</li>
		<li>To take the Lord&rsquo;s yoke is to take the will of the Father; it is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father&mdash;John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38.</li>
			<li>He submitted Himself fully to the Father&rsquo;s will (Matt. 26:39, 42); hence, He asks us to learn from Him.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>To be meek, or gentle, means not to resist opposition, and to be lowly means not to have self-esteem:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Throughout all the opposition the Lord was meek, and throughout all the rejection He was lowly in heart.</li>
			<li>He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself.</li>
			<li>Hence, regardless of the situation He had rest in His heart; He was fully satisfied with the Father&rsquo;s will.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The rest that we find by taking the Lord&rsquo;s yoke and learning from Him is for our souls; it is an inward rest and is not anything merely outward in nature.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s yoke is the Father&rsquo;s will, and His burden is the work of carrying out the Father&rsquo;s will; such a yoke is easy, not bitter, and such a burden is light, not heavy.</li>
		<li>His yoke being easy means that His yoke, the Father&rsquo;s will, is good, kind, mild, gentle, pleasant&mdash;in contrast to hard, harsh, sharp, bitter.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The real meaning of fasting is to stop eating all things other than the Lord Jesus and to not have a taste for anything other than Him:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We need to fast, to cease from all other kinds of eating, to stop the taste for all other foods, and to eat Jesus as the bread of life embodied in His word&mdash;John 6:48, 51, 63, 68.</li>
	<li>The evil condition of the wicked is that they do not come to the Lord to eat and enjoy the Lord&mdash;Isa. 57:20-21; cf. 55:1-2, 6-7:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>They do many things, but they do not come to contact the Lord, to take Him, to receive Him, to taste Him, and to enjoy Him.</li>
		<li>In the sight of God, nothing is more evil than this&mdash;Jer. 2:13.</li>
		<li>The wicked ones do many things, but they cannot have peace, because they do not contact the Lord, rest in Him, and remain in His presence&mdash;Isa. 57:20-21.</li>
		<li>We need to learn at every moment and during every action to touch, taste, eat, and enjoy the Lord.</li>
		<li>We should not only touch the Lord but also be touched by Him.</li>
		<li>The way to have a real revival is to contact the Lord with a contrite and humble spirit&mdash;v. 15; 66:1-2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we fast by ceasing from the taste for anything other than Christ, we have an appetite only for Christ, and we do not eat anything other than Christ.</li>
	<li>God intends to reconstitute His people by changing their diet; His aim is to eliminate every trace of our Egyptian, worldly, constitution in order to make our constitution purely of Christ&mdash;Exo. 16:3-4, 14-36; John 6:32-35, 48-51, 57, 63:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Whatever we desire, hunger, and thirst after is the diet according to which our being has been constituted; whatever satisfies, strengthens, and sustains us is our food; the unique food we take for our sustenance, strength, and satisfaction must be Christ&mdash;Num. 11:4-6.</li>
		<li>The Lord desires to take away the desire and hunger for anything other than Christ; Christ as the heavenly manna nourishes us, heals us, and eliminates the negative things in us to reconstitute us with Himself.</li>
		<li>Only those who are reconstituted with Christ by eating Him become the dwelling place of God; may the Lord change our diet so that we may be reconstituted with Christ and become God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Isaiah 58 describes the hypocrisy of the house of Jacob and Jehovah&rsquo;s instruction to them; they fasted outwardly, but they did many things in pursuit of their own interests; they did not rest in God or take Him as their nourishment and life supply:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Verses 8 and 9a say that if we fast in the way of contacting the Lord, taking Him as our nourishment and sustaining power, our light will break forth like the dawn: &ldquo;Then your light will break forth like the dawn, / And your recovery will speedily spring forth. / And your righteousness will go before you; / The glory of Jehovah will guard you from behind. / Then you will call, and Jehovah will answer; / You will cry out, and He will say, Here I am.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Verse 9b says that if we fast in the proper way, we will remove the yoke from our midst, the pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness.</li>
	<li>Verse 10a goes on to say that we will also draw out our soul to the hungry and satisfy the desires of the afflicted; this is to be merciful to others and to sympathize with them.</li>
	<li>Verses 10b through 12 say that those who fast in the right way will be full of light and life, they will be useful, and they will enable others to go on: &ldquo;Then your light will rise in the darkness, / And your gloom will be like midday; / And Jehovah will guide you continually, / And satisfy your soul in the dry times, / And strengthen your bones; / And you will be like a watered garden, / And like a spring of water, / Whose waters do not deceive. / And those who are of you will rebuild the ancient ruins; / You will raise up the foundations of generation upon generation; / And you will be called the repairer of the breach, / The restorer of the paths in which to dwell.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>In verse 13 Jehovah instructs the house of Jacob not to do whatever they please on His holy day; they were to call the Sabbath a delight and honor it, not doing their own ways, nor finding their own pleasure and speaking idle words; they were to keep the Sabbath by enjoying God, having been fired and replaced by Him.</li>
	<li>Verse 14 says that if they honor the Sabbath, they will have delight in Jehovah, and He will cause them to ride upon the heights of the earth, and He will feed them with the inheritance of Jacob their father.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God wants us to learn one lesson&mdash;to stop our doing, taking Christ as our replacement, and to keep away from the taste of anything other than Christ:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should be replaced by Christ and enjoy God continually; this is the purpose for which Christ died for us and was resurrected for us.</li>
	<li>He is our Sabbath and our food; now we can rest in Him, feed on Him, and have Him as our replacement in every way and in everything.</li>
	<li>In the New Jerusalem for eternity, we will have a life of resting and fasting:

		<li>Having been fully &ldquo;fired,&rdquo; we will not work but will be at rest; this will be the situation of everyone in the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2; Isa. 66:12.</li>
		<li>Our unique food will be Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as the tree of life&mdash;Rev. 22:1-2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>By resting and fasting we can partake of all that the processed Christ has accomplished for us; in totality, what He is and has accomplished is just the divine water, which is the consummated Spirit for our enjoyment&mdash;Isa. 55:1; 1 Cor. 12:13.</li>
	<li>When we heard the gospel and received the Lord Jesus, we immediately began to keep the Sabbath and to fast; now we should be &ldquo;fired&rdquo; again and replaced by Christ more and more, resting in Him and fasting from every taste other than Him.</li>
	<li>According to the divine revelation in the Scriptures, we all need to learn to keep the Sabbath and to fast.</li>

John 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1; 7:17</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>In the Scriptures there is a line concerning the river of water of life&mdash;Gen. 2:10; Psa. 36:8-9; 46:4; John 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The river in Genesis 2:10 signifies the river of water of life, along which the tree of life grows; this river quenches man&rsquo;s thirst.</li>
	<li>In Psalm 36:8-9 the fountain refers to the Father as the source of life, and the river refers to the Spirit as the river of water of life&mdash;John 1:4; 7:37-39.</li>
	<li>The river in Psalm 46:4 signifies the flow of the Triune God in Christ through the Spirit as life to God&rsquo;s people.</li>
	<li>Revelation 22:1 speaks of the river of water of life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The river, typified by the rivers in Genesis 2:10-14, Psalm 46:4, and Ezekiel 47:5-9, signifies the abundance of life in its flow; as indicated in John 7:38, this one river with its riches becomes many rivers in our experience of the different aspects of the riches of God&rsquo;s Spirit of life&mdash;Rom. 8:2; 15:30; 1 Thes. 1:6; 2 Thes. 2:13; Gal. 5:22-23.</li>
		<li>The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply; it is typified by the water that flowed out of the riven rock (Exo. 17:6; Num. 20:11) and symbolized by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus (John 19:34).</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s good pleasure, the desire of His heart, is to be the fountain of living waters to dispense Himself into His chosen people so that they would become His increase as His fullness for His expression&mdash;Jer. 2:13; Eph. 1:4-5, 9, 22-23; 3:16-19:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God&rsquo;s intention was to dispense Himself into man as man&rsquo;s enjoyment and satisfaction for God&rsquo;s corporate expression, but man became unfaithful and forsook God for idols&mdash;Jer. 2:13.</li>
	<li>Israel should have drunk of God as the fountain of living waters so that they might become His expression, but Israel fell by forsaking God as the fountain of living waters and turning to a source other than God, signified by the cisterns, which Israel labored to hew out for themselves&mdash;v. 13.</li>
	<li>Apart from God as the fountain of living waters, nothing can quench our thirst and satisfy us&mdash;John 4:14; 6:35; 7:37-38; Rev. 22:17.</li>
	<li>Nothing apart from God Himself as the fountain of living waters can make us His increase for His corporate expression&mdash;Rom. 8:2, 10-11; 12:4-5.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In the book of Isaiah, God considers that He is our salvation as living waters&mdash;12:3; 55:1-2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show that God&rsquo;s practical salvation is the processed Triune God Himself as the living water&mdash;Isa. 12:2-3; 55:1; Rev. 7:10, 14, 17; 21:6; 22:1, 17.</li>
	<li>To be our salvation, the Triune God was processed to become the life-giving Spirit as the living water, the water of life&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; John 7:37-39:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The waters in Isaiah 55:1 and Revelation 22:17 are the redeeming God, the very God who accomplished redemption for us through His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</li>
		<li>In totality, what Christ is and has accomplished is just the divine water, which is the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God for us to drink and enjoy&mdash;Isa. 55:1; John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to enjoy our God as living water, even as the waters&mdash;Isa. 55:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Isaiah 55 the most striking word is <em>waters;</em> this word reveals that we may enjoy God not only in one aspect but in many aspects&mdash;v. 1.</li>
	<li>The thought here is similar to that in John 7:38, which speaks of rivers of living water flowing out of the innermost being of the one who believes into the Lord Jesus; these rivers are the many flows of the different aspects of the divine life.</li>
	<li>In order to enjoy God as the waters by continually drinking of Him, we, who are sinners, need redemption:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This redemption is revealed in Isaiah 53, a chapter that reveals more of God&rsquo;s dynamic redemption than any other chapter of the Bible.</li>
		<li>The record concerning this accomplished redemption in chapter 53 is followed in chapter 55 by the invitation to the thirsty ones to come to the waters and drink&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The call in Isaiah 55:1 is like that in Revelation 22:17, where the Spirit and the bride yearn that the thirsty sinner will come to take the water of life for his satisfaction.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The waters are both the eternal covenant and the sure mercies shown to David&mdash;Isa. 55:1, 3-4:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>As the embodiment of the Triune God as the living waters (John 4:10, 14; 7:37-38), Christ is an eternal covenant to Israel (Isa. 42:6; 49:8; 54:10; 61:8b), even the sure mercies shown to David&mdash;55:1-3.</li>
	<li>Christ is both the sure mercies and the eternal covenant that guarantees these mercies&mdash;vv. 3-4:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Because our situation was miserable and we could not match God&rsquo;s grace, Christ, the embodiment of God&rsquo;s grace (John 1:14, 17), became the sure mercies, and through these mercies we are now in the proper position to match God and receive Him as grace (Eph. 2:4).</li>
		<li>In Christ as the sure mercies, God reaches us in His grace to be our enjoyment&mdash;John 1:1, 4, 14, 16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In eternity Christ the Lamb as our Shepherd will guide us to springs of waters of life&mdash;Rev. 7:17:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li><em>Springs of waters of life</em> refers to many different springs as waters of life, and, as in John 7:38 and Revelation 22:1, it refers to the unique water of life in different aspects; this indicates that there will be a unique river of water of life that issues in many rivers for our enjoyment.</li>
	<li>As the Lamb shepherds and guides us to springs of waters of life, He brings us into God Himself, and we gain the supply of living water, which is God Himself&mdash;7:17.</li>
	<li>We need to praise the Lord for bringing us to the church, where there is a fountain that is God Himself, the source of living water&mdash;Psa. 36:8-9:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>This living water flows unceasingly so that it fills us to the point of overflowing&mdash;John 4:14; 7:38.</li>
		<li>When we are full of this thirst-quenching water, we can overcome whatever comes across our path; by the living water out of the springs, we can overcome all things&mdash;Rev. 7:17; 3:21.</li>

<li>The central thought of the Scriptures is that God is seeking a building as a living composition of persons redeemed by and mingled with Himself&mdash;Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:21-22; 4:16:

	<li>The principle of God&rsquo;s building is that God builds Himself into us and builds us into Himself; that is, God mingles Himself with us as one building&mdash;John 14:20; 15:4; 1 John 4:15; Eph. 3:17a; Rev. 21:3, 22.</li>
	<li>God&rsquo;s building is the corporate expression of the Triune God&mdash;1 Tim. 3:15-16; John 17:22; Eph. 3:19b, 21.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The Lord Jehovah desires to have as His dwelling place a group of people into whom He can enter&mdash;Isa. 57:15; 66:1-2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God intends to have a dwelling place in the universe that is the mingling of God and man, in which God is built into man and man is built into God, so that God and man, man and God, can be a mutual abode to each other&mdash;John 14:2, 20, 23; 15:4; 1 John 4:13.</li>
	<li>In the New Testament this dwelling place, this house, is the church, which is God&rsquo;s habitation in the believers&rsquo; spirit&mdash;Eph. 2:22; 1 Tim. 3:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord looks to the one who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and He dwells with the contrite and lowly of spirit, to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite&mdash;Isa. 66:1-2; 57:15.</li>
		<li>For the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the Lord is one with our spirit, and our spirit is one with the Lord; our spirit is where the building of the church, the dwelling place of God, takes place&mdash;1 Cor. 6:17; Eph. 2:22.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The ultimate consummation of this universal building, this universal house, is the New Jerusalem; in this city God is in man, taking man as His dwelling place, and man is in God, taking God as his habitation&mdash;Rev. 21:3, 22; Gen. 28:12, 17; 2 Sam. 7:12-14.</li>

		</ol></li>
	<li>In the church as a house of prayer, we pray for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s desire, the carrying out of God&rsquo;s will, and the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1 Kings 8:48; Dan. 9:1-23; John 15:7; Matt. 6:10; Eph. 3:14-21; 5:27; Rev. 14:1; 21:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In the church as a house of prayer, we pray according to God&rsquo;s desire and thought; such prayer is precious and weighty, and it will shake the gates of Hades and affect Satan&mdash;Dan. 9:1-23.</li>
		<li>The prayer that is pleasing to God is the prayer that asks for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s will and for the completion of God&rsquo;s work&mdash;Matt. 6:10; Col. 1:9; 4:12; Isa. 45:11; 62:6-7; Ezek. 36:37.</li>
		<li>Our prayer in the church as a house of prayer should be for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy; the Holy Land, the holy city, and the holy temple are three crucial things regarding God&rsquo;s economy&mdash;1 Kings 8:48; Dan. 6:10.</li>
		<li>The prayer in the church as a house of prayer is in the position of ascension, and with this position of prayer there is the authority of prayer; when we have the heavenly position and authority, our prayers become God&rsquo;s administration, the executing of God&rsquo;s will&mdash;Eph. 2:6; Matt. 6:9-10.</li>
		<li>In the church as a house of prayer, we pray in an executing way, binding on the earth what has been bound in heaven and loosing on the earth what has been loosed in heaven; this is the prayer of the Body; we can have this kind of prayer only when we ask &ldquo;in harmony&rdquo;&mdash;18:18-19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The central subject and goal of prayer in the church as a house of prayer is to prepare a glorious church for Christ, a church that will match Him and fulfill the desire of His heart&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9; 3:14-21; 5:27.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Jehovah will beautify the house of His beauty so that He may be beautified&mdash;Isa. 60:7, 9, 13, 19; Psa. 50:2:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Your eyes will see the King in His beauty&rdquo; (Isa. 33:17a); &ldquo;the King will desire your beauty&rdquo; (Psa. 45:11a).</li>

	<li>In the corporate constitution of the Body of Christ, there is much beauty, excellency, and virtue&mdash;Eph. 1:22-23; 4:16.</li>
	<li>The New Jerusalem will be the ultimate, corporate expression of the Triune God, full of beauty&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 10-11.</li>
	<li>The virtues manifested by us Christians should be the manifestation of the glory and beauty in the divine attributes; a Christian is one who has divinity as his element and reality, from which the divine glory and beauty are expressed through the human virtues&mdash;1 Cor. 10:31; Phil. 1:20-21a; 4:5, 8.</li>
	<li>In Song of Songs the lover and the Beloved both have beauty, and they appreciate the beauty in each other&mdash;1:15-16; 4:1-5, 7.</li>
	<li>As the bride, the church needs beauty&mdash;Eph. 5:27:

	<li>Eternal glory is the ultimate goal of God&rsquo;s salvation; God&rsquo;s salvation leads us into His glory&mdash;Rom. 8:21; Heb. 2:10.</li>
	<li>The Lord Jesus prayed for the believers&rsquo; oneness in the divine glory for the corporate expression of God&mdash;John 17:22-23:

	<li>The church today should have God&rsquo;s glory, manifesting and expressing Him in this marvelous divine attribute; God&rsquo;s glory is wrought into the church, and He is expressed in the church; hence, God is glorified in the church&mdash;Eph. 3:21.</li>

<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Isaiah 61:1-3 refers to the ministry of Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah in His two comings:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Verses 1 and 2a in this chapter refer to Christ in His first coming, in which His ministry was to announce the gospel of grace.</li>
	<li>Verses 2b and 3 refer to Christ in His second coming, in which His ministry will be to avenge Israel that they may be restored.</li>
	<li>The prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah was fulfilled as a foretaste at Christ&rsquo;s first coming, for the age of grace as the acceptable year of Jehovah, the New Testament jubilee, resulting in the producing and building up of the church.</li>
	<li>This prophecy will be fulfilled as a full taste at Christ&rsquo;s second coming, for the restoration of Israel unto the new heavens and the new earth&mdash;65:17; 66:22.</li>
	<li>The age of jubilee is divided into two periods&mdash;one period is the New Testament age, which is the age of grace today, and the other period is the age of the millennium, which is the fullness of the jubilee.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The year of jubilee in Leviticus 25:8-17 is recorded as a prophecy in Isaiah 61:1-2a and is fulfilled in reality in Luke 4:16-22:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the year of jubilee there were two main blessings&mdash;the returning of every man to his lost possession and the liberation from slavery&mdash;Lev. 25:8-17.</li>
	<li>The Hebrew word for <em>jubilee</em> means a joyful noise, a shouting with the blasting of a trumpet, and a proclamation; it is a proclamation not of sorrow or lamentation but of the gospel, the good news of great joy&mdash;Luke 2:10-11.</li>
	<li>The year of jubilee is the age of grace, the age of Christ as grace dispensed into us for our enjoyment by His words of grace&mdash;4:22; Psa. 45:2; John 1:14-17.</li>
	<li>The New Testament jubilee is an age of ecstasy for our salvation&mdash;cf. 2 Cor. 5:13-15; 6:2.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The proclamation of the jubilee in Luke 4 governs the central thought of the whole Gospel of Luke, and the parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15 is an excellent illustration of the jubilee&mdash;vv. 11-32:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The prodigal son left his father&rsquo;s house, selling his possession and himself:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Human life is nothing but labor and sorrow and will be soon gone; the true condition of human life is vanity of vanities, vapor of vapors, and futility of futilities&mdash;a chasing after wind&mdash;Psa. 90:10; 73:14, 16-17, 25; Eccl. 1:2-11, 14.</li>
		<li>Today fallen people have no real dwelling place; they are drifting about and wandering without a home, because God is man&rsquo;s real dwelling place&mdash;Psa. 90:1; Gen. 28:17-19; John 15:4; Matt. 11:28.</li>
		<li>The fall of man is a fall from God; the people of the world have lost God as their possession and enjoyment&mdash;Psa. 16:5; Rom. 9:21-23; Eph. 2:12.</li>
		<li>Also, fallen people have sold their members to sin to become slaves of sin&mdash;Rom. 7:14; 6:19.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>One day the prodigal son returned to his possession and his father&rsquo;s house; that was a jubilee, a liberation, and everything became pleasant and satisfying&mdash;Luke 15:20, 24; cf. Lev. 25:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To be saved is to return to our inheritance, to return to God, to come back to God and enjoy Him anew as our possession&mdash;Eph. 1:13-14.</li>
		<li>When we have God, we have everything; without God, we have nothing&mdash;<em>Hymns,</em> #1080.</li>
		<li>We must receive the Lord Jesus as the real jubilee in us; if we have Him, we have God as our possession and can be delivered from the bondage of sin and Satan to have real freedom and rest&mdash;Acts 26:18; Eph. 1:14; Col. 1:12; Matt. 11:28.</li>
		<li>Even though genuine Christians have God, many are like lights that do not shine because they do not &ldquo;turn on the switch&rdquo; by taking God as their portion&mdash;Eph. 4:18; cf. Phil. 2:9-16.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The living of the jubilee is a living in the enjoyment of Christ, a living of enjoying God as our inheritance and real freedom&mdash;Acts 26:18; John 8:36:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the jubilee all things are pleasant and satisfying to our heart, and we are free from anxiety, at ease, and exultant; hence, everything is to our satisfaction.</li>
	<li>The secret of a Christian&rsquo;s enjoyment of rest is his gaining God as his enjoyment; if we have God, everything is to our satisfaction:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Paul learned the secret of living in the jubilee, the secret of gaining Christ in any environment&mdash;Phil. 4:5-7, 11-13.</li>
		<li>Everything can be satisfying to us only after we have gained the all-inclusive Christ as our enjoyment; it is not outward persons, matters, or things but Christ within who enables us to be calm and free of worries as we face all kinds of situations&mdash;John 16:33.</li>
		<li>When we receive Christ as our Savior and life, He comes into us to be our jubilee, but unless we allow Him to live in us and unless we live by Him, we are not practically living in the jubilee&mdash;8:11-12.</li>
		<li>If our heart is set on any person, thing, or matter other than the Lord, this is idolatry, and the end is wretchedness&mdash;1 John 5:21; cf. Ezek. 14:3, 5; 6:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The only way to be released from the three kinds of labor in human life&mdash;the labor to be a good person, the labor of anxiety, and the labor of suffering&mdash;is to take Christ as our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest&mdash;Rom. 7:24&mdash;8:2; Phil. 4:5-7; 2 Cor. 12:9.</li>
	<li>The living of the jubilee is a life in which we take God instead of other things as our enjoyment and enjoy only God Himself in every situation; then He becomes the primary factor and center in us to lead us and overrule all the troubles of human life&mdash;John 6:16-21; Col. 1:17b, 18b.</li>
	<li>Our possession is God, and our freedom comes from our enjoyment of God; freedom means release, to be freed from all bondage, all heavy burden, all oppression, and all enslavement&mdash;cf. 1 Cor. 6:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Christ as the jubilee frees us from our poverty, captivity, blindness, and oppression&mdash;Eccl. 3:11; Phil. 3:8; 2 Pet. 2:22; Luke 12:21; Rev. 3:17.</li>
		<li>We can be released and have real freedom only by enjoying Christ as the life-giving Spirit, the law of the Spirit of life&mdash;Rom. 7:24; 8:2:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Only those who enjoy God do not practice sin and are really free&mdash;John 8:11-12, 24, 28, 31-36.</li>
			<li>If we do not enjoy God sufficiently, we will still be in bondage in many things; making up our mind will not work; we must learn to contact our living Lord to enjoy Him&mdash;cf. 4:24; 1 Cor. 1:9.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We need to be today&rsquo;s ministers and witnesses by living and proclaiming the gospel&mdash;Christ as the jubilee of grace&mdash;for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s eternal economy&mdash;Acts 26:16-19:

	<li>Our preaching of the gospel is our blowing of the trumpet of God&rsquo;s complete salvation to proclaim to the world, &ldquo;Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation,&rdquo; the year of jubilee&mdash;2 Cor. 6:2; Acts 26:16-19.</li>
	<li>The word <em>jubilee</em> in Leviticus 25:10 means &ldquo;a time of shouting,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a time of the trumpeting of the ram&rsquo;s horn&rdquo;; the trumpeting of the ram&rsquo;s horn signifies the preaching of the gospel as the proclaiming of liberty in the New Testament jubilee to all the sinners sold under sin that they may return to God and God&rsquo;s family, the household of God, and may rejoice with shouting in the New Testament enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation.</li>
	<li>Announcing the gospel to the poor, proclaiming release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, and sending away in release those who are oppressed are the freedoms and blessings of the jubilee&mdash;Luke 4:18-19:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>To announce the gospel to the poor is to preach the gospel to those who are without God, to those who are poor in heavenly, spiritual, and divine things; people who live in the world without God do not have hope&mdash;12:21; Rev. 3:17; Eph. 2:12.</li>
		<li>To proclaim release to the captives is to impart Christ as the Emancipator into those who are prisoners of war, as exiles and prisoners under Satan&rsquo;s bondage; we can be released and have real freedom only by enjoying Christ as the liberating life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18.</li>
		<li>To proclaim recovery of sight to the blind is to open the eyes of those who are fallen and turn them from darkness to light so that they may see the divine things in the spiritual realm; to see these things requires spiritual sight and divine light&mdash;Acts 26:18.</li>
		<li>To send away in release those who are oppressed is to bring those who are being oppressed under Satan in sickness or sin into the enjoyment of Christ as the release of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;Luke 13:11-13; John 8:34, 36.</li>

<li>The believers&rsquo; enjoyment and proclaiming of Christ as the jubilee of God&rsquo;s grace will issue in the full enjoyment of Christ as the jubilee in the millennium and in the fullest enjoyment of Christ in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth&mdash;Acts 3:20-21; Matt. 19:28; Rev. 21:1-2; 22:1-5.</li>
