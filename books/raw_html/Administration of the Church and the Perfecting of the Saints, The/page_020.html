        <h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p><em>Question: Even though the Bible uses different words to describe the work of the Holy Spirit, there are different schools of thought in Christianity concerning the work of the Spirit. What should our attitude be toward this?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Christians have always disputed concerning the work of the Holy Spirit. Some Christians speak of the power of the Holy Spirit, others speak of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and still others speak of the infilling of the Holy Spirit. However, the Bible speaks only of an all-inclusive Spirit. We must be careful not to get entangled by doctrine. We have been in doctrines for many years, and I have even written books on these matters. But today I would only say that the Holy Spirit is not just power; He is the all-inclusive Spirit. He is life, He is light, and He is all in all. The question is whether we apply Him and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>Concerning the Spirit, Christians often go to either of two extremes. The so-called fundamentalists are on one extreme; they do not pay much attention to the Holy Spirit. The so-called Pentecostals are on the other extreme; they pay attention to the Holy Spirit, but they are excessive in their practice. The proper way for us to experience the all-inclusive Spirit is to fellowship with Him, to be enlightened by Him, and to live in Him. If He leads us to do something, we should do it, but if He does not lead us to do something, we should not do it. He is our everything. When we need power to preach the gospel, He is our power, and when we need faith to pray, He is our faith.</p>
<p>We must be saved from fundamentalism, Pentecostalism, and terminology. Concerning the work of the Holy Spirit, the Bible speaks of the outpouring of the Spirit, the inward filling and the outward filling of the Spirit, the Spirit as power, and the indwelling of the Spirit. However, this Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit. It is sufficient for us to pray, exercise faith, and follow Him when He leads us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br />
TO LIVE OUT CHRIST</h2>
<p><em>Question: Should the brothers exhort and correct one another?</em></p>
<p>Answer: There is only one answer to this question. We should do what the Spirit leads us to do. If the Spirit does not lead us to correct others, we should not correct them; otherwise, we are meddling in their affairs. The young people are always interested in others&rsquo; affairs. However, those who are more experienced feel that they cannot manage even their own affairs, let alone others&rsquo; affairs. An experienced person would pray and follow the leading of the Spirit to supply others with life when he is concerned for them. Some might say that we should correct others and point out their mistakes, because the Bible tells us to exhort one another. However, before correcting others, we should first check whether we are right with God; otherwise, we are the ones who need correction.</p>
<p>The only question is whether we walk according to the spirit. As long as we walk according to the spirit, every problem will be resolved. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost is in Acts, yet Paul did not mention it when he completed the revelation of God. Even though in 1 Corinthians Paul mentions speaking in tongues, he does not encourage people to speak in tongues; instead, he exercises wisdom and love to correct those who abuse speaking in tongues. Hardly anyone in the Pentecostal movement does not abuse speaking in tongues. Therefore, Paul says, &ldquo;In the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue&rdquo; (14:19). Unless a person is biased, he probably would stop speaking in tongues after reading 1 Corinthians.</p>
<p>According to Paul, prophesying builds up the church (v. 4), but speaking in tongues does not. To prophesy is to minister the word, that is, to speak clear words with light, life, and the riches of Christ. The word <em>prophesy</em> is rendered as &ldquo;preach as a prophet&rdquo; in the Chinese Union Version. However, <em>prophesy</em> does not emphasize foretelling. To prophesy is to be an oracle of God in order to speak for God. This is the ministry of the word. What helps the church is not speaking in tongues but prophesying, speaking forth God.</p>
<p>We are not saying that preaching the gospel does not need power. The power of the gospel is not the power spoken of by the Pentecostal movement. In Chefoo, Shantung, there was a Pentecostal assembly hall next to our meeting hall. Those who met in the Pentecostal assembly hall knew and spoke of nothing but Pentecostalism, which to them was speaking in tongues and healing. One of their responsible brothers came to fellowship with me one day. I did not debate with him over doctrines but spoke the fact. I said, &ldquo;Brother, for years we have not talked about the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, power, or speaking in tongues, yet we baptized a hundred and twenty this month and will baptize more next month. There are no empty seats in our meetings, and our hall is not large enough for us. You always speak of power and speaking in tongues, but there are still less than a hundred meeting with you. Where is this power?&rdquo; He was speechless.</p>
<p>In 1965 I returned to Taiwan from the United States. At that time the Pentecostal movement was on the rise, and people were saying that there would be a great revival worldwide in 1966 and that this revival would begin from Taiwan. More than a decade has passed, but there has been no great revival in Taiwan, and those in the Pentecostal movement are scattered.</p>
<p>A group of people took Pentecostalism to Sitiawan, Malaysia, in 1963. They occupied the meeting hall of the church and put up their own sign outside the meeting hall. Only a few elderly brothers and sisters and some children were left in the church. Those in the Pentecostal movement thought that the church was finished, but those ones later became divided. The few elderly brothers and sisters and the children who were left in the local church built a new meeting hall, and there are now over a hundred people meeting. This is the power of God.</p>
<p>I would like to ask those in the Pentecostal movement where their power is and whether their speaking in tongues is real, because it should have been powerful and yielded results. A tree is known by its fruit. Many gospel giants did not speak in tongues, but they were full of power. Power is not a matter of terminology; power is the all-inclusive Spirit. If we draw from this Spirit and exercise faith, pray, fellowship with the Lord, and walk by the spirit, we will have power.</p>
<p>If someone asks about Pentecostalism, we can use the facts from history to prove to him that the Pentecostal movements are not long-lived and that Pentecostalism is a source of divisions among Christians. The Spirit is oneness, not division. However, those in Pentecostalism regard division as normal; they do not consider division to be a serious matter.</p>
<p>Our God is triune. He has passed through incarnation, human living, and death on the cross, and He has entered into resurrection and ascended to the heavens. He has done everything and is now ultimately manifested as the all-inclusive Spirit. He dwells in us and wants us to be clothed with Him. Paul says, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ&rdquo; (Gal. 3:27). Those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. Christ is power. The Spirit who descended at Pentecost was Christ; the Spirit we have received is not separate from Christ. Christ is the Spirit; He is life, power, light, authority, and exaltation; He is everything. We must be joined to the Spirit as one spirit in order to fellowship with Him and walk in Him. Whenever we have a need, we must apply Him by faith.</p>
<p>We cannot use only one book in the Bible to determine any truth; we must use the whole Bible. In Acts there is the record of speaking in tongues at Pentecost (2:4, 6, 8, 11), but not much is said concerning speaking in tongues in the Epistles. Paul mentions speaking in tongues in 1 Corinthians 12 and 14, but he does so to restrict and correct, not to encourage. Afterward, in Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians, in the heart of the Epistles, Paul does not mention speaking in tongues. At the end of the Bible, in Revelation, only the seven Spirits are mentioned; nothing is said concerning speaking in tongues.</p>
<p>In summary, the light that we have received reveals the Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit in order to be one spirit with us. Everything depends on our fellowshipping with Him and applying Him. The Bible says many things, but it can all be summarized in one sentence: &ldquo;Walk...according to the spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 8:4). Honoring one&rsquo;s parents, obeying one&rsquo;s husband, loving one&rsquo;s wife, and being humble should be according to the spirit. If we are not according to the spirit, our pride should be condemned, and our humility should be condemned; our hatred should be condemned, and our love should be condemned. Our love must be according to the spirit; it should come from the spirit. This is what God wants. The Spirit is Christ; hence, to be according to the spirit is to live out Christ. Only Christ is acceptable to God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
