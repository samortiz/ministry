   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO CATEGORIES OF GOD'S DOINGS FOR THE CALLED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR HIM TO EXIST Prior to chapter fifteen, Abraham had experienced God as the One who protected him and provided many material things 12:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abraham had given all the choices to Lot and had gained the victory over the four kings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>None of these things, however, had anything to do with the fulfillment of God's purpose but were only related to Abraham's existence 12:10; 14:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He experienced all these outwardly in his environment, not inwardly in his life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>FOR HIM TO FULFILL GOD'S PURPOSE Do you know what God's purpose is?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's purpose is to have a people to express Him with His image, represent Him with His dominion, and take the earth for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Beginning with Genesis 1:26, we see that God's eternal purpose is to have a people expressing Him in His image, representing Him with His dominion, and taking over the earth for His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God came in to call Abraham He promised Abraham that he would have the blessing to express God and become a great nation so that through him God might have His kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is God's eternal purpose today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But everything that had happened to Abraham prior to Genesis 15 had nothing to do with the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is from chapter fifteen through chapter twenty-four that we have a record showing us how God had worked something into Abraham so that he was able to fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was no longer merely outward experiences in environment but inward experiences in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most Christians today only care for their existence, not for God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even many among us still have not been deeply impressed with God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many are still hoping that the Lord will give them a better job, a good husband or wife, a good education, or an excellent promotion.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While all of these things may enable you to exist, they have nothing to do directly with the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything prior to chapter fifteen was good, helpful, and profitable for Abraham's existence, enabling him to live as a human being, but none of those things had anything to do directly with the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Look into Abraham's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Could the cattle that Abraham gained in Egypt express God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Could the maidservants represent God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although God had given Abraham a great deal, nothing that he had was useful for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To exist is one thing, and to fulfill God's purpose is another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The principle is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our education, jobs, and houses are all good for our existence, but none of them are good for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TWO THINGS NEEDED FOR THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD'S PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SEED Now we need to see the two things that were necessary for the fulfillment of God's purpose in Abraham's day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first item was the seed 15:1-6; see 13:16; 22:17-18; 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God called Abraham with the intention of fulfilling His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have seen, His purpose is to have a people in His image to express Himself and with His dominion to represent Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Abraham did not have a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How could Abraham fulfill God's purpose without having a seed?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God needs the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He needs to have a people through the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not what Abraham had Abraham was the same as we are, and we are the same as he was.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Abraham understood that he needed a seed, he counted on Eliezer 15:2-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Abraham seemed to say, "Now I realize that I must have a seed for God to have a people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since I am old and my wife is nearly out of function, the seed must be what I already have."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But God will never use for the fulfillment of His purpose the things that we already have.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whatever we have is altogether no good for this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not think that what you have is good for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What you have is just an Eliezer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nothing that you have is counted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nothing that we have is useful for the fulfilling of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At best, whatever we have is not of God but is something of Damascus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But what God promised to work out The seed that was needed for the fulfillment of God's purpose had to be what God promised to work out through Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It had to be something that God worked into him so that he might bring it forth 15:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What then is the seed?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you pray and read Genesis 15 and Galatians 3, you will see that the seed is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Nothing that we have could ever bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our education, attainments, skills, etc. mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All of these things are just Eliezers, things which are not what the Lord has wrought into us to bring forth Christ, the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>None of them are subjective but altogether objective in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Your Eliezer might be your college education.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps even in the church life you might still be trusting in this Eliezer, meaning that you still trust in your college education.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All of us have passed through some Damascus, picking up at least one Eliezer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That could never be the seed that God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The seed must be something that God works into us, not something that we have picked up.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Whatever we picked up from our Damascus can never bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only that which God works into our being can bring forth Christ as the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order to fulfill God's purpose we must have Christ wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is why Paul told us that Christ was revealed into him Gal 1:15-16 , that Christ lived in him Gal 2:20 , that Christ was formed in him Gal 4:19 , and that for him to live was Christ Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul lived Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When he was Saul of Tarsus, he passed through a Jewish Damascus, gaining many things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All that he acquired during that time was just an Eliezer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord told Paul that he had to forget all of those things they were dung, garbage, dog food and to cast them aside.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>None of the things that Paul had could bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only that which God worked into his being could bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord seemed to tell Paul, "The things that you had from your religious background can never bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only what I am working into you will bring forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What I am working into you is My grace."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Eventually, Paul could say, "By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me was not in vain, but I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me" 1 Cor 15:10 .</S>
