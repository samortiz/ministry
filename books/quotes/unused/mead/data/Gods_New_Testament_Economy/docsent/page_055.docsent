   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRACTICAL CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: Col 1:8, 4; 1 Thes 1:5-6; 4:3-8; 5:19; 2 Thes 2:13-14; 1 Tim 3:16; 4:1-3; Titus 3:5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Spirit revealed in the seven books of the Bible from Colossians through Philemon is the all-inclusive, compound, processed, life-giving, indwelling Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is difficult to arrive at a subject or a topic which can cover these seven books.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Colossians reveals to us the all-inclusive Christ as the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The theme of 1 and 2 Thessalonians is a holy life for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The subject of 1 Timothy is God s dispensation concerning the church, and the subject of 2 Timothy is the inoculation against the decline of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Titus we see the maintenance of the order of the church, and Philemon is an illustration of the believers equal status in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sum total subject of these seven books, however, is the Spirit of the practical Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the twenty-two books from Acts through Jude we see a full definition and explanation of a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This wonderful Person is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, becoming a man in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After going through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, this One became the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is defined and presented to us in Romans as the Spirit of life, in 1 Corinthians as the life-giving Spirit, in 2 Corinthians as the transforming Spirit, and in Galatians as the blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The main blessing of the gospel is the all-inclusive, processed, compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ephesians is a book on the Spirit of the Body, and Philippians is a book on the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we want to see the all-inclusive Spirit in Colossians through Philemon for the practical Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE SOURCE AND ELEMENT OF THE BELIEVERS LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit in Colossians is revealed as the source, the element, and the sphere of the believers love toward all the saints in Christ the Head 1:4, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to our natural understanding the matter of love is common, but according to the divine fact it is not common.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Colossians 1:4 refers to the love which the saints in Colosse had unto all the saints; verse 8 reveals that their love to all the saints was the love in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We would never imagine that in Colossians, which is a book on the all-inclusive Christ as the Head of the Body, the all-inclusive Spirit is defined and presented in such a common way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to our natural understanding it may be common, but actually it is very particular.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For us to experience Christ as the Head of the Body we must have a love that is toward all the saints.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When I was a young boy, the young people of China were infused with a hatred toward Japan since Japan invaded, damaged, and subdued our country.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>History also tells us that in Europe, Germany, Britain, and France were always fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can the redeemed peoples from these three countries love one another?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You must even ask yourself if you love everyone and feel happy about everyone in the church at your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In ourselves we can never have a love which is toward all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This love is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many secular historians have said that Christianity is a religion of love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Surely God s people should be a people of love, but of what kind of love?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Should we love others with our human and natural love?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need a love that will love all kinds of peoples from all kinds of cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our love is not this kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has to be the love in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit is the source, the element, the very essence and sphere of such a love.</S>

   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only love unites and only love makes all of us one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many would say that Christianity is a religion of universal love, but actually our human and natural love is not universal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is a love, however, that we Christians have in the Spirit which loves all the different members of the Lord s Body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We love all the brothers in the Lord from all cultures, from all races, and from all countries.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not possible by our natural love, but there is the love in the Spirit, who is a wonderful Person.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The New Testament is not a book of doctrine or a book teaching us universal love.</S>
