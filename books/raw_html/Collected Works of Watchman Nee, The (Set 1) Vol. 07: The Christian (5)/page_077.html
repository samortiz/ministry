<H1 CLASS=TITLE>TWELVE BASKETS FULL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>FRAGMENTS OF GEMS</H2><P>Sin yields sorrow; salvation yields peace and joy.</P><P>If you love the Lord Jesus, you should tell Him.</P><P>God says He will bless us when we obey Him.</P><P>To have fellowship with the Lord Jesus is far more important than to work for Him.</P><P>May every morning become your life's new beginning.</P><P>The Bible was given to us as a teacher for this present age. Have you read it?</P><P>For the continuous growth of life in Christ, you need ceaseless prayer.</P><P>God says, "I will keep thee." Faith answers, "Lord! I thank You because You surely will keep me."</P><P>If God puts the tears of His people in a bottle, how could He not listen to their prayers?</P><P>The mercy of God, the love of Christ, and the coming glory are all calling God's children to offer their lives.</P><P>To have a true walk with God just one time can cause your heart to marvel and worship more than a hundred years of walking on this earth by natural sight. Your duty is to be at rest in God's hand under whatever circumstances there may be.</P><P>God reveals Himself when we are in need (Exo. 15:22-26). When we consider ourselves to be strong, we rely on our own strength, resulting in spiritual weakness. When we know how useless we are and thus rely on His strength, we are strong.</P><P>Difficulties provide the atmosphere for miracles and are the initial step to miracles. If there is to be a great miracle, what is encountered must not only be something hard, but something absolutely impossible to overcome. Whether the Lord has spoken or not, we can fully trust in a Savior who is without worry or fear.</P><P>If God leads you to walk a way that you know, it will not benefit you as much as if He would lead you to take the way that you do not know. This forces you to have hundreds and thousands of conversations with Him, resulting in a journey that is an everlasting memorial between you and Him.</P><P>Your Leader will lead you to walk an untrodden way, to go down a path you never dreamed of. He is afraid of nothing, and He wishes you to be afraid of nothing also. He is with you. In desperate situations it is His joy to see His children grasping His hands.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SATISFIED WITH HIM</H2><P>Contentment is a virtue of the saint. The first step toward it is to offer up everything to God. Taking God as all gives one a heart of contentment.</P><P>Saints who entangle themselves with the world cannot help but crave for vainglory. Vainglory, like all other kinds of glories in the world, cannot satisfy man's heart. No matter how much fame a believer may gain, he will never be satisfied.</P><P>Blessed is he who knows that the Lord Jesus is our all! If we have never ascended with the Lord to see all the vanities under the sun, it will be hard for us not to set our mind on things of this earth. If we have not been enlightened by the Holy Spirit to see that what we have is forever and is real, we too will be greedy. Praise God, He is the treasure to those who believe in Him.</P>
