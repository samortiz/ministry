   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND PRESERVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In his final prayers David asked Jehovah for His deliverance and preservation 140:1-5; 141:9; 143:6, 9, 11; 144:7, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Quite often David suffered hardship and distress and needed God's saving and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, he prayed that Jehovah would deliver him and preserve him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be preserved by God is to be covered by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>WITH THE FOLLOWING PRECIOUS POINTS:</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These prayers of David contain a number of precious points, which we will now briefly consider.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Saying That Jehovah Is His God</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and the Strength of His Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In 140:6 and 7 David said to Jehovah, "You are my God; /...</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>O Jehovah Lord, strength of my salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This word is simple, but the taste is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Asking That His Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Be Set before Jehovah as Incense</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 141:2 David prayed, "Let my prayer be set before You as incense,/The lifting up of my hands as the evening offering."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word has a sense not only of sweetness but also of nearness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. Praying That Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Would Set a Watch before His Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth;/Keep the door of my lips" 141:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This prayer indicates that David could not of himself limit his talking and needed God to help him by guarding his lips.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This prayer is another indication that David was close to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that God answered David's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ever since my youth I have appreciated the word in 141:3.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Often when we come to the Lord we are too quick in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Can you stay with the Lord for five minutes without speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may find it difficult to be quiet when you are with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We make mistakes in our prayer because we are too fast in our talking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, like David, we need God to set a watch before our mouth and to keep the door of our lips.</S>
