 <h2 class="head2">D. According to the Commandments<br />
and Teachings of Men</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:22 says, &ldquo;According to the commandments and teachings of men.&rdquo; All ordinances and commandments related to asceticism are instituted and taught by men. They come from the human mind and are altogether of men. They have nothing to do with the church and nothing to do with Christ. Men think that they cannot eat this, and that they must not touch that, but these are all teachings and commandments of men, not of God.</p>
<p>Paul spoke a very serious word here. He showed us that these commandments and teachings are of man, not of God. They are man&rsquo;s concept of an ideal life. They are merely human concepts, consisting of nothing but idealistic ordinances that have nothing to do with God. It is strange that the world loves asceticism so much. Since all men need food, man thinks that those who deny it must be very noble: &ldquo;While everyone is under the influence of material things, this person seems to be free from everything. He does not even have any use for material things. How great he is!&rdquo; But we have to realize that asceticism is a natural religion; it is not Christianity, which comes from revelation. Natural religion involves the teachings and commandments of men. These teachings are wholly from men; they have no enlightenment or revelation. They are man&rsquo;s reaction to lusts. Man knows that lust is filthy, and his response to it is asceticism. Such teachings are of men; they are natural and not of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Perishing When Used</h2>
<p>What does Paul say concerning the effectiveness of asceticism? &ldquo;Regarding things which are all to perish when used.&rdquo; Asceticism is pleasant to the ear; it appears to be a wonderful philosophy. But all you have to do is try it. It is like a car which does not break down at home but breaks down every time it is on the road. It is also like a dress which looks good in the show window but tears in different places as soon as a person puts it on. You can try it out and see for yourself. No one can control his lusts with asceticism.</p>
<p>The more you try to suppress yourself, the more your suppression exposes the busy activities within you. The more a man tries to escape, the more his fear of unchecked cravings is confirmed. A man can be so fearful that he dares not say anything or talk about anything. I have met a few of these so-called venerated men. I can testify that even though they carefully avoid many things, their words betray their helplessness with their lust. They keep fleeing and hiding. The more they flee, the more their flight exposes their deep-seated apprehension. Many people flee to the wilderness or lock themselves up. They try to shun the world. The power of the world is too great for them, and they can only run to the mountains and hide themselves.</p>
<p>Yet the world follows them to the wilderness and to the mountains. As long as they have not overcome the world within, they can never escape it by outwardly running away from it. Paul used a very special phrase here: <em>Which are all to perish when used.</em> They have no way to free themselves from their lusts. As soon as their lust catches up with them, they fall prey to it. They set up numerous rules to restrain themselves from touching, eating, handling, and seeing many things. They want to flee, to separate themselves, to leave the things of the world behind, and to break the chain of their own lusts. Yet those things are still present with them. The more a person fears, the more his bondage to the things he fears is exposed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Giving Men a Reputation of Wisdom</h2>
<p>Paul says clearly in verse 23, &ldquo;Such things indeed have a reputation of wisdom.&rdquo; All ascetics and those who promote asceticism have a reputation of wisdom. They seek to have a name of wisdom in this world. Their arguments appear logical and wise, and people may be misled to think that these men are indeed men of wisdom.</p>
