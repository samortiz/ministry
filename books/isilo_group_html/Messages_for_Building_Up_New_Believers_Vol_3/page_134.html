<p>Sometimes there is the need for the testimony of two or three. When one brother comes to me, I may not see the light. That brother may invite one or two other brothers to come along, brothers who are clear before the Lord and who love the Lord wholeheartedly. They may be more weighty before the Lord and more mature in their service to the Lord. When these two or three are called into the situation, they may say, &ldquo;In our opinion, you are wrong.&rdquo; At such times, I should remember the word of the Lord: &ldquo;For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst&rdquo; (Matt. 18:20).</p>
<p>If these two or three are in one accord, the Lord will answer their prayer and do things for them. If they are in harmony in judging certain matters, the Lord will honor their judgment. If the Lord honors their judgment concerning certain matters, should we not honor it as well? If the Lord accepts their discernment, should we not accept it as well? If the Lord considers what they have done in one accord as right, can we say that it is wrong? We should yield to their judgment immediately. If the Lord agrees with their rebuke in one accord, can we afford to ignore it? Whatever they bind shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever they loose shall have been loosed in heaven. Should we not follow what has already been done in heaven?</p>
<p>Two or three can be the authority. Of course, these two or three cannot speak rashly. They must be men of authority before the Lord. They must fear the Lord and obey Him. If they tell you in one accord that you are wrong, even if you do not feel that you are wrong, you have to yield to their judgment. You have to say, &ldquo;I am wrong.&rdquo; You do not have to wait until the whole church comes to you and tells you that you are wrong. The ones who are keen will know what to do as soon as one person comes. The ones who are slower will know what to do when two persons come. Often you may not feel that you are wrong, but if two or three godly men see things the same way, you should humble yourself before the Lord. Do not be proud and do not say that you are always right.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Learning to Submit<br />
to the Authority of the Church</h2>
<p>If you still feel that you are right after two or three brothers speak to you, Matthew 18 says that these brothers should take the matter to the church and let the whole church consider the matter before the Lord. If the whole church decides before God that you are wrong, what will you do? You may say, &ldquo;Although the Body says I am wrong, the Head says that I am right. Though my parents forsake me, Jehovah will receive me. The brothers have rejected me, but the Lord will not reject me. I am bearing the cross.&rdquo; If you say this, it clearly shows that you are outside the church. You think that you are persecuted, martyred, and suffering under the hands of the brothers. But what you really have to do is learn to humble yourself and say, &ldquo;If the church says so, that is it. There is no other judgment. All the brothers and sisters say that I am wrong. I am wrong even if I am right.&rdquo; While we are on earth today, we must learn to subject ourselves to the authority of the church.</p>
<p>The church on earth bears God&rsquo;s authority. You must never be hardened and say, &ldquo;All the brothers say that I am wrong. But I insist that I am right.&rdquo; A proud person has no place in the church. Proud ones cannot be submissive. They do not know what the church is. When the whole church says that you are wrong, you must learn to be meek, humble, and submissive. You must acknowledge that you are wrong. Do not say that the church has no authority to do what it does. The church has the authority. God acknowledges the church&rsquo;s decision before Him. He also rejects what the church rejects. Do not be so obtuse as to say that you are right when all the brothers and sisters say that you are wrong. If the Lord allows them to pronounce in one accord that you are wrong, you are probably wrong.</p>
<p>Every child of God should learn to humble himself in the church. Sometimes one person can represent the church. Sometimes two or three can represent the church. You must learn to be meek and pliable before the Lord. Learn the lesson of submission. God&rsquo;s children should stand on the principle of submission. In the church we all must learn submission.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_133.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_135.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages for Building Up New Believers, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 134</div><br></body></html>
