If we love the Lord with our heart yet try to do many things, we spoil the environment for the divine law to work something out. The most precious heart is a heart that loves the Lord very much yet stops everything else. Here is a great lesson.<p>Are we able to absolutely stop ourselves while we love the Lord? The trouble is that when we do not love the Lord, we have nothing to do; we forget about everything. But when we love the Lord, our heart comes and everything else follows. The Lord is truly bothered by this &#8220;everything.&#8221; Because the Lord is bothered very much by our loving, we may even say that it is better not to love the Lord. The more we love the Lord, the more we bother Him. We may compare this to certain wives. The more they love their husband, the more their husband is bothered. Such a wife may say, &#8220;I love you, so please take this cup of milk,&#8221; but the husband may not want it. Many husbands are bothered very much by this kind of love. Some say, &#8220;I wish that my wife did not love me in this way. Then I would be released.&#8221;<p>Are we able to love the Lord, on the one hand, and be absolutely silent, on the other hand? If we are, we will have a good heart for the life within us to work out something wonderful. The divine life is within us with a working law to constantly regulate us, but we often bother this law. We either do not cooperate with it, or we cooperate, but many matters follow to spoil our cooperation. We need to love the Lord in a calm, silent way, saying, &#8220;Lord, here I am. I love You, but I stop from all kinds of doing.&#8221; If we do this, we will be absolutely changed through the divine law of the divine life. The divine law will bring forth all the riches of the divine life by its working and regulating.<p>We are often too complicated. We may say, &#8220;I am clear that I am dead to the law. I am dead to Moses, and I have nothing to do with him. I forget about trying to do good.&#8221; However, whenever we have a sincere heart toward the Lord, right away we go back to Moses. Whenever we love the Lord by saying, &#8220;O Lord, I love You, so help me to be humble,&#8221; we immediately return to Moses. We are often unable to be silent. We simply cannot stop ourselves to give the divine law within us the opportunity to regulate us.<p>I recommend that you learn one lesson: Love the Lord, and stop. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, I love You, but Lord, I stop.&#8221; We do not stop loving, but we stop doing. The more we love the Lord, and the more we stop ourselves from every kind of doing, the more wonderful it is. Then we realize that there is a mighty working within us, which is the mighty regulating of the divine law. It is not easy not to commit any sins, but it is even more difficult not to do any good. Do not try to be proud, and do not try to be humble. Do not try to hate others, and do not try to love others. Do not try to do evil, and do not try to do good. It is easy to not try to do evil, but it is difficult to not try to do good. We often cannot stop.<p>Thirty years ago, the first time I went to Shanghai, I met a brother there. He loved the Lord very much, and no one could compare with him in this matter. In one sense, he loved the Lord too much. Whenever he came to the meeting, he would always pray because he loved the Lord. At the beginning he prayed, in the process of the meeting he prayed, and at the end he prayed. He had to pray because he loved the Lord. He could not stop from praying. To speak the truth, however, the Lord Himself was bothered by this, and all the brothers and sisters were bothered. Whenever he opened his mouth to pray, others would pray quietly for the Lord to stop him. Several times the responsible brothers made the decision to beg him not to pray anymore. They had a nice talk with him, saying, &#8220;Brother, we do appreciate that you love the Lord so much, and we do appreciate that your heart is right. However, you have to take care of the others. We beg you not to pray so much in the meeting.&#8221; The brother agreed to this, but the next time we came together, there was a short time of silence after a hymn, so he stood up to pray, &#8220;Lord, since no one will open his mouth, I have to pray.&#8221; After the meeting, the responsible brothers again asked him not to do this, and he again agreed, but in the next meeting he prayed, &#8220;Lord, even though the responsible brothers told me not to, I still have to pray.&#8221; The more this brother loved the Lord, the more the whole meeting was bothered by him. No one could help him, and no one could stop him. He simply did not know how to stop himself from doing good, and he did not know how to give the inner life with the divine law the opportunity to bring forth something divine by its regulation. He occupied, utilized, and even usurped all the opportunities.<p>We need to forget about all the other laws. We need to learn, on the one hand, to love the Lord, and on the other hand, to stop from any kind of doing, trying, and working. If we learn this lesson, we will experience a mighty working and regulating of the divine law. If we quiet ourselves, like a seed which lies quietly under the earth, the divine law will work out all the riches of the divine life. If we cooperate with the divine law of life in this way, this divine law will constantly expand from our spirit into our mind, emotion, will, and every part of our inward being. Then the inward parts of our entire being will be absolutely occupied by this divine life, which is the Lord Himself, through the mighty working of the divine law.<p>This is very simple, but we still may not understand the divine way to have the divine law work within us. I say again, we must forget about all the other laws, simply love the Lord, and stop ourselves from every kind of trying and working. Then the divine law of the divine life will have the full opportunity to regulate, to work, within us to the extent that all the riches and contents of the divine life will be brought forth. If we try this, we will have rest. We will see how wonderful the life we have is and how wonderful the working of the divine law within us is. I recommend to you this simple secret. Realize that you have such a divine law, forget about all the other laws, and simply love the Lord. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, I love You, so I stop myself from every kind of doing and trying.&#8221; Then we will give the opportunity to the divine law within us to work and regulate in us all the time.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
