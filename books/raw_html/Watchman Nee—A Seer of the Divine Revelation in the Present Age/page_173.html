<P>The following are two more letters written by Brother Nee and me to another sister concerning the disposal of material possessions.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>March 15, 1950</P><P>Dear Sister I-Tien:</P><P>Peace in the Lord!</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>We have read the letter regarding the handing over of your possessions. How we thank the Lord that He has touched you regarding this matter and given you the enabling grace to meet His demands.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>We notice that you are the wife of a brother, and we are reminded of the record in Acts 5 in which the intimate relationship between husband and wife regarding consecration is revealed. Although that couple in the Bible failed, it shows even more how important it is to overcome. It is further revealed there that while the husband may be defeated, the wife alone may be victorious.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In the light of this, we hope that you will be able to help your husband overcome with you.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Very often when a husband is wavering regarding his consecration, if he has a wife who is fixed in her consecration, he can be saved through her influence. We trust that you will be faithful either together with your husband or alone by yourself.</P><P>Your brothers,</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>Witness Lee</P><P></P><P>March 15, 1950</P><P>Dear Sister I-Tien:</P><P>Peace in the Lord!</P><P>Concerning the valuables which you have given, please manage them as follows:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>1)Deliver the sewing machine to the brothers who are working together.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>2)Regarding the surplus money you have each month, please give it to the elders of the church in Hong Kong, requesting them to keep half for the church in Hong Kong and to distribute the other half to Hangchow, Chungking, K'un-ming, and Foochow for the Lord's work.</P><P>We feel this settlement is in accordance with the Lord's will. May the Lord be with you and bless your future.</P><P>Your brothers,</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>Witness Lee</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>P.S.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>1)The letter which we have written is to point out where your responsibility lies. But you still may follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and either put the money into the offering box or send it to other work units. We do not wish that our specific indication would nullify the leading of the Holy Spirit.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>2)When you deliver the money to the elders according to our designation, please mark "Wife" on the wrapper so that the elders will know what to do.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P>
