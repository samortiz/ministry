   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TRANSFUSION AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 3:18 Paul says, But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit lit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. In order to behold the Lord and be transformed, we need an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There should not be a veil between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Experientially speaking, a veil refers to some kind of insulation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No matter how close we may be to the Lord, if we are insulated by a veil, He cannot infuse Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Insulation is a term often used with respect to electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To insulate something is to cover it so that it cannot receive an electrical charge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even a thin piece of paper can be an insulator.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>An electrical appliance may be in working order, and electricity may be installed in the room, but electrical power cannot be transfused into the appliance if there is insulation blocking a direct connection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This illustrates what takes place in the lives of many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Believers may think that if they love the Lord, are close to the Lord, and walk with the Lord, then everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may not realize, however, that they are still under certain veils, and that these veils insulate them from the Lord s transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Paul s word, we need to behold the Lord with an unveiled face.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There should not be any veils between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are unveiled we shall be a mirror beholding and reflecting the glorious image of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we behold Him in a direct way without any veil, without any insulation, we experience His transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are infused with the divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eating the Lord has much to do with being transfused with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, to eat the Lord Jesus is to allow Him to get into us by the way of transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is clearly revealed in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the New Testament, our relationship with the Lord is altogether a matter of spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because it is a spiritual thing, human language cannot describe it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, Paul uses metaphors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1 Corinthians 3 the words feeding, milk, drinking, and solid food are metaphors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus also used metaphors and parables in His teaching, for example, when He said, I am the bread of life John 6:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord went on to say that the bread which He gives is His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Jews contended with one another, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat? v. 52 . To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us and allow Him to add Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eating is not once for all; it must be repeated day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been eating various foodstuffs for years, but we still need to eat today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Each time we take food into us, transfusion occurs within us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By eating and by transfusion Christ is added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eating is related to transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When food is eaten, digested, and assimilated, a new substance is added into our being to replace and discharge the old substance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the metabolic process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The significance of eating is that a new substance is added into us to discharge the old substance in order to produce a metabolic transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This crucial matter is very much neglected by Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose a person s face is very pale.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is a great difference between applying makeup to change the color of his complexion and having his complexion changed as a result of proper nourishment and metabolism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>To apply makeup is to do the work of a mortician.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A mortician adds makeup to the face of a dead person because there cannot be any metabolic change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our Christian life, we should not try to color ourselves with spiritual makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, we should eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul s work was not the work of a mortician.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He did not apply makeup to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, he fed them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He knew that if they would eat and drink properly, they would be transformed and have a healthy spiritual complexion.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul s work was very different from that of many Christian workers today.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whereas many carry on the work of morticians, Paul fed the saints with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Likewise, the church should not be a place where people buy cosmetics; on the contrary, it must be the Lord s restaurant where His people can eat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The more we eat of Christ, the more we shall be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Transformation will make us glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It will cause us to bear the Lord s image, His appearance, His glorious expression.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The transfusion of the Lord into us can also be illustrated by the transmission of electricity into a child s toy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Certain toys move, jump, and even dance when they are powered by electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can be compared to such an electrically powered toy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When Christ is transfused into us, we begin to move.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We may even feel as if we could jump or soar in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our Christian life is a life of transfusion; it is a life of continually having the Lord infuse Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Transformation and transfusion make us living materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As living materials, we are growing and changing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I can observe a change, a transformation, in the lives of many saints, especially in the lives of those whom I have not seen for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Praise the Lord that we are being transformed!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are becoming gold, silver, and precious stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The church is not an organization or society; the church is an organic entity the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Only transformed persons can be constituted into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Because the Body of Christ is organic, the more we grow and are transformed, the more we are built up as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This building of an organic Body is what the Lord is seeking today.</S>
