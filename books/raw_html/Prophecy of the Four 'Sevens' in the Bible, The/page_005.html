<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Close Transgression</H2><P>These seventy weeks were apportioned to close transgression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Make an End of Sins</H2><P>They were also apportioned to make an end of sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Make Propitiation for Iniquity</H2><P>Furthermore, they were apportioned to make propitiation for iniquity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. To Bring in the Righteousness of the Ages</H2><P>The seventy weeks were apportioned to bring in the righteousness of the ages (2 Pet. 3:13). Transgression will be closed, sins will be ended, and iniquity will be propitiated. The righteousness of the ages will also be brought in. This is the righteousness of eternity, or the eternal righteousness, which will be in the millennium as well as in the new heaven and new earth. In the millennium Christ will be the righteous One (Jer. 23:5), and He will rule the thousand-year kingdom in righteousness (Isa. 11:5-6). In 2 Peter 3:13, Peter says, "We are expecting new heavens and a new earth, in which righteousness dwells." Today there is injustice everywhere. But there will be an age, which will be the age of the ages, the age of the new heavens and new earth, in which righteousness dwells.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. To Seal Up Vision and Prophet</H2><P>After the seventy weeks are completed, the vision and prophet will be sealed up. Today we need the vision and the prophet, but when the seventy weeks are fulfilled, we will not need them anymore.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. And to Anoint the Most Holy Place<br>(the Holy of Holies)</H2><P>The seventy weeks were also apportioned out to anoint the most holy place, the Holy of Holies (Dan. 9:24). Before the seventy weeks are over, the temple will be rebuilt. Later, Antichrist will devastate and contaminate the temple. He will cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, setting up his image in the temple as an idol to defile the holy temple of God (Matt. 24:15; Rev. 13:14-15; 2 Thes. 2:4). After the final three and a half years of this age, Antichrist will be completely destroyed, and the temple will be cleansed and cleared up. Then the most holy place, the Holy of Holies, will be anointed. When the Holy of Holies is anointed, the service of offering sacrifices and the oblation will be recovered.</P><P>The three and a half years of the great tribulation are referred to as forty-two months (Rev. 11:2), or twelve hundred sixty days (12:6). But Daniel 12:11 and 12 say, "And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days. Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days." In these verses twelve hundred ninety days and thirteen hundred thirty-five days are mentioned. The ones who wait until the thirteen hundred thirty-fifth day will be blessed.</P><P>At the end of the twelve hundred sixty days, Antichrist will be fully destroyed by Christ. Then thirty more days are needed to clear up the contaminated, devastated, and defiled temple. Therefore, at the end of twelve hundred ninety days, the temple will be cleared up. But still there will be no sacrifices or offerings. This service will need setting up. This will take another forty-five days, which makes thirteen hundred thirty-five days. Once this service is set up, all the people will be blessed in the offering of the sacrifices and oblations to God. For the children of Israel to be blessed is to enjoy the offerings. That blessing will be taken away by the Antichrist. From the time that Antichrist causes the offerings to cease to the day the Israelites enjoy the offerings again will be thirteen hundred thirty-five days.</P>
