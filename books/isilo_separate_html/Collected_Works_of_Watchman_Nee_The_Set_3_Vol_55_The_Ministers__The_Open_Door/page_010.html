The fruits which I have gained, however, are pitifully few, and the Lord is really dissatisfied. Whenever I consider how I have failed in my responsibility, I have no peace in my heart. Yes, if I could thoroughly drop the "earth," the Lord could bring the "heavens" out through me. I have wanted to write you many times, but I was afraid in my heart. However, by His grace I must report the situation of this locality and of myself for His sake and for the sake of His church.</p><p>Thank the Lord that His will is never wrong. God sent me here to give me more opportunities to learn my lessons. Although I am not faithful enough, God still gives me the grace to be willing to treasure my time here. I cannot forget your word that these few years will determine my usefulness before God for the rest of my life. I feel more and more that I do not have enough time to do what I should do. If I do not have enough exercise before Him, I am afraid He will not increase His commission to me.</p><p>Sometimes I am very afraid because most of the people I contact are a generation older than I. Most of them are my superiors. They are also more educated. I am afraid to open my mouth to exhort them from a human point of view. I can only have the boldness to visit them when I rely on the Lord because there is no one else to do this work.</p><p>When I first arrived, I really wanted to meet some Christians. During the first week, I often went to the chapels in this place to talk to the leaders and to attend their meetings. I was hasty and did the most foolish thing: I "dug into the garbage can" by pointing out errors and unscriptural points to them. (May the Lord's blood cover me, and may He give me grace that I would not do the same again.) Since the Lord wanted me to do the work of recovery, not the work of correction, I did not go to their meetings much after that. I did not even attend any Lord's Day meetings for several months, preferring to remain alone in my dwelling reading God's Word.</p><p>God gradually showed me that I must have a new start in the way of "recovery." There must be a meeting in Siying with a pure standing. The few young brothers that I knew, however, did not know much about the church. Therefore, with much caution I suggested that we meet together. They were very happy. Since then we have had two meetings every week. At first I only knew a few brothers, and other people did not know about the meetings. Those who attended the meetings also thought that these were just home meetings. However, my goal was not limited to this. Although there were not many people in the meetings, I knew that this was truly a meeting with a pure standing in Zhan-Jiang. I looked to the Lord to increase the number of those coming to the meetings and to allow all His children in Siying to have the opportunity to attend such meetings. Unfortunately, some of the brothers who had a seeking heart moved to other localities because they had problems making a living. There were only two or three people left. At the same time, I was afraid that others would misunderstand me. I had to be patient and move slowly. I did not dare to carelessly invite any brother or sister that I knew to the meetings, lest people say that I was another denomination.</p><p>Moreover, I ran into difficulties with the meeting place. Several times I could not find a place, so we had to meet outdoors. (I preferred doing that rather than borrowing a chapel.) Because our meeting place was not fixed, I did not dare invite brothers and sisters that I had just met. Recently, we have begun meeting in my office building, taking the opportunity when my colleagues are out walking after dinner.</p><p>Thank the Lord, my surveying work in the countryside will be temporarily finished in August, and I will visit the brothers and sisters in this place after office hours. I have met more than twenty Christians. The difficulties I have encountered here were not found in Shanghai. When I was in Shanghai, I was not afraid when I met people because I could invite them to the meetings of the church, or I could ask older brothers and sisters to talk to them. It is not so convenient in Zhan-Jiang. Everything must be done by two or three twenty-year-old brothers who have just joined the work. Furthermore, there are no church meetings to bring others to, so the only way is to talk to them individually. If I can only have two families migrating to Zhan-Jiang, one to Siying and one to Chekan, the needs will be covered adequately. (The city of Zhan-Jiang is divided into the two districts of Siying and Chekan that are about twenty kilometers apart. It is a twenty-minute bus ride between the two, but because the people here are poor, not many can afford to take the bus.) If two families would come, many difficulties could be solved. We could meet in the brothers' houses and have a meeting to remember the Lord on the Lord's Day.</p><p>The city of Zhan-Jiang is in a very important location. It is in the southern part of Kwangtung province. As the most important town east of Kwangsi, Zhan-Jiang is the gateway to that province. In recent years public safety has improved, and the new railroad is finished. (According to the head of our department, it will be connected to the railroads in Kwangsi in one year at the latest. Then the rails will run all the way to Kuei-yang and Hengyang.) After the port is opened, the population could easily increase to more than one million. It has the possibility to become more important than Hong Kong or Canton. At present, Siying is a business center. There are offices for railway engineering, city government, customs, and salt works, as well as elementary and secondary schools, hospitals, and courts. My own engineering office has about four hundred employees (including more than one hundred engineers). Many hard-working Western missionaries live in Zhan-Jiang. One lived here for more than twenty years and died here. His daughter has continued her father's work and remains here. However, no other worker has come from among us!</p><p>In addition to the Cantonese, there are some people here from other provinces. Most of the employees in my office were transferred here from the Bao-Tien Railway (in the region of Bao-Ji and Lun-Si). Although more than half are Cantonese, they are able to understand Mandarin quite well. My purpose in mentioning this fact is that brothers and sisters from other provinces should not turn away because of a language barrier.</p><p>Zhan-Jiang has only two public hospitals, and there is a pitiful shortage of doctors. One hospital has only one doctor, who also serves as the director of the hospital. In addition to these hospitals, there are six or seven private Western doctors in Siying. There are five or six secondary schools. There are the Customs Office, the Office of Shipping Ministry, the post office, banks, and the Salt Ministry Office. The brothers and sisters in Shanghai who are employed in these positions could request to be transferred, or they could come here to look for work. I deeply believe that sooner or later some brothers and sisters from among us must migrate here. If they come sooner, it would be more helpful to the expansion of the Lord's work.</p><p>In my reading of the Bible, I found that the four Gospels have a few places that are different in the order of the events. Why is this? Sometimes one chapter speaks of several seemingly unrelated things, and it is difficult to remember them. What is the best way to read and remember the Bible?</p><p>I really hope that the Lord would give me the opportunity to learn to serve Him by following you. There are no older brothers and sisters to teach me here apart from God Himself. If I make a mistake, there is no one to correct me. I often feel that this is a suffering. I will tell you about the rest later.</p><p>Yu Pao-sheng<br />October 8, 1947</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
