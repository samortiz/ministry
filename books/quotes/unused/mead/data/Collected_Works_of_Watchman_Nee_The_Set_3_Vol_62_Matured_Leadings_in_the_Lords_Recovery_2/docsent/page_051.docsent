   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT BEING THE ORGAN TO KNOW GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The organ or faculty by which we know God's will is the spirit; it is by the sense of the spirit that we know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only the spirit knows God and contacts God; the mind cannot know God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we only exercise our mind, we cannot touch or feel the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is like a blind man who does not respond to color at all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Only our spiritual organ can touch the Spirit and feel Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is as useless to apply the mind to God's things as it is for a blind man to try to identify color with his ears.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 2:11-12 says that no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can know the things of God because God gave us a new spirit when we were saved Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>36:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This spirit enables us to feel and touch His Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He also gave us His Holy Spirit, who reveals to us the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When the Holy Spirit is in us, He puts feelings within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He prompts us to be quick, slow, move, or stop.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By exercising our spiritual sense, we know how to act and move.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is like a horse with a bridle in its mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The rider only needs to hold the reins to direct the move of the horse.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As soon as he pulls the reins a little, the horse knows whether to turn, to move forward, to slow down, or to speed up.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The horse only needs to know a few kinds of tugs to move according to its rider's directions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The rider only needs to urge or pull back a little and the horse will be under his full control.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, the Holy Spirit gives us feelings within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as we speak too much, He disciplines us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once we deviate, He rebukes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A brother once said that before he was saved, he was the star of every banquet, but he could no longer act the same way after he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he spoke one word too many at a banquet, he would lose his joy when he returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Formerly, the more others listened to him, the happier he felt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now the more others listen to him, the worse he feels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose you feel that you should preach the gospel to a certain person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Holy Spirit has prompted you and directed you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has given you this feeling in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you act according to His leading, you will have joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Walking in the Holy Spirit means following the inward move of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A horse does not need to consider what it should do.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It only needs to follow the instructions of the rider on its back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It only needs to learn a few feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It can act boldly according to these feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we know the various feelings of the Holy Spirit in our spirit, we can walk according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BEING EXERCISED IN SPIRITUAL FEELINGS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every saved person has feelings in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But these feelings must be exercised before a person can become experienced in them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A man who is born blind has very sensitive fingers and ears.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the church in Shanghai, a few blind brothers lived next door to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As soon as we mentioned any one of them by name, they would come over and ask what we were talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But once a blind man's eyes are opened and he sees the colorful world around him, he will adjust the feelings of his other faculties to accomodate the feeling of his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He cannot replace his visual sense with the senses of his other faculties any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Similarly, after we are saved, the feeling of the spirit is recovered, and we must learn to not substitute the spirit's feeling with the senses of the other faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A blind man cannot appreciate the beauty of a gold-edged Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you ask him to touch the Bible, he cannot feel the gold edge.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The hand cannot replace the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the same way, the mind cannot replace the spirit to feel the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a blind man's eyes are opened today, he may still depend on his touch to "feel" objects.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although he has acquired a new seeing organ, he is not used to it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Similarly, although many Christians have received a new faculty a spiritual sense after regeneration, they cannot understand spiritual things because they are still inexperienced in their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It would be a joke for a blind man's eyes to be opened and he still not exercise his seeing faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When he is blind, he can only touch the Bible with his hands; he can only feel its shape.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But once he sees, he only needs to exercise his eyes to see the shape and form.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Before a person is saved, he can resort to the methods of the blind, guessing God's will with his mind and reasons Acts 17:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But once he is saved, he has a new spirit, and he should no longer resort to the methods he employed before he had this new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He should no longer guess at the will of the Holy Spirit with his mind and intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To do so would be like setting aside the faculty of the eyes and touching the Bible with the hand to see if it is red.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not use our spirit, we will not be able to discern many spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Holy Spirit directs us by "remote control" through our new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Without the spirit, we cannot receive the signal the Holy Spirit is sending us, and we cannot move in God's direction.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>John 3:6 says that once a man is regenerated, he receives a new spirit from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>John 4:24 continues by saying that God is Spirit, and that we have to worship Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In addition to our new spirit, there is another Spirit the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Holy Spirit who is in God is today also dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the Spirit in God moves, the Holy Spirit within us also moves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Such a move becomes a prompting in our spirit, gives our spirit a consciousness, and directs it to move.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By this we learn to communicate with God through the feeling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Suppose a man is born blind, but at the age of thirty his eyes are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In a manner of speaking, his other senses have reached the age of thirty already.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But his seeing faculty is younger than that of a child in kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the same way, a saved and regenerated person may be fifty years old physically, but his spiritual age may only be one or two days old.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If a man has been regenerated for fifty years, his spirit has been exercised all this time, and he has been following the feeling of the Holy Spirit, his spiritual faculty may be fifty years old as well.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A man with good eyes can stretch his view as far as twenty miles, but his hands can at most extend two to three feet.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If he does not exercise his eyes, preferring instead to only use his hands, his sphere of perception will not extend very far.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hebrews 5:12 says that according to the amount of time some believers have spent in their learning, they should be teachers, but they are still babies.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This tells us that our spiritual senses have to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Our spiritual consciousness has to be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The church in Hong Kong is short in the exercise of spiritual senses.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many brothers and sisters are very inexperienced with their spiritual senses.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Personally, the foundation of our Christian faith is built upon our spiritual senses.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If a Christian constantly exercises his mind, intellect, reasoning, and memory, and does not exercise his spirit, he will remain an outsider as far as spiritual things are concerned.</S>
