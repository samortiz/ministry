   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH AS AN ORGANISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The church is built up with Christ as life, which produces an organism rather than an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The church as an organism preaches the gospel that people may be regenerated 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our way of preaching the gospel is different from the organizational way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way of the denominations is to invite people to come to their meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The new way is to go to people s homes with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We visit them with Christ as grace, life, forgiveness of sins, and salvation and with all the truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The building up of the church as an organism includes ministering Christ as the life-giving Spirit through the word of the Scriptures that the believers may be transformed Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The teaching concerning transformation is an item that is unique to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I began to speak on this matter in the United States in 1963.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Corinthians 3:18 tells us that we need to be transformed into the Lord s image, and Romans 12:2 says that we need to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Transformation is clearly mentioned in the Bible and is a crucial point in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some are even opposed to the truth of Christ as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if this item is taken away from the Lord s recovery, we have no ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must keep Christ as the life-giving Spirit since this reality is the basis of the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church as an organism is built up by meetings in mutuality according to the biblical way 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Mutuality will bring us out of the church as an organization and into the church as an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church meeting should be an exhibition of Christ in all His riches and a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants with one another before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church not only renders spiritual help to people in their salvation and edification but also develops the organic functions of the believers as the living members of the Body of Christ through the growth in life by the dispensing of the divine life to them 2 Pet 1:3-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Dispensing is a particular expression in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Joseph s ministry in Egypt was to dispense the food to all the starving people Gen 41:56-57 , and Paul s ministry in the New Testament dispenses the riches of Christ to all the believers Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The goal and issue of the divine dispensing is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God to be our life that we may live Him and have one living with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church ministers life to the living members of the Body of Christ, helping them to grow in the divine life into Christ, the Head, in all things that the Body of Christ may be built up by itself through the functions of its members Eph 4:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church as an organism also fully emphasizes the building up of the church as the Body of Christ through the development of the organic functions of its living members, who receive the supply of life mainly through the church meetings 1 Cor 14:5, 12 .</S>
