   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ of God, ascended high!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Heart and soul we bow before Thee,</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here the hymn says "Christ of God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are familiar with the term "Son of God," but we seldom say "the Christ of God."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Christ of God means the One anointed by God and sent by Him to accomplish His work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the original language, the word for Christ is Christos, and the word for Christians is Christianos, which indicates that Christians are those who belong to Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to wait until that day before we can fully prove the value of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people think that it is good enough for God to give us heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, heaven is not the best thing that a person can have.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a man is satisfied with heaven only, he is limiting God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is in reality limiting God's love to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some people say that they will be satisfied with just a small corner in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such people are limiting God's love to a small corner.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, our God is not stingy.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God does not mind giving us a little more than we need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God were to exercise restriction, it would be a terrible thing for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Miss M. E. Barber once wrote a hymn that says:</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is always something over,</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we taste our gracious Lord;</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every cup He fills o'erfloweth,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rich supply He doth afford.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ever issued from His store;</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To His own He gives full measure,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Running over, evermore,</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Well water can never be compared to living water.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 4 says that "the well is deep" and that there is "no bucket" v. 11 . Under such circumstances, man continues to be thirsty.</S>
