   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to see the revelation of the Body of Christ, it is helpful to consider our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My body is not a lifeless organization but a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I speak, my entire body participates in my speaking in a living and organic way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Body of Christ is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An organism is something of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there is no life, there is no organism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ's Body is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we need to consider the life with which the Body of Christ is constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to Genesis 1 and 2, in the whole universe created by God there are lives on four levels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Firstly, there is the plant life, the lowest level of life 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The next level of life is the animal life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>20-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then Genesis shows us the third level of life, which is the human life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a life that is not God's life, but a life that can be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the created people, we did not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God did not put His life into man when He created him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But God did create us with a life that resembles Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is similar to a photo of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It does not have the person's life, but it does bear his image.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a sense, the photo of a person is that person, but in an actual sense, it is not that person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to realize that in Genesis 1 God created man in His image as a photo of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Genesis also shows us a life higher than the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the fourth level of life, the highest level of life, the life of the tree of life 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This life is the life of God, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, Genesis 1 and 2 reveal the plant life, the animal life, the human life, and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Body of Christ is altogether organic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a matter of life, but of what life?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Surely the Body of Christ is not of the plant life or of the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then is it of the human life or of the divine life?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the life of the Body of Christ is a mingled life, a life that is a mingling of God's life and man's life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The model of such a mingled life can be seen in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The four Gospels are four biographies of one person Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The four Gospels show us a person who is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was God but He was also a little child in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How could God in the heavens, who is so majestic, great, marvelous, and glorious come to be in a manger?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Who was that little child lying in a manger by the name of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was a God-child.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He had bones, flesh, and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was a real boy, but He was also God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When He grew up to be thirty years of age, He came out to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When people saw the things He did, they wondered who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some said, "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>And are not His sisters here with us?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Mark 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who was this One?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This One was not merely a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This Word, who was God, became flesh v. 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Four thousand years after Adam was created and about two thousand years ago, God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to God's reckoning, this was just two days ago since to Him a thousand years is as one day 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, we can say that He became flesh the day before yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The very God in eternity became a lowly man in time!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is the complete God plus the perfect man by the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus means Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Who is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is Jehovah the Savior; the very infinite God in eternity became our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In order for Him to become the Savior of us sinners, He needed to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He needed a human body and blood to shed for our sins.</S>
