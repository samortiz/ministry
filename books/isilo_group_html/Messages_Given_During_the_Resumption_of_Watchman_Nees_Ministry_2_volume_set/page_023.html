The Anointing Bringing with It a Feeling</H2><P>A few times I found myself arguing with rickshaw drivers. When I argued, the Lord was gone. There is a difference between what we know and what we feel. You may know that a certain medicine is bitter, but it is only after you put the medicine into your mouth that you feel its bitterness. When God anoints us, this anointing comes with a feeling. If I touch Brother Weigh's forehead, surely he will feel something. Whenever we ignore our feeling, we are cut off from the fellowship. This is very real, and it is very simple. It all depends on whether or not you are willing and whether or not you want to have this experience.</P><P>All other kinds of teachings are dispensable, but this matter is indispensable. There is no teaching that can cause something to happen: No matter how proper, neat, clean, and blameless you are as a person, as long as you are living outside of the Lord, you are not worth anything in God's eyes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Walking according to the Sense of Peace</H2><P>It is true that every genuine Christian has the anointing in him. The Lord is not stingy, but neither is He sloppy. He means business with us. Some sisters may want to buy some bargain fabrics. There is nothing wrong with this, yet the Lord may not want them to do it. For the price to be cheap is one thing. For someone to buy the items is another thing. In the end, when the sisters go ahead and make the purchase, they lose their peace and are unable to pray for a few days. Only when others buy those fabrics from them are they able to gain back their peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Depth of Our Experience Depending<br>on the Degree of Our Obeying the Inner Feelings</H2><P>I have been a Christian for twenty-two and a half years. During the first ten or more years, I did not know anything about this way. During the last few years, the Lord has granted me mercy to discover this way. The more you go along with your inner feelings, the more your spirit will be enlightened, and the more demands you will experience. These demands will become more and more severe, and you will be more and more restricted by the Lord. Up to a certain point, you will lose the freedom to speak, act, laugh, or cry. You will be restricted in everything. The more we reason, the more the Lord is gone. Only by accepting all adverse conditions willingly and giving up all reasonings will the Lord have a way. The anointing teaches us in everything. This anointing is true and is not a lie. The question is whether or not we are willing to obey.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br>THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT AND<br>THE FEELING OF THE CONSCIENCE</H2><P>Brother Ho asked: How can we tell the difference between the feeling of the spirit and the feeling of the conscience? Can our conscience be wrong sometimes, since Satan disguises himself as an angel of light at times? (2 Cor. 11:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Taking Care of the Inner Feeling<br>in Everything</H2><P>Brother Lee answered: The initial work of the Holy Spirit is to recover the function of the conscience and to point out man's mistakes. After the function of the conscience is recovered, the Holy Spirit can go on to recover man's spirit. Once man's spirit is recovered, surely it will have feelings. A person has to take care of the inner feelings. If he does not have peace about something, he should stop doing it. Only when he is at peace should he proceed with anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. No Need for Too Much Analyzing&#151;<br>Rather, Exercising Much and<br>Walking in Peace in a Faithful Way</H2><P>In the Gospels, after a person is saved, many times the Lord says, "Go in peace" (Mark 5:34; Luke 7:50). Romans 8:6 says that "the mind set on the spirit is life and peace." After the Ethiopian eunuch was baptized, he went on his way rejoicing (Acts 8:32-39). In taking this way, there is no need to analyze too much. In the course of our experience, spontaneously we will be able to differentiate between the conscience, the spirit, and the flesh. We will develop a feeling for all these things. Sometimes we may make mistakes, but we should not be discouraged. If we are wrong, we can exercise more until we become right. This is like practicing riding a bicycle or practicing penmanship. This way is surely the right way, and as long as our hearts are clean, as long as we are faithful, and as long as we have a heart for God, our feelings will become more and more sensitive.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 23</div><br></body></html>
