   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Lord answers and says that she is none other than the once-filthy sinner, who was seen by grace, called by grace, and saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Her mother is God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The grace of God does not refer just to God's forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His forbearance is only a small part of His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's grace also includes His plan and selection before the foundation of the world and His Son's redemption and the work of the Holy Spirit in time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All these are God's grace according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When God's grace seeks and finds a chosen sinner, it puts him under the shadow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There he is fed with life, and there he is brought forth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When he wakes up, he finds himself in the love of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The "apple" tree is the same bergamot orange in 2:3; it refers to Christ, who is full of affection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who is this maiden?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>She is none other than a sinner saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank God that when she first opened her eyes to behold the world, the first thing she saw was the affectionate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first fact she discovered was that she was under the shadow of such an affectionate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was her origin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How fitting it is for her to remember this at the time of her spiritual maturity!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 6 says, "Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When she recalls her original condition, she cannot help but be filled with humility.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>She cannot help but consider her emptiness, the vanity of her experience, the undependability of her mind, and the futility of her pursuit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Her only hope is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>She realizes that whether she can endure to the end does not depend on her own endurance, but on the Lord's preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No spiritual perfection can sustain a person until the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything depends on God and His preserving power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When she realizes this, she cannot help but exclaim, "Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The heart is the place of love, while the arm is the place of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Set me as permanently as a seal upon Your heart, and as indelibly as a seal upon Your arm.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as the priests bore the Israelites upon their breasts and their shoulders, remember me constantly in Your heart and sustain me with Your arm.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I know that I am weak and empty, and I am conscious of my powerlessness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, I am a helpless person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If I try to preserve myself until Your coming, it will only bring shame to Your name and loss to myself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All my hopes are in Your love and power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I loved You before.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I know the undependability of that love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now I look only to the love You have toward me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I held You once, and it seemed to be a powerful grip.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But now I realize that even my strongest grip is just weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My trust is not in my holding power, but in Your holding power.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I dare not speak of my love to You any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I dare not speak of my grasping of You any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>From this point on, everything depends on Your strength and Your love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Your love is as strong as death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Who can shake death?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No sighing of parents, no tears of wives, and no sorrow of friends can bring back a man from death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Death holds its captives and keeps them firmly, unrelentingly, and unshakably in its hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If You love me, I will not be shaken, because Your love cannot possibly be weaker than death.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"If You love me, Your jealousy will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Your jealousy will be as cruel as Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You will surely rebuke and surely seek for perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will not allow anything to share my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if You owned a major part of me, You would not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your eyes cannot stand to see those who are Yours being defiled by the world or usurped by other loves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are jealous; from the beginning of time You have been a jealous God Exo 20:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Have not Your apostles told us about the jealousy of God 2 Cor 11:2 ?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If You are jealous, who can withstand Your jealousy?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What can withstand Your jealousy?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You will destroy all Your enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You will remove all hindrances until You become the unique Lord, the God of all, and the unchallenged King.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way, I will be protected, and my chastity will be preserved until I see Your face."</S>
