<p>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You have gathered us together around You as the all-inclusive compound Spirit. Lord, give us the revelation and give us the utterance, the new utterance, the up-to-date utterance, to speak forth You, the wonderful One. Give us a heart inclining to You. Lord, we love You. We love You particularly as the Spirit. Pour out the Spirit upon us. Lead us and anoint each one of us. Amen.<p>We have covered one Bible, one God, and one Christ. Now we want to see one Spirit—one application.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT BEING THE THIRD OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2><p>The first point concerning the Spirit is that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Third of the Divine Trinity (Gen. 1:2; Rom. 8:9; 1 Cor. 2:11; Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). He is self-existing, ever-existing, and coinhering with the Father and the Son in eternity. He is, with the Father and the Son, the only God (Acts 5:3-4). Acts 5 tells us He is God, but He is not another God other than the Triune God. He is of the Triune God, with the Father and the Son.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT BEING NOT YET BEFORE THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2><p>He was the Spirit of God from eternity and the Holy Spirit at the time of Christ’s incarnation (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20), but He was not “the Spirit” before the resurrection of Christ (John 7:39).<h2 class=head1>THE COMPOUND SPIRIT</h2><p>In Christ’s resurrection He was compounded with Christ’s divinity, humanity, death with its effectiveness, and resurrection with its power to be the life-giving Spirit, the divine anointing ointment as the compound Spirit (Exo. 30:22-31; 1 Cor. 15:45). All genuine Christians admit that in Christ there is humanity, because He became a man and partook of the flesh and blood of man (Heb. 2:14). But some may wonder how we can say that the Spirit of God has humanity. Chapter five of Andrew Murray’s masterpiece, The Spirit of Christ, is entitled “The Spirit of the Glorified Jesus.” The glorified Jesus is Jesus after His resurrection in His glory. In this chapter Andrew Murray strongly pointed out and insisted that today the Spirit of the glorified Jesus has the element of humanity just as the glorified Jesus does. The glorified Jesus has divinity, humanity, death, and resurrection. Surely the Spirit of this Jesus has the same elements as the glorified Jesus. The striking point of Andrew Murray’s theology is that the Spirit of Jesus has humanity.<p>Based upon this revelation, I began to understand the type of the anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. In Exodus this ointment was used to anoint all the furniture and people related to God’s service. Some of the Brethren pointed out that the anointing ointment was a type of the Spirit, but no one pointed out that this is the compound Spirit. An ointment is a compound. The ointment in Exodus 30 is compounded with olive oil as the base and four kinds of spices. Olive oil in the Old Testament is a type of God’s Spirit. In Exodus 30 the olive oil, typifying God’s Spirit, was compounded with four more elements. These elements typify Christ’s death with its effectiveness and His resurrection with its power which are in the life-giving Spirit.<p>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam, who was Christ in the flesh, became a life-giving Spirit. Some who oppose this truth have said that this life-giving Spirit does not refer to the Holy Spirit. But besides the Holy Spirit, there is not another Spirit who gives life. The Spirit who gives life (2 Cor. 3:6), the life-giving Spirit, is the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head1>GOD’S ESSENCE AND GOD’S REACHING OF MAN</h2><p>The Spirit is also God’s essence (John 4:24) and God’s reaching of man (Matt. 28:19). Christ is the element of the Triune God, and the Spirit is the essence. He is God’s reaching of man because He is the last one of the three, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. John 4:24 says that if we are going to worship God, we must worship Him as the Spirit by our spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE REALIZATION OF THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST AND THE REALITY OF CHRIST’S RESURRECTION</h2><p>The Spirit is the realization of the pneumatic Christ (John 14:16-20) and the reality of the resurrection of Christ. The pneumatic Christ is the Christ who is the Spirit. Resurrection is a Person—the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>WHAT THE SPIRIT BECAME</h2><p>Thus, the Spirit became the consummated Spirit of the processed and consummated Triune God, even the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. He also became the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). The Lord is Christ and the Spirit is the pneuma. Thus, the pneumatic Christ is the Lord Spirit. He is now the Spirit of Jesus (Acts 16:7), the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), and the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19). The Spirit of Jesus refers to Jesus in incarnation and human living. The Spirit of Christ refers to Christ in resurrection. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30.
