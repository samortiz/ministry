   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE OUR HUMAN SPIRIT 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7; Zech 12:1; Job 12:10; Num 16:22; 27:16; Rev 22:6; Prov 20:27; Rom 1:9; Luke 1:46-47; Acts 17:16; 1 Cor 5:3-4; 16:18; 2 Cor 2:13; 7:13; 12:18; 7:1; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; Phil 1:27; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17; Rom 8:4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this book we will cover one very important thing our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we need to see that the spiritual life, the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life, is just God Himself in Christ as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The divine life is the divine Spirit, the life-giving Spirit, who has come into us as our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If He did not come into us, He could not be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Anything outside of you can never be your life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For anything to be your life, that very thing must be able to get inside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This spiritual life, which is God Himself, has come into us, but into what part of us?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For instance, you take in food, but you don't take it into the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You don't take food into the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You take food into the mouth and through the mouth the food gets into your stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The stomach is the proper place for you to store and contain food.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In like manner, God as life has come into us into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But our human spirit, so strategic to the divine life, has been missed by most Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE INNER LIFE IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was a young Christian, I listened to a good number of Christian teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I never heard one word from them saying that we have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This matter is so prevailingly mentioned in the Scriptures, yet most Christians have missed it and are still missing it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord desires to recover the inner life with the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The inner life is basic for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are not so adequate, so prevailing, in the inner life, it is hard for us to have a proper church life, because the church life is a composition of the inner life in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to know the inner life, yet the inner life is a matter absolutely in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we go to school, we study by using the proper organ our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we come to the church to contact God, to worship God, by using another organ our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever you mention the word "spirit" to most Christians, they immediately consider the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They seldom consider that we have a human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we do have a human spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Besides God's Holy Spirit, there is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We come to the church to serve God, to contact God, to deal with God by using our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you go to the playground to have some physical exercise, you have to use your physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you go to school to study, you have to use your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when you come to the church to contact God, you have to use your human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE BREATH OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Genesis 2:7 shows us clearly how God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God created man with two kinds of materials.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One was the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The other was the breath of life out of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God used the dust of the ground as material to form a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Two kinds of materials, the dust to form a body and the breath of life getting into this body, resulted in a living soul, a living man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What was formed with the dust was the body, and man as a living soul is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then the breath of life, after getting into the body, is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I want to impress you as deeply as possible with this phrase "the breath of life."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Proverbs 20:27 says the spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word used most of the time for the spirit is ruach.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This word in Hebrew means spirit, breath, air, or wind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the word for spirit here in Proverbs 20:27 is not the Hebrew word ruach, but neshamah the same word used in Genesis 2:7 for "breath."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Old Testament there is at least one verse proving that the breath of life mentioned in Genesis 2:7 is the very spirit of man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Moffat translation, in Proverbs 20:27, renders the word spirit as conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It says the conscience of man is the lamp of the Lord because the conscience is the main part of the human spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rom 9:1; 8:16 .</S>
