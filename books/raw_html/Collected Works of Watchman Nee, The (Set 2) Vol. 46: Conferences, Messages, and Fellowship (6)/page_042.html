<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS</h2><p>The Lord also died so that we might die. As the last Adam, the representative of the whole Adamic creation, He gathered every son of Adam into Himself, and in His death He brought the whole race to an end as far as God was concerned.</p><p>Note the order in Romans 6. We know and then we are able to reckon. With some there is an undue emphasis on "reckon" in verse 11, suggesting that we must reckon in order to produce the death which we must have, and that it all begins with us. But the Lord included us in His death. He has done something, and we are included in His crucifixion. The order is: "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him...reckon yourselves to be dead." We do not reckon in order to be dead. When we see that we are dead, we are in the position to witness to it by baptism. What is the most common thing to do with a dead body? Bury it! (Some use burial as a means to die. We should never be baptized unless we have seen we have died. Our burial is our answer to the death on the cross; everything is based on this. Unless we see this as a basis, everything we do will be in the nature of works.) Baptism is not a testimony of our faith in Christ for our salvation, but a revelation of our union with Him in death and resurrection. God included us in the death of His Son so that we could be identified with Him "in Christ." "Of Him you are in Christ Jesus" (1 Cor. 1:30). God put us into Christ just as I might put a piece of paper into a book. Our old man has been crucified. We can look in vain for any reference to future crucifixion. Now it is a matter of faith. The secret of reckoning is the revelation of what the Lord has already done. It is not reckoning toward death, but reckoning from the fact of death. The way to reckon is to be in Christ Jesus.</p><p>The two remedial aspects of the Lord's death&mdash;removing our sins before God and removing ourselves from us&mdash;deal with everything that came in with Adam. Through these two aspects, man is brought back to Adam's state before the fall.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FLESH</h2><p>In Genesis we have Adam, Eve, and the rib (2:18-19, 21-24). In Ephesians we have Christ, the church, and the water (5:23, 25-27, 29-32). In John we have water, blood, and the side (19:34).</p><p>God wants more than a remedy for what came in with Adam, He wants to have a race into whom He can impart His own life. For them to have His very life and to be one with Him in life is the only thing that will satisfy Him. It is the only thing that will defeat any possible uprising of the enemy.</p><p>Ephesians 5 is the only chapter which tries to explain Genesis 2, and in Ephesians we also have something rather peculiar. We have been taught that we are sinners and need salvation, but God wants more than just a remedy for what came in with Adam. He wants a people who possess His own life. We have thought that saved sinners are the church, but saved sinners as such are not the church, because they bring in something negative from the past. The church is the Body of Christ: "The church which is His Body." Sin is not mentioned in connection with it. Christ has to have a Body which can express His life. In Ephesians we have one aspect of His death which is quite different from other places in the Scripture. The "love" that is spoken of in Ephesians 5 is the love of a husband for a wife, not the love of Christ for sinners. It is the church which is in view and not sinners. Paul uses Genesis 2 to illustrate the point. If our eyes are opened to this we will certainly worship. In the Old Testament we have many types of the death of the Lord, but in Ephesians 5 Paul used only the one in Genesis 2. This is the one type which has nothing to do with sin because it was before sin came in. Adam was not put to sleep because someone had done something wrong; he was put to sleep in order that something might be taken out of him and be made into someone. The creation of Eve was in view when a rib was taken out of him. This aspect of the Lord's death has nothing to do with atonement or remedy. This aspect is for the purpose of creating the church for the bringing in of the Body for the expression of His own life. Eve is a type of the church. Adam was put to sleep. This aspect of the death of the Lord relates to sleep. Christians sleep; we do not die. Whenever death is mentioned, sin is in the background. Adam's sleep refers to a death with no sin in it. It came before Genesis 3, before the introduction of sin.</p><p>Eve was taken out of Adam. She was not a separate creation. Eve is a type of the church taken out of the body of the last Adam to be His bride. Putting it another way, God is seeking to turn His only begotten Son into the Firstborn among many brothers. He is seeking to turn a grain of wheat into many grains. God's heart's desire is to have many sons.</p><p>John 19:34 speaks of a pierced side and of blood and water. The blood speaks of the atoning death of Christ, and the water speaks of the life released by the non-propitiating aspect of His death. It came from His side, His heart. God's purpose is that we should all share His life.</p><p>The blood came in to blot out sins, whereas the cross came in to blot out us. Furthermore, we were not created to be redeemed. Redemption was only necessary to bring us back to the eternal purpose of God, which is sonship&mdash;the sharing of God's life. The Lord Jesus brought us back to God's purpose by His death, and in His death He released His life. In accepting the Lord Jesus, we receive something which Adam never had! For Adam never had the life of God as represented by the tree of life.</p>
