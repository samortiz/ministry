   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE KNOWING THE SPIRITUAL ASPECT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH 1 THE CHURCH BEING IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have seen the types and the plan concerning the church, we will have a clear understanding of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In its spiritual aspect the church is an entity in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Doctrinally, we know this, but experientially, we may not have arrived at this stage.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church has two natures; it is the mingling of God with man and man with God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other words, the church is the joining of God to man and man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This joining takes place in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord was incarnated to bring God into man, but this was only half of the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the Lord was resurrected, He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This completed the journey.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, resurrection involved incarnation, but incarnation did not involve resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Incarnation was not the whole process.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Resurrection completed the process.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In principle, when God is joined to us, it is incarnation, but when we are joined to God, it is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Resurrection is to bring man into God, that is, for man to be mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It includes both God being joined to man and man being joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church can exist only in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church is produced by the joining of God with man and man with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should not consider that what took place at Bethlehem was merely the Lord being born to be among men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to see that the intrinsic significance of what took place at Bethlehem is that God was brought into man and mingled Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The importance of what took place at Bethlehem is not merely a birth but that God was mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In general, Christians consider that what took place at Bethlehem was simply a birth, but we should see that it was a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The significance of the birth is relatively minor, but the significance of the mingling is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Similarly, we should not consider the meaning of resurrection to be merely that Jesus was raised from the dead; rather, we need to see that resurrection was a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The mingling that took place at Bethlehem and the mingling that took place in resurrection produced the church, a divine-human entity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is an entity in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is not merely a doctrine but an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Experience of Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Experientially, what is resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anything that is of resurrection has passed through death, and anything that has not passed through death is not of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, not everything that dies is resurrected, but everything that is of resurrection has passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, anything that is of resurrection is not the first but the second 1 Cor 15:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we speak of the experience of resurrection, we need to ask ourselves whether our working and doing are of the first or of the second?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Are they what we possessed originally, or have they passed through rejection?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do they have their original appearance, or have they been under pressure?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have they always been highly esteemed, or have they been put aside?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have they always existed, or have they passed through death?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Likewise, when we examine ourselves in this way, we will begin to see how many things in us are natural and how many things in us are of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anything that is spiritual and of resurrection does not stir up much feeling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In contrast, anything that is natural causes us to argue with others and stirs up much feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, anything that is natural can easily stir up our feelings and cause us to argue with others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we do not have any feeling, we spontaneously will not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A bench never argues, because it does not have any feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In some local churches there are good brothers who serve together, but they often have arguments and different opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows that they have not passed through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whoever is in resurrection does not argue or have opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn to deny ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Not only should we deny our natural capabilities, but we should also deny our so-called spiritual views and spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we deny ourselves constantly, we will genuinely experience resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not think that if we deny our spiritual gifts and spiritual views, they will all be terminated and finished.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn that resurrection follows denial.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Anything that is terminated after being denied is not of resurrection; that is, anything that cannot be raised up after being put to death is not of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, resurrection fears neither death nor rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If our gift and insight are spiritual, we will not be afraid of rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more we reject them, the more they will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the natural realm we obtain things by striving for them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In resurrection we obtain things by rejecting them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some people think that if they do not speak and exercise their spiritual gift, they will lose the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, this concept is not according to resurrection but of the natural realm.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In resurrection to die is to live, and to reject is to gain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should give all the opportunities to others and put ourselves in the place of being nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this way, many things of resurrection will be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is not a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is altogether a matter of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In resurrection there is no feeling, and even if we have some feeling, we have to put it to death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A person who is in resurrection does not fight, because he knows that his gain comes from his loss, that is, he gains by losing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He gains life through death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, anything that is put aside and put to death will multiply at least thirtyfold, if not one hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Previously, we have said that we need to be strict and diligent in doing things, but now it seems that we are saying that we should not strive in doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In fact, these are two sides of one matter.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although there are two sides, the two sides do not contradict one another.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In order to be strict, we need to pass through death.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In order to endeavor the most, we need to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In order to be the most diligent, we need to halt.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To stop and to halt are different from being loose.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many times we cannot stop ourselves, but God s hand stops us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When God s hand puts us to death, we may think that we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Actually, it is at this moment that we enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Being loose is not equal to being terminated or put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A loose person can never enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Only a person who is strict with himself every day can enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A loose person can never achieve anything.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Only one who is serious and diligent before the Lord can be brought by God s hand to the point where he expresses resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we experience living in resurrection, the church will be realized among us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>To be the church is not a matter of being meek, loving one another, or being humble.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is true that meekness, love, and humility can be found in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The saints surely love one another and are humble and meek toward one another.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, we should not consider that having these conditions is equivalent to having the church.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The church is something in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Only when a person is in resurrection is he a church-man.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Human love is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>People may love each other today and fight against each other tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Likewise, human meekness is natural.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>People may be meek today and argue with one another tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If a person has not passed through death, he will still have feelings that do not pertain to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>For a person to feel that he loves people and is meek indicates that his feelings are not related to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They simply reflect his own naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The church is in resurrection; hence, whoever is in resurrection does not hold to his own feelings or argue with others.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>A person in resurrection may be very meek, but he has no feeling that he is meek.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He may love people very much, but he has no feeling that he loves others.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He may be very humble, but he has no feeling that he is humble.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This is the proper condition of a genuine church.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Throughout the churches we have observed many brothers who are good but who cannot work with others.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>They coordinate together, but often there are problems.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Although this is common, it is definitely not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is a serious problem for the brothers to not be in resurrection but to remain in their natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>As a result of remaining in their natural being, they have opinions about others and are not able to be one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>There are too many instances of brothers being in their natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We all need to see the fact that the church is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Anything that is originally ours is of the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>It is of the first man, and it is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Anything that was there originally is in the natural man; it is not the mingling of God with man or the mingling of man with God.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The basic principle in resurrection is the power of God s life operating in man, working in man, and bringing man into God so that all the fullness of God can be expressed through man.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This expression is the joining of God to man and man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In the church as the Body of Christ a man s goodness and strong points have no place.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>In fact, every strong point and everything belonging to the goodness of man s natural being are problems to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>For example, some are very diligent, but their diligence is inborn and natural.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Hence, although the church may have benefited from their diligence yesterday, this benefit may eventually become a great problem to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>In order for our diligence to be useful to the church, we must allow our natural diligence to be put to death by condemning it, rejecting it, and putting it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Some may ask, If we put aside our diligence, will we not become slothful?</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If we become slothful once our diligence has been put aside, this shows that we certainly have no element of resurrection within us.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If resurrection is in us, the more we put to death our diligence, the stronger and more multiplied it will become.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>In other words, once our natural diligence is put to death, a diligence in resurrection will be produced and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Only diligence in resurrection is profitable to the church and belongs to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The fact that the church is in resurrection is not merely a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>May we be enlightened to see this.</S>
