<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH BEING OUR LIVING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:5; 1 Tim. 3:15</h1>
<p>In the previous two chapters we saw that the corporate aspect of the experience of God as life is for the building up of the church. In this chapter we will have practical fellowship concerning the church as our living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING OUR HOUSEHOLD</h2>
<p>As believers, we must be clear that the church is God&rsquo;s home and also our household and dwelling place (1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 2:19, 22). Every proper person is born into a family. Not only so, as soon as a person is born, he is a member of a household. Children who are born without a dwelling place are very pitiful. Hence, it is not enough for a person to have parents; he must also have a dwelling place. This applies not only to the physical realm but also to the spiritual realm. When we were regenerated, we were born of God&rsquo;s household and in God&rsquo;s dwelling place. As soon as we were born spiritually, the church became our household and dwelling place.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that among today&rsquo;s Christians, many were not saved into the practical church life. They are like babies who are born outside of a household and are without a dwelling place. Many Christians find the church as their dwelling place only after a period of time; however, some remain homeless to the end. This is pitiful.</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, I was like a child born by the wayside of a road, and I grew up in a dilapidated house. After a long time I gradually discovered that I was without a proper dwelling place. I could not find my spiritual home. I went to many Christian meetings and seriously observed the situation. After careful observation, I felt that none of them could be my dwelling place. Eventually, God raised up a meeting, and I felt that it was where I belonged. All my inward needs were satisfied there. That was when I found my spiritual home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYTHING IN THE CHURCH<br />
BEING CHRIST</h2>
<p>Perhaps someone would ask why the many groups in Christianity are not our home. Let me use an example. My surname is Lee, and my genealogy and bloodline belong to the Lee family. Thus, I belong to the Lee family. I cannot say that the Chang family is my family. Similarly, as regenerated believers, we belong to Christ, and our genealogy is Christ. Thus, we cannot find our home with a group that does not belong to Christ or does not proceed from His genealogy. A genuine church must belong to Christ; it allows Him to live in it. In God&rsquo;s house the clothes we wear are Christ, the water we drink is Christ, and the food we eat is also Christ. Everything in the church is Christ.</p>
<p>Apart from Christ, there cannot be anything else in the church. If in any aspect of the church Christ is replaced with something else, whether it be in genealogy, ground, truth, or life, we will no longer be the church. The genealogy of the church is Christ, the ground of the church is Christ, the content of the church is Christ, and the appearance of the church is also Christ; everything related to the church is Christ. The life supply in the church as our home is also Christ. This is a matter of our eating and drinking. Our living is also Christ. This is a matter of our expression. Hence, everything in the church is Christ. Suppose a group of Christians calls itself the church, but its genealogy, ground, life supply, and living are not Christ. We should question whether it is the church. If a church is genuine, everything should be Christ.</p>
<p>Hence, we should rejoice because we were born in the church. Here the genealogy, ground, and supply are Christ, and being the church requires that our living be Christ. The church gives us Christ, and we should express Christ in our living. Everything must be Christ. We were born of this place, and we live in this place. We are blessed because we have a home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE AND<br />
THE CHURCH BEING OUR LIVING</h2>
<p>The church is a great topic. Ephesians 5:32 says, &ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo; The great mystery in the universe is Christ and the church. Christ and the church are our vision and our light. Our vision is not heaven and hell, forgiveness of sins, receiving salvation, or being delivered from eternal perdition. Our vision is Christ and the church. Hence, Christ and the church are the only goal of our labor and work, which begins with leading people to salvation with the gospel and includes edifying and perfecting the saints. Christ is our life, and the church is our living. Christ is in us to be our life, and His living out from us as our living is the church. In other words, Christ is our life within and our living without. When He is expressed through us outwardly, He becomes our living, and this is the church.</p>
<p>We have given many messages concerning letting Christ be our life and letting Him live in us; our unique desire is to let Christ live out from us. When Christ is lived out from us, we are the church. When He is expressed in our living, He and the church are one. Hence, Christ is our life, and the church is our living. The two are the great mystery. Every believer has the divine life. Although we are many, we have the same life&mdash;Christ. As believers, we also have a living, which is the expression of the divine life within us. It may seem as though we each have our own living. However, since we share the same life, we also share the same living (Rom. 12:5). This living is the church, which is the corporate Christ, that is, the corporate expression of the lived-out Christ.</p>
<p>In the book of Acts the living of the early believers was altogether corporate, not individualistic. Peter did not have a living, John another living, and James yet another living. They had the same living. Not only did they share the same divine life, but they also shared the same living, which is the church. Within they had Christ, and without they had the church. Within they had Christ living, and without they lived in the church. The Christ whom they lived out was their corporate living. Such a corporate living is the church. Just as Christ was their common life inwardly, so also the church was their common living outwardly.</p>
