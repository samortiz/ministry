   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN OUR HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first part of verse 17 says, That Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul the mind, the emotion, and the will plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These are the inward parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through regeneration, Christ came into our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Subsequently, we should allow Him to spread Himself into every part of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our heart is the totality of all our inward parts and the center of our inward being; therefore, when Christ makes His home in our heart, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 17 Paul says that it is through faith that Christ makes His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Faith is the substantiating of things unseen Heb 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ s indwelling is mysterious and abstract.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We realize it not by our physical senses, but by the sense of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first three chapters of Ephesians are on the church, and the last three chapters are on the walk worthy of God s calling for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, actually only the first two chapters are on the church, for chapter three marks the beginning of Paul s exhortation concerning a walk worthy of God s calling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Ephesians 3 Paul presents himself as a pattern of one who could carry out God s eternal purpose concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we had only chapters one and two without chapter three, we would have the teaching and even the vision regarding the church, but we would not have the way to fulfill the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter three we see how the church is constituted and realized in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This chapter is concerned neither with the revelation of the church nor, strictly speaking, with the walk worthy of God s calling for the church; rather, it is concerned with the practical experience of the church being constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church life is constituted of those in the pattern of the Apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need to follow Paul in receiving the revelation in our spirit and in being strengthened into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Paul bowed his knees to the Father, he was so strong in his inner man that nothing could shake him or disturb him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because his whole being was in his spirit, nothing outward could trouble him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We also need to be strengthened to such an extent that nothing will be able to carry us away from our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, we need Christ to make His home in our hearts so that we may be wholly occupied and possessed by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we are strengthened into our inner man and Christ makes His home in our hearts, we are able to see the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to receive the same revelation given to the leading apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul could not receive this revelation for us; we must receive it ourselves personally and subjectively by being strengthened into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This revelation concerning Christ and the church is the economy of God, the hidden mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether or not we are today s apostles and prophets depends on whether or not we have seen the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not have the revelation, then we cannot be apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If I had come to this country without this revelation, all my speaking would have been in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But I did come with a revelation, and I have spoken according to this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This made me a follower of the apostles and prophets in God s New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today all the saints, including the young people, can be such followers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we were saved, Christ came into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now we must give Him the opportunity to spread Himself throughout all the parts of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we are strengthened into the inner man, the door is opened for Christ to spread in us, to spread from our spirit to every part of our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more Christ spreads within us, the more He settles down in us and makes His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that He occupies every part of our inner being, possessing all these parts and saturating them with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, not only do we receive the revelation, but we also are filled with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then wherever we may go, we shall be the apostles, the sent ones, and the prophets, those who speak for Christ.</S>
