   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. TO BRING THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY ON ITS TRACK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although I have been speaking on the God-ordained way for seven and a half years, the "train" of the God-ordained way is still not on the track.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to bring the God-ordained way on its track, we need to be those who take the definite steps of the practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, practicing each step one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Not by Promoting</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is not by promoting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, we should not promote anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Not by the Church's Arranging</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is also not by the church's arranging.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church's arranging kills rather than enlivens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, I advise the elders not to arrange anything.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church's arranging may seem to be a benefit, but it will not work for the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. Not by Big Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is also not by big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The elders should not call a meeting to give a lecture or a message to the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>D. But by Individuals with Small Groupings</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is by individuals with small groupings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders should take the lead and set up a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They should be the head sheep in the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the few head sheep take a certain way, all the flock follows.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Likewise, when the head sheep stop, all the flock stops.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the practicing of the God-ordained way, there is a need to have the head sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>TO BEGIN BY PRACTICING ONE STEP ONLY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way to bring the God-ordained way on its track is to begin by practicing one step only.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not able to take more than one step at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot take the four steps all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, we should limit ourselves to just one step.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. To Dive into It</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way to practice one step of the God-ordained way is to dive into it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. To Find Out and Learn the Secrets</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In practicing any step of the God-ordained way, we need to find out and learn the secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Two people may drive the same car, but each has his own secrets concerning his driving.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone who drives a car has his own secrets in handling the car.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The secrets can be found only by more practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people enjoy driving; to them, driving is like a hobby.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, if they encounter difficulties in their driving, they are not bothered or troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nothing related to their driving is a problem to them, because they have learned the secrets of driving.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the practicing of the steps of the God-ordained way, we need to find out and learn the secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. Not Caring for Problems, Hardships,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>and Frustrations</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In our practicing and learning of the God-ordained way, we should not care for problems, hardships, and frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would begin to practice one step of the God-ordained way, after a short time we may encounter a number of problems.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, if we care for these problems, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In doing anything we should not care for problems.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If there is a will, there is a way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this is our attitude, we will succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more we care for problems, the more problems we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, if nothing is a problem, a hardship, or a frustration to us, we will get through; we will have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to learn to believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that we are trusting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>D. With Faithfulness, Endeavoring, Patience, Endurance, and Much Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In practicing the definite steps of the God-ordained way, we must do so with faithfulness, endeavoring, patience, endurance, and much prayer Col 1:28-29; 1 Cor 15:58 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we will reach our goal.</S>
