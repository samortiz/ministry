This is the second requirement for generating life. Verse 3 reads, "And God said..." God spoke; that was the Word of God. To speak is not a small thing. Suppose I come to the platform and remain silent, while you look at me and I look at you. What is this? This is death. If I am a living person, I cannot just stand here and be silent for an hour. As long as I am living, I must speak. When I speak, it means that I am living, and that what I speak will be something living. God spoke and the Word of God came to bring in the light. "And God said, Let there be light." The divine Word always brings us light. Hallelujah!</P><P>Check with your own experience. First, the Spirit broods over you. Then comes the speaking. Through that speaking, you receive a living Word and that living Word enlightens you within. When God speaks, He commands the light to shine out of darkness. "God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts..." Hallelujah! God's speaking brings in light.</P><P>The Lord Jesus said that whoever hears His Word and believes has life (John 5:24). If we hear the Lord's Word and believe, we have life. James 1:18 tells us that God has brought us forth with His Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) The Light Came&#151;1:3</H2><P>Now we come to the third requirement for generating life: the light came to dispel the darkness that covered the waters of death. Praise the Lord. This is really meaningful. I can testify that when I was saved, it was exactly like this: firstly, the Spirit came; secondly, the Word of God came; thirdly, the light came. I was enlightened within. Something was shining within me. I believe that this was also your experience.</P><P>In addition to 2 Corinthians 4:6, we have John 1:4, 5, and 9. "In the beginning was the Word...In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it" (John 1:1, 4-5). Darkness can never overcome light. Light always dispels darkness. When light comes, darkness must flee.</P><P>Who and what is light? Light is Christ, the living Word of God. When Christ came as the real Light to shine in the darkness, the darkness could not overcome Him. He is the real Light.</P><P>We should remember the three comings: the coming of the Spirit, the coming of the Word, and the coming of Light. Following these comings, are three separations, three divisions.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
