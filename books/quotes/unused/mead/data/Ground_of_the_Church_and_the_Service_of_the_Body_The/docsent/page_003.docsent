   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SCRIPTURAL DEFINITION OF WORKERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous section we addressed the difference between the universal church and the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For the past two thousand years the church has not been able to properly solve the question of how the workers are related to the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The term workers can be used both in a narrow sense and in a broad sense.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a broad sense, all those who serve God are workers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For instance, whenever we go out to preach the gospel and do the Lord s work, we are His workers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a broad sense, it is a fact that all the saved ones are God s servants.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, when we say that the apostle Paul was a servant of God, we say this in a narrower sense.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same principle applies to the term workers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The apostle Paul told the Corinthians, We are God s fellow workers; you are God s cultivated land, God s building 1 Cor 3:9; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2 Cor 6:1 ; moreover, he told Timothy, Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman 2 Tim 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Workers and workman as used in these verses are undoubtedly used in a narrower sense.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this chapter we are speaking of workers in the narrow sense of the word, not the broad sense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In a narrow sense, according to the biblical revelation these workers are those sent by the Lord; that is, they are apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Throughout church history people have held an inaccurate concept concerning apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was young, I heard a preacher solemnly say that throughout the ages there have been only twelve apostles and that once the twelve apostles passed away, there have been no more apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the time, I thought that this concept was scriptural, but the more I read the Bible, the more I felt that it was not true.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For example, both Paul and Barnabas were apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those who hold the view that there were only twelve apostles claim that Paul simply filled the place of Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this were the case, there would still be thirteen apostles, because Barnabas was considered to be an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Acts 14:4 clearly uses the term apostles when speaking of Barnabas and Paul; hence, Barnabas also was an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moreover, Silas was an apostle 15:22 , and there is clear evidence that Timothy also was an apostle Rom 16:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This proves that there were many apostles in the apostles time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there were not many apostles, there would not have been the need to speak of false apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Revelation 2:2 says that there were false apostles: those who call themselves apostles and are not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is only one president in the Philippines; as a result, there is no need to speak of false presidents.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if a nation has three or four presidents, it would be easy to have false presidents.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When some in Corinth questioned whether Paul was an apostle, he said, If to others I am not an apostle, yet surely I am to you 1 Cor 9:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to Revelation 2:2, the church and the believers are able to try those who call themselves apostles in order to verify whether or not they are apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses indicate that there is not a limited number of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They also show that apostles are not limited to a special group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, apostles are weighty people in the church; on the other hand, they are not a special group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the Bible, an apostle is simply a worker who is sent out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>An apostle is a person who is called by God and sent by Him to preach the gospel, save sinners, and establish and edify churches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, workers in a narrow sense refers to those who are sent out by God, that is, the apostles, as spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Later, in Europe the word missionary, a term derived from Latin, emerged.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This word means sent one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In recent days, when people are sent out to preach the gospel by either the Roman Catholic Church or various Protestant denominations, they are referred to as missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because most missionaries have come from the West, there is a new term in Chinese Western missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, the word missionary is equivalent to the New Testament word apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Both missionaries and apostles are people sent by God to preach the gospel and establish churches.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we speak of workers, we are referring to apostles, those sent by God to preach the gospel and establish churches.</S>
