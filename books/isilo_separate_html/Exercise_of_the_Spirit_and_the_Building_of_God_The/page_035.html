<h1 class="title">TWO GREAT GIFTS FROM GOD TO MAN&mdash;<br />
THE HOLY BIBLE AND THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:16; John 5:39; 6:63; Luke 11:13; John 16:13-14</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the relationship between the Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit. The Holy Bible and the Holy Spirit are two great gifts from God to man, and they are the means by which God gives Himself to man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Word of God</h2>
<p>Let us first consider the Holy Bible. Not only do Christians acknowledge that the Bible is a peculiar book, but even many intelligent unbelievers agree that the Bible is the most unique book in the world. No one can deny that the Bible occupies a special place in human history and that the influence of the Bible on mankind is immeasurably profound and far-reaching. The Bible occupies such a special place because it is the Word of God. In principle, all the words of God to man are contained in the Bible. Apart from the Bible, we would not know what God has spoken to man. God&rsquo;s speaking to man in the past is recorded in the Bible, and God&rsquo;s speaking to man in the future is also contained in the Bible. The Bible is the Word of God because it is God&rsquo;s speaking to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being a Means for God to Give Himself to Man</h2>
<p>The Word of God is the crucial means through which God gives Himself to man. The Bible is the means by which God gives Himself for man to possess and enjoy. A cup is the means to give someone a drink of water. Without a cup, it is difficult to give a person some water to drink. Therefore, the cup is the means for drinking water. Likewise, God gives Himself as living water to us for our enjoyment through His Word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Revelation and Explanation of Christ</h2>
<p>God becomes our enjoyment in His Son, Christ. God is in Christ so that He can be enjoyed by us. In other words, Christ is God coming to be enjoyed by us. Since the Bible is the means for God to be enjoyed by man and God is enjoyed by man in Christ, this glorious and rich Christ must be the center and content of the Bible. If we want to enjoy God, we must enjoy Christ, and if we want to gain God, we must gain Christ. Apart from Christ, we cannot find, meet, contact, or gain God. Apart from Christ, we cannot enjoy God. We must be in Christ in order to have a subjective relationship with God.</p>
<p>How does Christ transmit Himself into us? How are we able to contact Him? It is through His Word, the Bible. He is embodied in the Word, through which He transmits Himself into us by revelation and explanation. The Word is the revelation and explanation of Christ. We gain Christ in the Word; He reveals and explains Himself to us through the Word. When we read the Bible, we must realize that the Bible is the revelation and explanation of Christ.</p>
<p>God needs to reveal and explain Christ to us through the Bible because we human beings are rational creatures. Man was created in God&rsquo;s image. God is rational, so He created man to be rational. Hence, in order for something to enter into us, it must pass through our reasoning and be accepted by our reasoning. God is Spirit, but if He wants us to enjoy Him, He must reveal and explain Himself to us through the Word so that He can pass through our reasoning. When He passes through our reasoning, He can enter into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Conveying the Spirit</h2>
<p>The Bible is not only the revelation and explanation of Christ; it also conveys Christ as the Spirit. Apparently, the Bible is no different from any other book in the world in terms of being a book printed on paper. However, there is a fundamental difference between the Bible and other books. After people read other books, they do not feel that something has entered their spirit. But when a person reads the Bible, he can touch the living Spirit. Even though it seems as if he is reading only the printed words, he can be contacting the living God. The Bible is unique because it conveys the Spirit. The Spirit is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; in the words of the Bible.</p>
<p>When we read a secular book, our mind receives knowledge, and our feelings can be touched, because knowledge and emotions are &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; in words. In the same way, the words of the Bible convey not only the knowledge of God but also the Spirit of God. When we read the Word of God, we gain not only knowledge in our mind but also the Spirit in our spirit. When we read the Bible, we should pray in our spirit because the Spirit conveyed in the words of the Bible has touched our spirit. At best, secular books open a reader&rsquo;s mind, causing him to understand a concept, or they stir up the reader&rsquo;s emotion, because what they convey affects our thoughts and affections but not our spirit. What the Bible conveys, however, affects not only our thoughts and emotions but also our spirit. When we read the Bible, the Spirit touches our spirit and generates prayers from the depth of our being. This proves that the living Christ is embodied in the words of the Bible. When we read the Bible, we touch the Spirit of Christ. As a result, we receive not only teachings, which affect our mind, but also the life supply in our spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
