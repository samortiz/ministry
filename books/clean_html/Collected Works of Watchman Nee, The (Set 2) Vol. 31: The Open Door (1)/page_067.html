<h2 class="head2">Canton</h2><p>Sister Ro-chen:</p><p>May you have peace in the Lord! I left Canton on the twenty-third of last month and went with a colleague and a few of his relatives to Wu-Chow in Kwangsi province. Then we went on west to Teng-Shian in Kwangsi. I was originally going to stay there for awhile, but I received a telegram telling me to return immediately to Canton. I arrived in Canton on January 1. There are now more than ten brothers and sisters in Canton. There are still three sisters in Rou-Zhi Hospital, Sister Liu, Sister Hsue, and Sister Yi. Puo-Zhi Hospital has two sisters, Sister Liu and Sister Tu. Sister Hung Chi-hwai from the Women's and Children's Hospital still comes often. Sister Lin Siao-ching and her mother are also here. Sister Liang Siu-jeng has not come for a long time because she is too busy with her job. Brother Huang and his wife from Hua-Di are in the same place. Brothers Mai, Wang, and Huang (Hua-shun) are all well. Peace to you and Sister Kuo.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang-ming<br />January 4</p><h2 class="head2">Sien-You, Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to our dear Brother Watchman and to all the brothers and sisters in Hankow:</p><p>We think that you probably are not familiar with Sien-You in Fukien province. However, thanks be to the loving Lord for doing a great work in this little place. God sent his servants Faithful Luk and Chen Jai-seng to begin a new work in February 1936. At that time a few sinners received grace and were saved. Later the brothers met in their homes and came together every Lord's Day evening to break bread in remembrance of the Lord. There were only five people. Last summer, the Lord sent His servant, Mr. Chai Wu-wuo, to work for more than a month, and a few more were saved. Because there were many people, we rented a place last fall where the brothers and sisters could meet, preach the gospel, and remember the Lord. Last winter, the Lord sent His servants to work among us, and twenty-five people obeyed the Lord and were baptized. There are now about forty-eight brothers and sisters in the table meeting. In the past month the Lord has done a great work, and more than ninety people were saved. We hope that the brothers and sisters will pray for us. May God encourage us with His love to be faithful in testifying strongly for Him so that saved ones may be added to our number daily, amen. Thank and praise God, it is still safe in Sien-You. We really remember the brothers and sisters in the war zone. We remember them each time we pray. We are remitting the offering from one Lord's Day of X dollars in a wire to Miss Ruth Lee to distribute for us. We are really ashamed that we are so lacking in love. May God stir up our heart of love more that we would glorify His name in the Body life until the day the Lord returns.</p><p>The church in Sien-You</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>We are sending a postal money order from the Lord's Day offering of X dollars and X cents in stamps. Please distribute it for us to the brothers who have a lack from the war or for the needs of the work in the remote areas. (This money has already been given to K'un-ming for the use of the work&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>The church in Sien-You<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Han-Jiang, Fukien Province</h2><p>Peace to Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>We wired X dollars through the local bank yesterday. It is the offering of brothers and sisters in the church in Han-Jiang for the use of those who are suffering from the war. Please accept it, check the amount, and then distribute it for us. Sister Bao Hsu-min began a one-week sisters' conference in Han-Jiang (tentatively). Please pray for it. The sisters in Han-Jiang need perfecting. If you have the chance and are led by the Lord, we hope that you can come to help us. (I will consider this matter in prayer&mdash;note from Ruth.) The brothers and sisters in the coastal region of Fukien are all safe. Please do not worry about us. Peace to you. Second Corinthians 12:9.</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Fang Shi-rong, Fang Kun-cheng<br />January 13<br />[Address omitted]</p>
