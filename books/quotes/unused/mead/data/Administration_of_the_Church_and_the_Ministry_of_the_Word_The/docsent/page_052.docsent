   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Covering Much Material</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible-reading meeting, it is best to read one chapter a week.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is not advisable to cover too much material.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This can be compared to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we swallow food without chewing, we cannot taste the food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One chapter a week may be considered rather slow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since the saints come together only once a week, some churches encouraged the saints to read one chapter a day at home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this way they can read six chapters in a week.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, they should not cover all six chapters when they come together to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, it is best to cover only one chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, whether in giving a message or reading the Word together, we should never try to cover too much material.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a great principle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is very good to release one point in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Releasing two or more points may cause the meeting to lose its focus and be ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, it is not good to cover too much material.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read six chapters of the Bible per week, we will read more than three hundred chapters in fifty-two weeks, but we may not remember that much.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if we read one chapter a week in the meeting with light and supply, we will read fifty-two chapters in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How rich that will be!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This will give the saints a good impression and stir up their love for reading the Bible, causing them to read the Bible by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They may even read six chapters a day.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way they will build up the personal habit of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Making the Word Tasty to People</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Immediately after I was saved, I loved the Bible and was perfected in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should extract the life supply from the Bible to feed the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this way they will acquire a taste, desire the supply, and enjoy reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They will even enjoy reading the Bible by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If six chapters are covered in the Bible-reading meeting every week, there will not be any enjoyment, and the saints will become disinterested and bored.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we should not read too many chapters, lest our haste makes waste, and we get exactly the opposite effect.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is best to read one chapter, and extract the riches from this portion to feed the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then the saints will feel that the Bible is so sweet and rich and will want to continue coming to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They will even study the Bible at home.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, it is not advisable to read many chapters in the Bible-reading meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, the saints should read one or more chapters a day by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who are responsible for ministering the word must study how to conduct the Bible-reading meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must first have some solid and nutritious food for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then we must make the meeting tasty for the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Of course, we should not use gimmicks, but we should give the saints the feeling that they have gained something.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this way they will even invite others to come and listen to the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, the Bible-reading meeting and the ministry of the word are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Recently a church began a meeting for the pursuit of Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures on the Lord s Day evening.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The number participating in this meeting was greater than that in the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There were between one hundred forty to one hundred fifty people in the meeting even though the meeting hall can only accommodate approximately one hundred thirty people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people sat in the courtyard.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Another church in the south of Taiwan began a Bible-reading meeting in which the attendance went from sixty people to one hundred forty.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The saints gained a solid supply.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is worthwhile for us to study together.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Supply of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Having a Focus and Being General</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the brothers taking the lead in the Bible-reading meeting sense that something is the need of the church, they should consider how to impress this point on the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They should not speak concerning this point lightly but should repeat it emphatically until the saints receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In northern China I spent about five years speaking concerning the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every day I hammered this burden into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I used every opportunity to speak of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My way was to repeatedly and continually drive the matter of the cross into every brother and sister.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This practice is good but we should not carry it out too rigidly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Furthermore, we should be general in emphasizing a burden so that other needs can be met.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A local church should focus on the ministry of the word, but it should also take care of other aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For example, when I emphasized the cross in northern China, my speaking also covered other needs.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should observe everything and take care of matters as they arise.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to take care of the elders, the deacons, those who visit people, and those who are burdened to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do not take care of all the needs, our locality may be perfected in one need but be lacking in another need.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For example, if a brother continually speaks on the flesh, neglecting other needs, the bread-breaking meeting may become dry because everyone will be concerned with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Likewise, the gospel preaching will stop because everyone is speaking about the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even the church services may dry up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we should take care of the various needs.</S>
