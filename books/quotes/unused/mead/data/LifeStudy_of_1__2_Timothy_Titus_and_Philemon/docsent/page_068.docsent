   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I treasure verses 9 through 12 because they reveal that the relationship among Paul and his co-workers was divinely arranged; it was not based on human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul's co-workers had the freedom to act on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul did not say, "Titus, don't go to Dalmatia.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I need you to stay here with me.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you leave, I shall fire you from the work."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But although there was no human organization, there was a divine arrangement in which the leading apostle was the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, Paul could charge Timothy to come to him quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the years I was with Brother Nee, many co-workers came to him for advice, wanting him to tell them what to do regarding certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Very rarely, if ever, would Brother Nee say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, along with others who knew the situation, I can testify that whenever I asked Brother Nee about something, he always gave me a direct answer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes when I was in a distant city, he would send me a cable telling me either to come to him or to go to a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we compare the books of 2 Timothy and Titus, we shall see that there was greater intimacy between Paul and Timothy than between Paul and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Yes, Paul wrote an epistle to Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But he could not say as much to Titus as he could to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To such an intimate co-worker as Timothy, Paul could issue a command for him to come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul and his co-workers were not related to one another in the way of organization.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that Paul did not regard himself as a boss who could hire or fire co-workers at his discretion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Likewise, because there is no organization in the Lord's recovery today, there is no hiring or firing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have seen that, due to the attraction of the present age, Demas forsook the apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verses 8 and 10 we have a contrast between loving the Lord's appearing and loving the present age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we love the Lord's appearing, we shall take sides with Him and fight with Him for His interests.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we love the present age, we shall take sides with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even though Demas loved the present age and forsook Paul, Paul does not say that he dismissed him from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, Crescens and Titus may have left Paul without having been sent by him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps, deep within, Paul wanted Titus to stay with him to help and support him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whatever the situation may have been, these verses make it clear that Paul did not use his authority according to the way of human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of those who have been co-workers for more than thirty years can testify that in the Lord's recovery we do not have a human organization with a boss who exercises authority to hire or fire co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of organization, we have God's coordination with His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because there was also such coordination and authority among Paul and his co-workers, he could tell Timothy to come to him quickly, and he could send Tychicus to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to Philippians 2, Timothy was one with Paul in a very intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was one soul with him and was even willing to risk his soul for the work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because of this oneness, this intimacy, Paul could command Timothy to come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He could also send Tychicus to Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This, however, is not organization.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, it is according to the spiritual situation among those in God's coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How much the leading ones in God's coordination can say to you depends on the extent to which you are one with the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not a matter of organization, but of the degree of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, "The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This word also reveals the intimacy between Paul and Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Troas was a seaport in northwest Asia Minor, where Paul received the Macedonian call Acts 16:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The scrolls and the parchments were materials used for writing in ancient times.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The cloak was probably a traveling cloak or traveling case.</S>
