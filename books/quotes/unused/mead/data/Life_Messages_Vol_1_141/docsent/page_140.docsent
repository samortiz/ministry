   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How can we stay on the pathway of life when we come to the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have been trying to do this and praying that the Lord will help me to experience life in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But for so many years I came to the Bible for knowledge that even when I am in the midst of seeking the Lord, I find I have turned back to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most crucial matter is that you need a change in your concept.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yes, we formerly came to the Bible for knowledge, but now you must realize your need of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When you come to the Bible, don't analyze whether you are coming for knowledge or for life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you analyze, you are for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Just come to the Bible for the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many times this supply comes through the proper knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But don't begin to wonder what the proper knowledge is and how you can get it!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just have a change in your view of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are coming for the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then whether you read, pray-read, or study, the result will be that life is supplied to you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is it accurate to say that the blood cleanses our soul?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One of the hymns we sing refers to the "soul-cleansing blood."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The redeeming blood cleanses us from any sin or defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is probably better to avoid using this term in ordinary talk, though I would not say that it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The soul means the self.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The blood does cleanse us from our sins, but we do not need to call it the "soul-cleansing" blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In our writings we try to stay away from any questionable terminology.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We don't condemn what others use, but we don't necessarily adopt their terms either.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Could you give us a practical way to deal with our mind when we find we are distracted?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I often find my mind is somewhere else, particularly when I'm in the meetings!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can I turn it back and be in my spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not be discouraged that your efforts to stay in your spirit are a failure many times.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you first begin exercising to deduct the feelings in your mind, your will, and your emotions, you will find you are "adding" instead!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Keep working on it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At first, you must exercise legally; this practice in the early stage is actually an "addition."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, however, when your "subtracting" becomes a habit, it will be spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you will have the real "subtraction."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A SEED IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once we are saved, we sense that something has happened deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not the same as we were.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nonetheless, questions begin to arise: Why have we changed so little?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why is our mentality still so dark?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How come our emotions are still impure?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How is it that our heart is not really honest?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regeneration means that a seed has been planted in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The divine, uncreated, eternal, unlimited life has been sown into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At first it does not occupy very much even of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For this reason we may go on in the same way as we did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even so, because of this seed we can never be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>PAYING ATTENTION TO OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even those of us in the Lord's recovery pay very little attention to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The best exercise in our Christian life is to call our being back to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thinking is a distraction; rather than heed your mentality, be tuned in to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whenever Christians seek holiness or victory, they invariably fall short.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Their morality may improve somewhat, but until they realize that the Christian life is a matter in our spirit, where the life of God is realized and enjoyed, they will not succeed in living victoriously.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On a recent trip to the Northwest I was staying in a couple's home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They put me in the best room.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everything was fine, except that when it got dark I could not find the switch to turn on the light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I groped about here and there, but my efforts to locate the switch were all in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Finally I had to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The switch turned out to be hidden behind the mirror on the dresser.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It never would have occurred to me to look there!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is not this a picture of Christians, striving to be victorious but groping in the dark because they do not know where the switch is?</S>
