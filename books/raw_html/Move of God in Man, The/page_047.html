<P>Merely to come on time for the training classes does not in itself build up your character. Your character must be built up in resurrection, and character is built up mainly in the sundry things, the small things in your daily life. When you place a book on a desk it should be placed there in a straight, orderly way, not in a haphazard way. If I do not leave a book on my desk in an orderly fashion, something within tells me to go back and adjust it. After working at a desk, some of us would leave the things on our desk in disarray and would not put our chair under the desk. This shows that we do not have a character which is built up in resurrection.</P><P>After the Lord fed the five thousand, He charged the disciples to gather the leftovers, and they filled twelve baskets full (John 6:12-13). He did not leave in excitement and forget about the leftovers lying all over the ground. Nobody took care of the leftovers, so the Lord and His disciples bore the responsibility to pick them up. That was a display of the Lord's character, a display of resurrection.</P><P>We can also see what kind of character the Lord Jesus had when He resurrected. After Christ resurrected, Peter and John entered into the tomb and they saw the linen cloths lying there and "the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart" (John 20:6-7). All the things left in the tomb were a testimony to the Lord's resurrection. If these things had not been left there in a good order, it would have been difficult for Peter and John to believe (v. 8) that the Lord had not been taken away by someone but had risen by Himself.</P><P>If we were the ones who had been resurrected, we would have been very excited, leaving everything in the tomb a mess. Even though the Lord resurrected from the tomb, He still left everything in good order. He got up in resurrection, and made His bed. His making of that bed in the tomb was a display of resurrection. I can testify that I cannot go away after rising in the morning without making my bed. After rising up, the first thing I do is to make my bed; then I am released.</P><P>Resurrection is the very living God who has been consummated to be the life-giving Spirit to live in us a life in order. Look at the universe God created. Everything is in good order. God has His divine character. I am sharing these things to impress us that resurrection should become our life. We should live in resurrection. When we live in the resurrection of Christ, the processed God is living in us, so that is a part of God's move in humanity. That becomes a part of the history of God living within man. Thus, our living becomes His history. This means that He has become us to make us Him. He and we, we and He, are mingled together. We two live one life, so we have one living and one history. Our story is His history, and His history is our daily life in resurrection. The move of God in man is in our living in the resurrection of Christ.</P>
