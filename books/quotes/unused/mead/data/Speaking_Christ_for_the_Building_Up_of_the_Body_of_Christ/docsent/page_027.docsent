   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE PRACTICE OF MEETING 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the practice of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In particular, we want to cover some crucial points concerning our need to pay full attention to the way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>GETTING YOURSELF PREPARED</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO SPEAK IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must pay our full attention to the way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are going to speak properly, we must get ourselves prepared to speak in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Unless we are burdened to speak or assigned to speak, we may not have any thought to speak in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our thought is that somebody else will speak and that we do not need to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have been a Christian for twenty years and have attended three meetings a week, you have been in about three thousand meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On these three thousand occasions, how many times did you consider speaking in the meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Possibly you never once considered that you needed to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was always someone there to speak for you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this reason it is hard for us to change our way today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our speaking function has been annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a child is not given any opportunity to speak for twenty years, he will be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His speaking function will be annulled by his lack of speaking and practicing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This illustrates our problem today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have so many saints among us today who love the Lord and are faithful to the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, some who have been among us for many years have been annulled due to the old way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we do speak, we must learn how to speak properly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must all practice and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Over fifty years ago Brother Watchman Nee, the pioneer in the Lord s recovery among us, saw the light concerning the way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He put what he saw into printed messages, yet we did not find a way to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We had nothing with which to replace our old way of one man speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we have been in the line of the recovery for over sixty years, and we have had much practice and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By the Lord s mercy, we have published a number of books concerning the scriptural way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we have a way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We also have many publications in truth and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These publications are a great storage of groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our only need is to learn how to cook them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever you attend a meeting, the first thought you should have is to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Get prepared to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether the actual time for you to speak will come or not is another matter, but you must have the thought to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To go to the meeting is to go to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To go to a meeting is not to go to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To go to a feast is not to go to look at the feast or talk about the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At a feast the main thing is to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the first item of the proper way of speaking is to get yourself prepared to speak in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>NOT OVERLAPPING OTHERS SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we speak, we should not overlap others speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There should be no overlapping but rather a good continuation from one person s speaking to the next person s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One speaks while all the others wait; then the next one speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Between the preceding speaking and your speaking there must be a little selah as in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Stop for a while; it is more meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then you will have a good continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There will not be noise, but a proper voice in a good continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although this may not be too easy with a hundred or a thousand meeting together, the meeting should still have a good sequence and a good continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>NOT TOO LOW OR TOO SLOW,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>NEITHER TOO LOUD NOR TOO FAST</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our speaking should not be too low without loving the audience s ears.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may love your throat too much.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Instead, you should love others ears.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Learn to speak audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You must sound out your voice that it may be audible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are not speaking to yourself; you are speaking to others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should also not speak too slow to exhaust the audience s patience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To speak too low or too slow is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all have to hate these two ways of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, we should not speak too loud to hurt the audience s ears, nor should we speak too fast to puzzle the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Often I was puzzled at someone s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I could not follow it.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must learn not to speak too low or too slow; neither should we speak too loud nor too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may learn to speak properly in our homes by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We mean business in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our Christian life is altogether focused on the meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If there were no meeting life, there would be no Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These matters are quite important and are worthy of our study.</S>
