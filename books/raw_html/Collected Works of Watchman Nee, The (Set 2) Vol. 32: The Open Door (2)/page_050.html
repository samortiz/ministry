<h2 class="head2">Lung-Ju-Tsai, Shensi Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>I left Sian and traveled through the churches in Shing-Ping, Shang-Jen, Mei County, Kwei-Ya-Jen, and Sin-Chuang and met many brothers and sisters. Although they live in remote and inaccessible mountain regions, they love the Lord very much, and I was very touched. I spent two weeks on the road and then returned to Sian. I stayed in Sian for a week, going to the houses of the believers and fellowshipping with them. This has reaped much benefit for me. On July 16 I went from Sian to Shang-Chow Union. I stayed there for five or six days and conducted meetings every morning, afternoon, and evening. They all witnessed the Lord's blessing. On the twenty-second I came to the church in Lung-Ju-Tsai. Let me relate a little concerning the condition among the Tsinghai natives of this inland region. Four years ago the Lord led me into the inland regions of Tsinghai to preach the gospel to the natives. I was born in Honan, and prior to this, I had never traveled far. In 1932 the Lord directed Brother Duan Chai-ju and myself to go to Tsinghai. We set out on September 11, 1932, from Shantung and walked by foot to the west through the provinces of Hopeh, Honan, Shansi, Shensi, and Kansu. In 1934 the Lord led us into Tsinghai and the western part of Tsinghai to preach the gospel to the natives. The interior of Tsinghai province is inhabited exclusively by nomadic tribesmen. Their cultures and habits are vastly different from ours, the Han Chinese. I spent about a year in Tsinghai and cannot enumerate all the benefits and help I received through my stay.</p><p>It has been almost seven years since I was commissioned by the Lord to preach the gospel. Everywhere we went, we saw the Lord's power, glory, and wonderful work. When I consider all these things, my heart is filled with joy. Hallelujah. Praise our precious Lord Jesus! I will probably not be able to stay here for long. Later, I will go west again. The meetings here will begin September 1. I ask the brothers and sisters in the Lord to pray much for me. Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Hu Tien-en, August 24</p><h2 class="head2">Gao-Mi, Shantung Province</h2><p>Dear brothers and sisters in the Lord:</p><p>In April, I related the condition here to you briefly. I trust that you have remembered us in your prayer. There has not been much progress within the past few months. We do not know how to obey and how to deny ourselves. There is still much need for your prayer. Presently, we have Bible study meetings on Monday and Wednesday. We are studying the truth concerning the church. On Friday we have a prayer meeting, and on the Lord's Day we hope to start a bread-breaking meeting. There are many difficulties, and we are still praying. In everything we are learning.</p><p>We only have a little spark within our heart, and the enemy is already becoming indignant. He is attacking us from all sides through small matters. Please remember the church in Gao-Mi and your weak brother often. In April Brother Chang Tze-jieh had some meetings in Gao-Mi, and one brother was saved. His condition is very good now, but we still need much edification. Brother Witness Lee may come later. We can only ask the Lord of the harvest to send His laborers to come quickly and to accomplish His work so that His name may receive much glory. May the Lord's grace abound.</p><p>Brothers in the Lord,<br />Wang Shu-ge and Hu Shen-fu, August 15</p><h2 class="head2">Foochow</h2><p>The various places in Fukien are at peace, except Foochow, which experiences occasional air raids. There was a large-scale air bombing in the city the day before yesterday. All of the neighboring houses were destroyed. Our house was shaken and slightly damaged, but on the whole, it was preserved. From this we see the Lord's care of His people. He is worthy to be praised! We have moved into Chang-Chien-Shan. If there are no further changes in Foochow, we will remain. If we move, we will inform you. All the brothers and sisters in Foochow are well. Some have moved to the upper regions in the rural areas. The Lord has brought the gospel to the remote regions through these tribulations. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Brother Hsu Shiao-hwa<br />with Sisters Hsu Shiao-keng and Hsu Shiao-fang, July 14</p>
