   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Present Condition</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A few believers from this locality have recently scattered to Changchow, Hsien You, and Fu Ch'ing because of their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They are doing proper jobs in these counties.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank the Lord for opening the way for His children, lest they be taunted as "jobless believers."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although it seems that there are more empty seats every time we meet, we believe that the Lord who wants all men to be saved will add more brothers and sisters to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In September of this year, two brothers and nine sisters obeyed and were baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>May the Lord's Spirit continue to work in the hearts of those who are waiting to be baptized and take the table.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We hope that they will obey the Lord one by one in the near future so that they will remember the Lord and have fellowship together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the denominations there are also quite a few who have been helped either directly through face-to-face discussions or indirectly through the tracts or publications , to the point that they can believe God's Word and understand the truth of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unfortunately, because of friendship, reputation, authority, position, occupation, or other matters of their living, they do not dare practice and obey the truth to walk in the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>May the Lord's hand touch these people's hearts and complete the good work He has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the general condition of the meeting in P'u T'ien.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is really nothing and is not worth recording, but we have the obligation to fellowship in mutuality in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since this is the result of the Lord's labor, we dare to write what we know of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These have really been the marvelous doings of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are merely useless servants.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"You have also performed all our works for us" Isa 26:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May that which is of ourselves be completely brought to naught.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May the Lord only be elevated and glorified here eternally!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Dear brothers and sisters, we have told you our history.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason, we would ask you to pay particular attention to the fact that there is a group of immature and weak ones here who have just begun a work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all need your prayers very much.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we hope you will pray for us publicly and in private and that you will remember us constantly, mentioning the work here often.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is our last request of you in this letter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We deeply believe that the Lord who loves to hear our prayers will open His eyes, listen with His ears, and smilingly open His heart of love to receive our prayers in one accord from different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, He is the faithful, almighty God; He will do everything beyond what we ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should sing Hallelujah loudly together.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We bless you with peace, joy, and victory!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your brothers in P'u T'ien,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Tai Hsien Hsin, Chen Chieh P'ing</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>October 30, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Mailing address: 6 Riverside, P'u T'ien, Fukien</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A LETTER FROM BROTHER CHEN TSAI SHENG From P'u T'ien to Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peace to Brother Luk:</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since parting I have thought of you in my prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was comforted by receiving your letters.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I am happy that Brother Nee has someone to help him but sad that Brother Chung's father had a tragic encounter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It really makes me sad and worried.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Members are related to each other, and it is natural for them to express their sympathy to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After the end of the conference in Hangchow, the Lord gained the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although I did not attend, I received the good messages through letters, and they have given me much edification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I agree that it is the right time to talk about the matter of appointment in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of course, we cannot lay hands on others hastily; the matter must be carried out soberly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is a good opportunity in Yu Hsi.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother Wei Chih sent a letter of invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will wait for your return to make the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am enclosing a picture he took so you can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The truth that Brothers P'an and Nee spoke concerning the matter of head covering gave me much light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not plan to speak on this matter now.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is equally a lack for the sisters in P'u T'ien and Han Chiang not to cover their heads as it is for the brothers not to take care of things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I heard that they are planning to start an oil factory in northern Kiangsu and a soap factory in Amoy to help the unemployed brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is really a good move.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can only help with our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The gifts are for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do your best to remain free.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not worry about me.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Lord lead you concerning the matters of work and moving your family.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Brother, because of the shining light of the truth, I have entered into a deep valley where it is difficult to move forward or backward.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we were in Ya T'an, I felt that our way and work did not match the truth, so I parted with them and followed at your side, helping you as Timothy followed Paul and learned from him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Now I feel that the way I am taking is right, but because of the light of the truth I feel that the work I am engaged in presently is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, I have shed a few tears of sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord's grace is sufficient for me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I am patiently waiting for His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Please do not forget to help me with your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is good that the brothers in Shanghai think I should be responsible for the work in at least two localities.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, the burden for the work in two localities has been given by God to the elders and deacons to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since I am not a local believer nor a gift of a shepherd, I dare not continue the evangelist's work or the teacher's work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>According to the principle of work in the Bible, the evangelist begets the children first, the shepherd continues by feeding them, and the teacher continues by teaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Later the elders and the deacons rise up to oversee and help them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After this, various gifts often come to work to perfect the saints, allowing the Holy Spirit to pour out other gifts on the local saints so that the gospel will be preached by them to other places.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the principle of the development of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In another aspect, the saints come to understand the truth, know their own gift, and stand in their ministry in the Body in their own position to serve God and perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the way to build up the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If one takes charge of a locality or controls one place, this is the beginning of a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It will fall into the danger of collapsing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Brother, this is my ignorant opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I would be very grateful if you would teach me.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Brother, the two years that I have been in P'u T'ien have been a time of preparation for me to be a useful vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the one hand, I have learned from you, and on the other hand, I have been striving to know my gift.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In this time of preparation, I am waiting for God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am also testing the result of my labor so that I can serve the Lord well for my whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I do not want to run the race in vain or do a vain labor.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>According to my present endeavor, what position should I take in the Body and how should I function?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Brother, I still have many difficult questions, and I hope Brother Nee can come soon, so I can ask him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Please tell him this and also congratulate him for me and greet him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Tsai Sheng</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>October 30</S>
