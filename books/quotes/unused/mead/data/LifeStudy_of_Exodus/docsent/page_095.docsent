   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY OF GOD S LEADING A. In Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Immediately after the word about Joseph s bones, we have a record regarding the leading and guidance of the Lord 13:20-21; see also 13:17-18; 12:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This marvelous sequence indicates that God cannot guide people apart from resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His guidance is available only to bones that move in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the dry bones become living and begin to walk out of Egypt, God s guidance comes to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For many years I wondered why Joseph s bones are mentioned in relation to the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire 13:19-22 , both of which signify God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fact that the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire are mentioned in relation to Joseph s bones indicates that God s living leading and guidance are related to resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the dead bones move, God s leading comes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we move in resurrection life, we spontaneously have God s guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christians today are seeking the Lord s will; they earnestly desire His leading and guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, the more they seek these things, the less they have them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reason for this lack is that these believers are not bones that have been buried and resurrected; they are not bones that move in the power of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to have the Lord s leading and guidance, the buried bones must be raised out of the tomb and begin to move.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Following the Lord s Command</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Chapter twelve speaks of the exodus of the children of Israel, but nothing is said about the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is found in chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the children of Israel had gone out of Egypt by themselves, they would have made a serious mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to make a proper exodus, they had to have the Lord s guidance and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Exodus 12 we have the Lord s command, and in Exodus 13 we have the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In spiritual matters, it is not sufficient to have only the Lord s command and not His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To have His command but not His leading would be tragic.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His command must always be followed by His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was right for the children of Israel to observe the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their environment had been subdued by the Lord, and they were ready to march out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, as the concluding verses of chapter thirteen make clear, God s people could have then taken one of two ways: the short way or the roundabout way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to the natural understanding, they certainly would have chosen the short way, not the roundabout way that involved a long detour.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the way the children of Israel were to take did not depend on them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It did not even depend on Moses or Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It depended absolutely on the Lord s leading through the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apart from the Lord s leading, God s people had no right to move.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the children of Israel had moved without the Lord s leading in the pillar of fire or in the pillar of cloud, they would have been moving on their own and in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is never right to do this in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Along with God s command, we must have His leading and His guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If He asks us to do something, we should not do it on our own.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, we should pray, Lord, since You ask me to do this, You must guide me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Lead me by the pillar of fire or by the pillar of cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although chapter thirteen may appear to be an insertion between chapters twelve and fourteen, actually it is not an insertion at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the contrary, this chapter is necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It reveals that we need the Lord s guidance as well as His command.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. According to Certain Conditions</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, this chapter reveals that the Lord s guidance and leading come only when certain conditions are met.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His leading and guidance are not unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The first condition is sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are not sanctified, we cannot have the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also need to experience the new beginning of an unleavened life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be sanctified and to have the new beginning of a sinless life are the first two requirements to be able to receive the Lord s guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another condition is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To be led of the Lord, we must not be in the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our bones must be resurrected and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then, when we are no longer in the natural man, we shall have the Lord s leading and guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have pointed out that the Bible refers to the natural man as flesh and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When Peter received the revelation that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord answered, You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens Matt 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, after Christ had been revealed to Paul, Paul did not confer with flesh and blood; that is, he did not confer with the natural man Gal 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As we have pointed out, the moving of Joseph s bones signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although these bones were dry, they were still able to move.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a picture of a man in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Such a person can be guided by the Lord and led by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we are in resurrection, we are qualified to receive the Lord s guidance and leading.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Actually, the Lord s leading and guidance are simply the Lord Himself in the pillar of fire by night and in the pillar of cloud by day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As the children of Israel marched out of Egypt in martial array, they were led by the pillar of fire or the pillar of cloud.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Egyptians must have been terrified by such a sight.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The portrait of the children of Israel marching out of Egypt according to the Lord s guidance reveals that the Lord s leading is given only when we have fulfilled His conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to be sanctified, we need to have the new beginning of a sinless life, and we need to be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then we shall be guided by the Lord and led by Him.</S>
