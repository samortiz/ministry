GOD'S VICTORY IN CHRIST<br>AS THE CENTER, TYPIFIED BY THE ARK</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Moses' Prayer for Jehovah to Arise</H2><P>In verse 1 we have the prayer of Moses, the representative of God's elect, for Jehovah to arise and for His enemies to be scattered (v. 14). The enemies here typify Satan and his forces in the heavenlies (Eph. 6:12). This prayer was actually the aspiration of all God's elect people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Kings of His Enemies' Armies Fleeing</H2><P>"The kings of the armies flee./They flee!" (Psa. 68:12a). These kings, who were defeated and scattered, typify Satan and the rulers (Eph. 6:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. A Great Host of Women of Israel<br>Bearing Glad Tidings</H2><P>"The women who bear the glad tidings are a great host" (Psa. 68:11b). These women of Israel signify the weak ones. As believers today, we are the weak ones, those who cannot do anything except bear, preach, the glad tidings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. She Who Abides at Home Dividing the Spoil</H2><P>"She who abides at home/Divides the spoil" (v. 12b). The "she" here is collective and refers to the women in verse 11. To abide at home signifies not to be at work. The spoil signifies all the gains of the accomplishment, consummation, attainment, and obtainment of Christ as the reapings of the victory of His death, resurrection, and ascension. This spoil includes dove wings covered with silver and pinions covered with greenish yellow gold.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Though They Lie among the Sheepfolds</H2><P>They will divide the spoil even though they lie among the sheepfolds (v. 13a). The "you" in verse 13a refers to the collective "she" in verse 12 and the women in verse 11. Lying among the sheepfolds signifies resting in God's provision and care for His elect.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_207.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_209.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 208</div><br></body></html>
