   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE LAWS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A believer must learn to know the sense of the spirit because this is the first condition of walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If he does not know what is the sense of the spirit and the feeling of the soul, he will not be able to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we are hungry, we know that we must eat.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are cold, we know that we should put on clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our senses tell us our needs and demands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A man must be able to interpret the senses in his body before he will know how to meet its needs with material things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the same way, a believer must learn to know the senses in his spirit what they mean, what their demands are, and how to meet their demands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only when a believer knows the senses of his spirit can he walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are a few things concerning the laws of the spirit which we must know.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because we do not understand the laws of the spirit and the importance of the senses of the spirit, many times when the spirit expresses its desires, we are still ignorant of them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since we fail to identify the many things that come from the spirit as being spiritual, the spirit loses its place in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After we know that the spirit has the function of the intuition, fellowship, and conscience, we must still learn to know its activities and how to walk according to this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After we have been filled with the Holy Spirit, our spirit will surely become very active.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we then ignore it, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is very important to have a habit of examining the moving of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should know the activities of our spirit more than the activities of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE WEIGHT OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The spirit should be kept in a very free condition.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It should constantly be light, as though soaring in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only then will life grow and the work go on unhindered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, a believer must know the meaning of spiritual weight.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times he feels that his spirit is suppressed and not free; a thousand pounds of weight seem to press upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When he searches for a reason for such weight, he may not find any.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, many times this weight creeps in suddenly upon a believer without his even noticing it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This weight is the enemy's means of suppressing spiritual believers; it takes away their joy and lightness so that they can no longer work with the Holy Spirit, and consequently, they lose their spiritual effectiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If believers do not understand the source of this weight and the meaning of the suppression in their spirit, they will not know how to deal with it in order to immediately recover their spirit to a state of normalcy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Believers may wonder about the cause of such feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may think that this is something natural or accidental.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They may heedlessly allow their spirit to be suppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many times believers ignore such weight and continue with their work, only to find that it becomes worse and worse.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They do not realize that the enemy is playing tricks on them with the weight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times, God wants to use these believers, but they are not able to fulfill God's work because of this weight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Under this suppression, spiritual senses become very dull.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why Satan and his evil spirits concentrate their efforts on applying weight to the believers' spirit and on taking away their freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unfortunately, many believers do not realize that this weight comes from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even if they know, they do not reject it; they allow it to remain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If believers carry this weight around with them, they will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If they find themselves with this weight in the morning and do not immediately remove it, they will be defeated the entire day.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A free spirit is the basis for victory.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must have a perfectly unbound spirit before we can battle with the enemy and live out God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there is any pressure in a believer's spirit, he will lose his power of discernment and the genuine leading from God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the spirit is suppressed, the mind is affected, and when the mind fails to work, everything stops or runs into error.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, once you experience pressure or weight in your spirit, it is very important for you to immediately deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You must never allow this condition to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you allow it to continue, you will suffer, and the weight will become heavier and heavier.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do not try to remove it, you will become accustomed to it after a period of time and not try to remove it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Subconsciously this weight will become part of your life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You will find that all spiritual things appear burdensome, and you will find it hard to go on in the spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you do not deal with such weight the first time, it will come back more easily the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The way to deal with it is to immediately stop what you are doing and take care of the demand of the spiritual senses.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should immediately reject this weight with your will and refuse it through the exercise of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes you have to speak a word to oppose this weight.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes you have to reject it in prayer by the exercise of spiritual strength.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you do this, the evil spirits will not be able to weigh down your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, another necessary step is to remove the cause of this weight.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the cause is not removed, the weight will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, while you are rejecting the work of the enemy, you should, at the same time, reject the cause of the enemy's work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If you do this, you will claim back the ground that you have given to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you have the power of discernment, you will see that you have failed because you did not cooperate with God at certain times and in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When this happens, the enemy gains an opportunity to oppress you with weight.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This ground must be reclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You must reject the cause of the enemy's work which comes as a result of your failures.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you do this, the enemy will flee away.</S>
