Because we stress man's need when we preach the gospel, our converts stress their gain when they accept the gospel
If we look carefully through the Bible, setting aside our own concepts, we see that the scriptural presentation is quite different from ours
It was not only John the Baptist who began his gospel preaching with the words, 'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand'
In this New Testament dispensation, when presenting the gospel to man, God presents the kingdom as its one transcendent object
The Christianity of today has made the matter of the kingdom largely a matter of prophecy, a matter related to the future
We acknowledge there is an aspect of the kingdom that is future, but the scriptural emphasis is on the present rather than the future
When someone is about to drive in a certain direction, and he sees a notice indicating one-way traffic, he does not go that way
You have heard the gospel you have believed and you have been saved but have you seen that the gospel has brought you under the rule of God
Revelation 1:5-6 reads, 'To Him Who loves us and has loosed us from our sins by His blood, and made us a kingdom'
Hitherto you have been aware of a restraint upon you, but you have not realized that there is a throne within your life
Paul said, 'The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit'
Genesis 1 does not tell us all that transpired between God and man when man was created, so Genesis 2 supplements the record
The man who is to govern the earth for God is not merely one who wields authority; he is one who wields authority as God's representative
As soon as Genesis 1 has presented a man in the divine likeness and in the exercise of divine authority, Genesis 2 presents the tree of life
In the final two chapters of Revelation you see life issuing from the throne and the throne represents authority
To use the Old Testament illustration, the Adam of Genesis 1 with his earthly life must receive the heavenly life of Genesis 2
Our Lord told Nicodemus he needed to receive the life of God so that he might become a partaker in the kingdom of God
We have no strength when it comes to submitting to God, but we have lots of strength when it comes to rebelling against Him
If we suppress the divine life within us and do not let it submit to the divine authority, then we suffer as a caged bird suffers
It also presents the precious blood to cleanse from defilement and the life to supply the power which makes us partakers in the kingdom
From the throne He requires that we be subject to Him, and from within He supplies the life that can be subject to Him
In the Old Testament the law made its demands on man, but in the New Testament it is the kingdom that makes its demands
The demands of the law proved how utterly impotent man was; now the demands of the kingdom prove, not how unable man is, but how able God is
There is no need for the demands of the kingdom to prove man's inability, for that has been conclusively proved by the demands of the law
If we do not let Him set up His throne in our lives and assert His authority over us, His life cannot operate in us
You are always hoping God will confine Himself to the throne in heaven while you occupy the throne in your life
There will be no need then to pray about your weaknesses, for if He has His place on the throne of your life every foe will be vanquished
Their enemies took the holy city, destroyed the temple, carried off the ark, and took God's own people captive
If you try to restrict God to the throne in heaven and refuse Him the throne in your life, all your cries for help will avail nothing
Let us bear in mind that the first mention of the church is in Matthew 16, and Matthew is the book that proclaims the kingdom
That is only one half of the New Testament revelation; the other half is this the church brings in the kingdom
The church which comes into being under the rule of heaven, by reason of her submission to the heavenly rule, deals with God's enemy
It is also a city, which speaks of government, and in this center of government there is the throne of God and of the Lamb
The Scriptures present this far more profound aspect that the church has been secured through the sovereign rule of heaven
Because the kingdom of heaven is able to assert its authority over a company of men, that company of men can be built up into a church
God's purpose was to bring His heavenly dominion to the earth, and apart from the church, His goal could not be attained
He needed a people who would subject themselves to the dominion of heaven so that under that dominion they might be built up into the church
Brothers and sisters, do not take for granted that if a thousand brothers and sisters come together here, it means that the church is here
They are certainly church material, but whether they are the church or not depends on whether or not they have been built together
Unfortunately, while the word 'built,' as used in Matthew 16, is found very often in the New Testament, it is frequently rendered 'edify'
The stone has to be chipped and chipped and chipped until the shape of the stone and the space in the building perfectly correspond
There are lots of stones that have been wrought upon until they are very beautiful, but where is the building?
Our Savior has been exalted to be Head of the universe, and all authority has been given Him in heaven and on earth
Even our humility, even our love, and even many of our other good qualities, are not necessarily a growing up under His headship
Where there is truly a growing up in all things into the Head, there will follow the building up of the Body as these two verses show
The extent to which the church is built up in our midst will depend entirely upon the place given in our midst to the church's Head
It happens as each member submits to the Head; it happens as each accepts the government of the kingdom of heaven
The New Testament clearly reveals that in this universe God has focused all His activities on a building project
By the first creation they have received created life; by the second creation they have received uncreated life
By the first creation they have become possessors of a human nature; by the second creation they have become possessors of a divine nature
Not only has man become possessed of two dispositions, the human and the divine, but God Himself has taken up His abode in man
He is still man, truly man but into his inner being has come the heavenly nature, for the God of heaven has come to dwell within him
Though there was satanic interference, God did not suspend His activity, but brought in redemption that the work might continue
He is now working to make them one corporate whole, so that in and through them He may manifest Himself in all His glory
Let us bring our consideration of this so lofty theme right down to everyday life and consider it in its practical aspect
The building up of the church has its beginning here the bringing of people under the sway of Christ who formerly had been under Satans sway
Oh, that you might realize that as soon as the question of church building arises, the question of the headship of Christ arises!
If in any person, or in any company of believers, Christ is able to assert His authority, then He starts to build His church
If the mass of material that went into the building of a meeting hall were torn down until it all lay in a heap what would be the good of it
The need is not for the establishing of Christian groups, but for the building up of the church under the government of the church's Head
They decide to preach the gospel together, and soon a score of people are saved twelve from the north and eight from the south
In the book of Judges we read: 'In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes'
If those two had both come into subjection to the church's Head, their problems would have been solved, for authority quells all rebellion
When we are willing to be broken under His authority, something tremendous happens a building process begins to take place
A constant acceptance of the discipline of His government makes way for the flow of His life, and so the building work goes on apace
It is not enough that we preach the gospel, bring people to a knowledge of salvation, and to a measure of spirituality
