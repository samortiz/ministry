JEREMIAH THE PROPHET'S INTERCESSION</H2><P>In 14:7&#151;15:9 we have Jeremiah the prophet's intercession.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. His Intercession</H2><P>In his intercession Jeremiah confesses that they have sinned against Jehovah. Their iniquities testify against them, and their apostasies have become many. Nevertheless, he prays that Jehovah will act for His name's sake (14:7). Then Jeremiah continues his intercession, saying, "O Hope of Israel, / Its Savior in a time of distress, / Why should You be like a sojourner in the land, / Like a traveler who turns aside to lodge for the night? / Why should You be like an astonished man, / Like a mighty man who is unable to save? / Yet You are in our midst, O Jehovah, / And we are called by Your name; / Do not leave us" (vv. 8-9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Jehovah's Refusal</H2><P>Jeremiah interceded for Israel, but Jehovah refused to listen to the prophet's intercession. Instead of accepting the people, He said that He would remember their iniquity and punish their sins (v. 10). Then Jehovah went on to say to Jeremiah, "Do not pray for the welfare of this people. When they fast, I will not listen to their ringing cry; when they offer up a burnt offering and a meal offering, I will not accept them; but by sword and by famine and by pestilence I will consume them" (vv. 11-12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Prophet's Prayer<br>concerning the False Prophets,<br>and Jehovah's Answer</H2><P>In verse 13 the prophet prayed concerning the false prophets, saying, "Ah, Lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets say to them, You will not see sword, nor will you have famine, for I will give you assured peace in this place." In His answer to Jeremiah's prayer, Jehovah said that the prophets prophesied falsehood in His name, that they prophesied a false vision, that they themselves would be consumed by sword and by famine, and the people to whom they prophesied would be cast out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword (vv. 14-16).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Jeremiah and Lamentations &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
