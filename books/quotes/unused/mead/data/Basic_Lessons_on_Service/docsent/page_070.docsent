   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE DANGER: A. Beating Our Fellow Slaves</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Mistreating Fellow Believers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 24 speaks of the evil slave who "says in his heart, My master delays, and begins to beat his fellow slaves..." vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>48-49a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we mistreat a fellow believer by criticizing, opposing, or despising him, that is to beat him in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to say a strong word here.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can easily fall into this danger without any kind of realization.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can fall into criticizing the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes we may oppose or despise some of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps we would even fight against them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is to beat the Lord's slaves, who are our fellow slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. Eating and Drinking with the Drunken</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Keeping Company with People</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Who Are Drunken with Worldly Things</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 24:49b says that this evil slave "eats and drinks with the drunken."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's word in Matthew 24 is a parable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since it is a parable, it must be interpreted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To eat and drink with the drunken is to keep company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are drunk with their worldly enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the danger of not using our gift.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once we become a person who keeps company with worldly people, we would not be faithful to the Lord in using the gift He gives us, so we fall into danger.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>C. Hiding Our Gift in the Earth 1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being Passive, Not Active,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>for the Lord's Service</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Matthew 25:25 the slothful slave said to his master, "I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To be afraid is negative.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should, rather, be positive and aggressive in using the Lord's gift.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To go off and hide the Lord's talent in the earth is too passive.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should be active in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we hide our gift, we do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be passive and not active for the Lord's service means we are hiding our gift and not using it.</S>
