Walking by the Spirit as the Rule</H2><P>[If we consider Galatians 5:25 in light of the other verses where the Greek word stoicheo is used for walk (Rom. 4:12; Phil. 3:16), we shall see that to walk by the Spirit is to walk by the Spirit as our rule. The Spirit Himself is the way, the rule, the line, the principle, leading toward God's goal. The Spirit Himself should be our rule. If we would have the second walk by the Spirit, we must take the Spirit as our rule, our way. This may be illustrated by driving on the highway to reach a specific destination, which is different from merely driving around. When we drive on the highway, the lanes on the highway are a rule. Driving according to this rule, we are able to reach our destination.</P><P>In our Christian walk, the second kind of walk by the Spirit is a walk in which the Spirit is the rule. Our rule should not be doctrine or theology. Furthermore, it should not be the law. Paul's intention in writing to the Galatians was to tell them that they should no longer take the law as their rule. The Galatian believers had been distracted from the Spirit to the law and had taken it as their rule. Paul told them that they were foolish and that they should return to the Spirit as their rule. Since they had life and lived by the Spirit, they should also walk by the Spirit as their rule. If we would have the second walk for the fulfillment of God's purpose, we must first learn to walk by the Spirit as our way, rule, principle, and lane.</P><P>I encourage all the saints to have the second walk by the Spirit. You need to pray, "Lord, I will follow You to have the second walk by the Spirit for the fulfillment of Your purpose. I do not want to walk by doctrine, theology, organization, or natural concepts. I want to walk by the Spirit as my unique highway."</P><P>According to 5:25, since we have received life and live by the Spirit, we should now have the second walk by the Spirit as our rule. We have been given life by the Spirit that we may walk by the Spirit to fulfill God's purpose. What a glorious goal lies before us! The highway which leads us to this goal is the Spirit, the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God. As we walk on this unique highway, we should neither swerve nor turn around, but move on directly to the goal.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SUMMARY</H2><P>The Lord's ultimate charge is that we live, act, and have our being according to the spirit. We are led by the Spirit by walking according to the inward sense of the divine life. Two kinds of walk by the spirit are mentioned in Galatians 5. The first walk is a general daily walk displaying such virtues as love, joy and peace. The second walk is according to certain elementary rules and principles for the fulfillment of God's purpose. We should live by the Spirit and have the second walk by the Spirit as our rule.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>QUESTIONS</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>When we say "walk according to spirit," what do we mean by the word "walk"?</li><li>How does the inner sense of life help us walk by the spirit?</li><li>What verses in Galatians show us the two walks by the spirit?</li><li>Define the Greek words "peripateo" and "stoicheo."</li><li>Explain the difference between the two walks in Galatians 5.</li></ol><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Quoted Portions from (Lee/LSM) Publications</H2><ol class="decimal"><li>Life Messages, pp. 431-432.</li><li>Our Human Spirit, p. 38.</li><li>Life Messages, p. 432.</li><li>Life-study of Romans, pp. 215, 222-223.</li><li>Life-study of Galatians, pp. 333-334, 375, 349-350.</li></ol><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> </body></html>
