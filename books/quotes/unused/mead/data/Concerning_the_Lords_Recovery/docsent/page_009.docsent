   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MADE ACCORDING TO GOD'S IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Man was made by God with a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is a purposeful and thoughtful God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to His purpose He made a plan to create the universe and to create man in the universe to express Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 1:26 and 27 occupy a strong place in the Bible, telling us that when God was going to make man it seemed that the Triune God held a conference.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 26 says let "us" make man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible does not record a kind of conference among the Godhead before the creation of the heavens and the earth or the vegetable and animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But before God made man there was a kind of conference among the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The decision was made to create man in their own image and after their own likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all have to respect ourselves because we are made after God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Genesis 1 the vegetables bring forth after their kind, and the animals bring forth after their kind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But mankind is after God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our image and our likeness is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Don't think that this means we are God!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is like a photograph.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you take a photograph of me you may say that that picture is me, and you also may say that that picture is not me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both are right.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That photograph is not the real person.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every human being is a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God only took one photograph, but through the generations there has been a marvelous reproduction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There have been millions of copies made.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all are pictures of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A photograph, though, is just a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It has no content and no life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So in the second chapter of the Bible, after man was created in the image of God, God brought him to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a strong indication that the man created by God did not have the divine life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So God brought him to the tree of life, indicating that God wanted him to take the tree of life in order to receive the divine life of God into himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At the beginning of the Bible there is a man made not only by God but also according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God made a duplicate of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But this is only in the outward appearance, without the inward content.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the beginning of the Bible there is such an expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man was made for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not express ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should express God because we were made in God's image and after God's likeness.</S>
