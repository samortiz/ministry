   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION FIVE THE ANALYSIS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE INTUITION, THE FELLOWSHIP, AND THE CONSCIENCE CHAPTER ONE THE INTUITION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we want to understand more clearly about spiritual life, we have to analyze the spirit thoroughly and understand all of its laws.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only after we have understood every function of the spirit can we comprehend the laws by which the spirit operates.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Once we know the laws of the spirit, we will learn how to follow the spirit, that is, to walk by the laws of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These are vital to our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not afraid of having too much knowledge concerning the spirit; our only concern is that we pursue it too strenuously with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The gospel of God tells people that fallen man can receive regeneration and that fleshly man can obtain a new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The new spirit is the foundation of his new life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The spiritual life we normally speak about is just a life in which one lives by the spirit he received at regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is very regrettable that most believers know very little about the functions of the spirit and the things related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may know in terminology the relationship between man and his spirit, yet they still cannot identify this spirit in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As we mentioned before, either they do not know where their spirit is, or they reckon their own feelings and thoughts as the functions of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, an analysis of the functions of the spirit is needed because only then will believers know how to follow the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have mentioned before that the functions of the spirit can be categorized into three parts: intuition, fellowship, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although these three are distinguishable, they are closely knitted together.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It would be very difficult for us to talk about one without mentioning the other two.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, when we talk about intuition, spontaneously we also include fellowship and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, even though we are analyzing the spirit, we still need to make a close study of its tripartite functions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have already seen how the spirit is categorized into intuition, fellowship, and conscience, and we will not repeat it here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, we have to consider further what the intuition, fellowship or worship , and conscience are, and what functions they have, in order to know how to walk according to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the spirit encompasses the work of intuition, fellowship, and conscience, we can say that walking according to the spirit is just walking according to one's intuition, fellowship, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Intuition, fellowship, and conscience are just three functions of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not saying that the spirit includes only these three, neither are we saying that the spirit is just one of these three.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the Bible, these are simply the three major functions of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spirit is still the spirit; it is substantial, personal, and invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is impossible for us to apprehend the inner essence of the spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can only realize what it is by the functions it manifests.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are not here to learn the wonderful mysteries of the future but to pursue a spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as we know the functions of the spirit and how to walk according to the spirit, it will be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our spirit is not material, yet it can exist independently in our body as the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, although our spirit is not physical, it must possess its own "spiritual substance."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Otherwise, it would be impossible for it to exist independently.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This spiritual substance contains various functions which execute all the requirements that God has towards man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, we will only try to learn the functions of the spirit, not the substance of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man is like the holy temple, and our spirit is like the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Going one step further, we can compare the intuition, fellowship, and conscience to the ark in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>1 God's law was in the ark to instruct the Israelites in what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God revealed Himself and His will through the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Similarly, God is making Himself and His will known to the believers through their intuition so that they can follow accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2 Upon the ark was the propitiatory cover with the blood sprinkled on its cover.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was the place where God manifested His glory and received man's worship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Similarly, every one who has been redeemed by the precious blood has his spirit regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In this spirit he worships God and fellowships with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God could only fellowship with the Israelites over the propitiatory cover of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Similarly, He can only fellowship with the believers in their blood-cleansed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3 According to the original language, the ark is the "ark of testimony," and the Ten Commandments within it served as the testimony of God to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If they did well, the two tablets in the ark would approve them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If they did things improperly, the Ten Commandments would accuse them silently from within the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Similarly, the Holy Spirit has written God's law in our conscience so that it bears witness to our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It bears witness to those things that are according to God's will and condemns those things that are not according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"My conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit" Rom 9:1</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Look how the children of Israel honored the ark!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When they crossed the Jordan River, they had no other guidance except the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They simply followed the ark without any doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When they fought against Jericho, they did nothing other than follow the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When they could not stand against the Philistines, they tried to utilize the ark according to their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Was not Uzzah immediately killed when he tried to hold the ark with his fleshly hands?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How they rejoiced after they had prepared a place for the ark!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Psa 132 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These things ought to teach believers how to deal with the ark, which is the intuition, fellowship, and conscience in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is life and peace when we follow these functions, and there will be nothing but complete failure if we try to interfere with them according to our fleshly will.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Victory did not depend on what the Israelites thought but on where the ark was leading.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Any spiritual usefulness depends not on our thought but on the teaching of the intuition, fellowship, and conscience.</S>
