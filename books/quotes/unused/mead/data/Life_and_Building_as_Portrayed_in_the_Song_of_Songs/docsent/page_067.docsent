   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A METABOLIC CHANGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we mean business in taking Jesus into us in this way, we will experience a real change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We know that eating really changes people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more we eat, the more we are changed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the new elements enter into us, they replace the old.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During a period of one hundred and twenty days, all our blood cells are replaced with new cells.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we were to keep the old cells for a period of time, we would die.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Of course such a thing is not possible physically, but I do believe that it is possible spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we still hold on to the old things, nothing will be replaced within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We do need this metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When a new, nourishing element of Jesus gets into us, it carries away the old element and replaces it with something new.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the transforming work of Jesus which results from taking Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of metabolic change regulates us, but not in an outward way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is an inward regulation through the replacing of the old with the new.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If some of us are living together as roommates, there will be many opportunities for this inward regulation and change to work.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may feel that a certain brother is quite undesirable, but if we would take some new element of Jesus into us, we would have a completely different feeling about that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will begin to feel that we really need him for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE HUMANITY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I was a young Christian, I was taught the verses in Ephesians 4:2-3: "With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love; endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lowliness, meekness, and long-suffering were really a suffering to me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more I tried to be lowly, the more high-minded I was.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And the more I tried to be meek, the more unyielding I was.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I believe that we all have had these experiences of trying to be lowly, meek, and long-suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These are not vain words in the Bible; they are really meaningful, but we must realize that they are the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lowliness really is not lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lowliness is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As for meekness, it cannot be found in the whole universe outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Meekness is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ never meant for us to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must experience Christ as our meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is easy to understand these verses in Ephesians in a natural way even a child can read and understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But these two verses are the most difficult verses for Christians to realize.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we seek lowliness, the more lowliness flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually we simply will not believe that there is such a thing as lowliness in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible speaks about it, but we simply cannot find it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Bible speaks also of long-suffering, which really means long endurance, but where is it?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we attempt to endure, the shorter our endurance is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we try to be patient, patience flies away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We come to the conclusion that the dictionaries are propagating lies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They explain what these things are, but there are no such things to be found.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord that by His grace we have begun to know a little bit about patience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Patience is just Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Long-suffering or long endurance, which some versions render as making allowances for others, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no such thing as making allowances for others without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we have the proper experience of Christ, we will understand what these verses mean.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the virtues of the proper humanity are just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is our lowliness, and Christ is our meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Some may say that they are full of meekness, but their kind of meekness could only last for three or four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then it will vanish away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Philippians 2:2-3 says, "Fulfill ye my joy, that ye be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These verses sound so desirable that we might be tempted to fulfill them ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But we must be clear that these verses do not describe any human virtue besides Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All these virtues are the attributes of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His humanity is the summation of all human virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is by His humanity that we are built up.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can never be built up by our own attributes or our own human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can only be built up by the experience of Christ as all of these human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every item is a part of the expression of Christ and will last for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The meekness which is Jesus can never be exhausted!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The more we test it, the more it lasts.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It can stand any kind of test.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is what we need for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All these virtues are simply the expression of our inner growth of Christ.</S>
