<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In the Following Conditions</H2><P>Revelation 2 and 3 reveal that we need to conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy in certain conditions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Loving the Lord with the First Love</H2><P>We need to be those who love the Lord with the first love (Rev. 2:4). The first love may be compared to the love of newlyweds. After a couple has been married for a period of time, it is easy for the first love to fade away. What wife loves her husband now as much as she did on her wedding day? We must recover the wedding, bridal love toward our Husband, Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Enjoying Eating Christ as the Tree of Life<br>in the Church as Today's Paradise<br>to Be a Shining Lampstand</H2><P>We also need to enjoy eating Christ as the tree of life in the church as today's Paradise so that we can be a shining lampstand (Rev. 2:7, 5). The Lord does not say that He will give the overcomers to eat of the fruit of the tree of life. He tells the overcomers that He will give them to eat of the entire tree of life, which is Christ Himself. We should eat one tree, the universal tree, the unique tree, that is, the tree of life, which is Christ as the embodiment of the divine life.</P><P>We have to love the Lord with a bridal love, and we have to enjoy Him as the entire tree of life. This tree is growing in the Paradise of God. The Paradise of God (v. 7) is the New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom. The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom will be a paradise to God. This paradise will be much more pleasant than the garden of Eden. Today the church life is the precursor of this coming paradise, the miniature of the New Jerusalem in the coming kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Being Faithful unto Death<br>in Suffering Poverty and Trial<br>for the Crown of Life</H2><P>The Lord exhorted the church in Smyrna to be faithful unto death in suffering poverty and trial for the crown of life (Rev. 2:9-10). A crown in New Testament usage always denotes a prize that is in addition to salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Enjoying Christ as the Hidden Manna<br>to Overcome the Worldliness<br>of the Degraded Church</H2><P>We have to enjoy Christ as the hidden manna, a special portion of the nourishing supply, to overcome the worldliness of the degraded church with the idolatrous teaching of Balaam and the hierarchical teaching of the Nicolaitans (Rev. 2:12-17a). The Lord gave manna to the children of Israel openly. Every morning around their camp the manna was there in an open way for them to eat (Exo. 16:14-18). But a small portion of this manna was preserved in a golden pot within the ark in the tabernacle (16:33; Heb. 9:4). That is the hidden manna. The open manna is Christ as the common portion to all of God's people for them to enjoy in a public way. The hidden manna, signifying the hidden Christ, is a special portion reserved for His overcoming seekers, who overcome the degradation of the worldly church.</P><P>Only the overcoming seekers who enter into the Holy of Holies to experience Christ as the ark, God's testimony, enjoy a particular portion of the hidden Christ. We must have some deeper experience of Christ. Our experience of Christ should not merely be openly in the meetings, but hiddenly in the Holy of Holies, even in Christ Himself as the ark, the testimony of God. In Christ as the ark, we can enjoy Him as the hidden manna, as a particular portion for our life supply, to overcome the worldliness of the degraded church.</P><P>Such a worldly church has the idolatrous teaching of Balaam and the hierarchical teaching of the Nicolaitans. Today in Christendom these two kinds of teachings are prevailing. Balaam was a Gentile prophet who taught people for wages. He was a prophet for hire, and his teaching enticed God's people into fornication and idolatry (Num. 25:1-3; 31:16). The teaching of Balaam distracts believers from the person of Christ to idolatry and from the enjoyment of Christ to spiritual fornication.</P><P>The teaching of the Nicolaitans builds up a hierarchy among the believers. This teaching destroys the function of believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord's Body as His expression. In both Roman Catholicism and the Protestant denominations, there is a hierarchical organization. In the religious organization of the Roman Catholic Church there are the bishops, the archbishops, the cardinals, and eventually the pope. In the Protestant denominations there is the system of clergy and laity. The teaching of the Nicolaitans is that only the clergy are qualified and positioned to preach, to speak for the Lord. The others are so-called laymen. This is hierarchy.</P><P>In the Lord's recovery, we have to overcome the clergy-laity system. All of us have the position as members of the Body of Christ to speak for the Lord. If someone asks us who our pastor is, we should say that everyone among us is a "pastor." All of us can speak for the Lord and teach the truth. Our speaking for the Lord in the meetings is the annulling of the hierarchy. We are the members of the organic Body of Christ, and every member has a particular function. The Lord desires to recover the functioning of all the members of the Body of Christ.</P>
