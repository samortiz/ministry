   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE COMPOUNDED NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit, as we have said, is compounded with the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is true of the Spirit is also true of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The death and resurrection of Christ are both compounded in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abiding in the Lord is according to the anointing's teaching, which is based upon your knowledge of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since the Word is mainly compounded with death and resurrection, this is the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You need knowledge concerning His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then you will find that the more you abide in Christ, the more you experience His death and participate in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This kind of abiding is the real release of the spirit, based upon the termination of everything natural.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The spirit we release should not be mixed with our natural ability, our flesh, our self, or anything else of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our spirit needs the imprint of the death of all these natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Abiding in Christ, then, is according to the working of His death and resurrection in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All your natural being, all the old creation, must be put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When you experience this killing, your abiding in Christ will be genuine and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On the positive side, you will also experience the resurrection, and your release of the spirit will be without any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A THOROUGH KILLING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To experience more of this putting to death of whatever is of your self, your flesh, and the old man, read the Word, pray, and breathe in the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If anything of the old still remains, it becomes an insulation between Christ and you, making your abiding superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abiding in Christ in a thorough way depends upon a thorough killing, carried out by the Word and executed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With this killing comes resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then whatever comes forth from you will be from a crystal pure spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Herein is the way for the living, growing, and producing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will make us shining lights individually Phil 2:15 and a shining lampstand collectively Rev 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord will be expressed and God's economy fulfilled.</S>
