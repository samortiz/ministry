OVER THE SCRIPTURES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Giving Priority to Prayer<br />
rather than to Exposition and Study</h2>
<p>Now we must speak concerning the practical exercise of coming to the Scriptures in prayer. When we come to the Scriptures, rather than giving priority to expounding or studying the Scriptures, we should pray using the words of the Scriptures in order to open up the Bible. This kind of reading does not emphasize studying or even discussion and fellowship. Rather, it emphasizes the absorption of the spiritual content of the Scriptures. With this kind of reading, exposition and discussion is not critical.</p>
<p>If there is a sense while we are reading that some point should be expressed, it is best to express it through prayer. For example, if four brothers are reading the Bible together, a brother who has a certain sense about a verse should express it through prayer. When he prays in this way, another brother may receive some inspiration, which he, in turn, can express through prayer. In this way the meaning of a portion of the Bible will become even clearer than if he tried to express the meaning through explanatory words. We will also gain more than a mental understanding of the Word; instead, the words that we read will become a supply in our spirit. When we read the Word, we should emphasize prayer much more than just explanation and discussion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Praying over Too Many Verses</h2>
<p>Second, when we use the Scriptures to pray, we should not use too many verses. It is difficult to absorb many verses. This is like trying to eat a meal when there is too much food on the table; it is easy to be distracted by the choices, and it also causes those who are eating to not fully taste or appreciate the food. It also encourages one to take big bites or to eat too quickly so that the food is not digested properly. The amount of food is not important; rather, eating in the proper way is important. Likewise, when we pray over the Bible, there are certain skills that we need to learn. Sometimes we may need to read through an entire section of verses and then pray over a few verses within the section. For example, if we read only two or three verses of the genealogy in Matthew 1, we may feel very dry. It would be better to read through the entire genealogy and then select a small section to pray over. This requires discernment, because in other sections the verses are so rich that it is enough to read and pray over just one verse.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pointing Out the Crucial Points</h2>
<p>It is best if a serving one can give a little explanation of the verses that the young people will pray over. This is not a matter of giving a long exposition or message; a brief point or two will be sufficient. For example, if the selected verse is John 1:1, it is enough to point out that the Word was in the beginning, that the Word is the Lord Himself, and that all things came into being through the Lord as the Word. We can also point out that in the Lord is life and that this life is the light that shines in us. It is sufficient to point out these crucial points.</p>
<p>Concerning the genealogy in Matthew 1, we can point out that the Lord Jesus is the son of David and the son of Abraham and that there are forty-two generations from Abraham to Christ in the genealogy. The first section is from Abraham to David, the next section is the genealogy of the kings from David until the time of captivity, and the last section is of the forefathers who lost the kingdom from the time of captivity until Mary&rsquo;s husband, Joseph. Perhaps the serving one can point out that this genealogy mentions five women. Among them, only Mary was a chaste virgin, while the other four were not so good. These four were Tamar, the daughter-in-law of Judah; Rahab, the wife of Salmon; Ruth, the wife of Boaz; and Bathsheba, whom David married and who had been the wife of Uriah the Hittite. We can also point out the reason that the Lord Jesus is called the son of Abraham and the son of David. Abraham is the father of faith, whereas David is the beginning of the generations of the kings. On one hand, the Lord Jesus is the son of Abraham, typified by Isaac; on the other hand, He is the son of David, typified by Solomon. In short, the entire genealogy shows that the Lord Jesus is God coming to be a descendant of man. Furthermore, He is the One who receives the inheritance as well as inherits the throne. The son of Abraham receives the inheritance, whereas the son of David inherits the throne. It is good enough if these crucial points are mentioned briefly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Leading the Young People to Pray</h2>
<p>We must lead the young people to pray. In the past when we asked them to pray, they would say that they did not know what words to pray or that they did not have any feeling to pray. Now that we are practicing praying the Word, there are no excuses because they do not have to compose any prayer. Instead, they can simply pray according to the words in the Bible. For example, using John 1:1, someone can pray, &ldquo;Lord, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; He can use the verse as his prayer, or he can change the wording a little. The excuse of having no feeling to pray has also been solved because as soon as we pray with the words from the Bible, we are full of feeling. We can say, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was You.&rdquo; Sometimes when we just read the Bible, we may not have any feeling, but when we pray using the Scriptures, we receive a supply in our spirit. When we pray according to the words in the Bible, there are words in our spirit that are full of feeling. Thus, it is easy to pray, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Word of God. You explain God to us, and You also speak to us from within all the time.&rdquo; This kind of spontaneous speaking to the Lord is not difficult at all.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Praying over Too Many Points</h2>
<p>When we lead people to pray, we should teach them not to pray over too many points. Each person should pray one point. Occasionally, someone may pray concerning two points but no more than what is needed. No one should attempt to cover all the points in his prayer. For example, John 1:1-4 has several crucial points: &ldquo;in the beginning was the Word,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Word was with God,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Word was God,&rdquo; &ldquo;all things came into being through Him,&rdquo; &ldquo;in Him was life,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the life was the light of men.&rdquo; A person does not need to cover all these points in one prayer. It is best to pray over one point or, at most, two points. We should cover one point in our prayer and then let others have the opportunity to pray. When we all pray one point, all the points will be covered by all the saints. However, if someone still has some feeling, he can pray again.</p>
<p>When we take turns to pray in this way, our spirit will have instant feeling. Some feelings may come directly, and other feelings may come from hearing the prayers of the other saints. Some feelings arise out of a sense of mutual inspiration. As a result of such prayers, a portion of the Bible will be thoroughly opened and imparted into the young people. Furthermore, all the young people will be exercised in their spirit and supplied with spiritual food. This kind of supply from the Bible contains Christ Himself. We must explain these matters to the young people and lead them into this practical exercise.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> </body></html>
