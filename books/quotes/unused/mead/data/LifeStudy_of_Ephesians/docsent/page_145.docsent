   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WALKING AS CHILDREN OF LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 8 Paul says, For you were once darkness, but now light in the Lord; walk as children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We were once not only dark, but darkness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we are not only the children of light, but light itself Matt 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As light is God, so darkness is the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We were darkness because we were one with the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we are light because we are one with God in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this verse Paul exhorts us to walk as children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As God is light, so we, the children of God, are also the children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because we are now light in the Lord, we should walk as children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 2 Paul tells us to walk in love, and in verse 8 he tells us to walk as children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first seven verses of this chapter cover the matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we walk in love, we shall keep ourselves from uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To walk in love is to walk in intimacy with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An intimate relationship between a daughter and mother may illustrate what it means to walk in love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Certain young women enjoy an intimate love with their mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They love whatever their mothers love.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of the love they have for their mothers, they are not willing to do anything opposed to their mothers feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, they walk in intimate love toward their mothers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same principle, we have an intimate relationship with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As those who have received grace, we may come in the Son to contact the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Father s presence we not only enjoy grace, the expression of love, but we also enjoy love itself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We experience this love in a very intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we enjoy the love of God in such an intimate way, we do not want to do anything that displeases the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Father hates fornication, uncleanness, and lust.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we walk in love, we shall stay away from such things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we love the Father, we shall not do anything to grieve His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a tender, delicate walk this is!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not simply living by grace; it is walking in love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should always remember that we are children of God enjoying His love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are saints separated unto Him and saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, in our daily walk we would always take care of the Father s feeling, for we live intimately in His tender love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The difference between love and grace can be illustrated by the relationship between a mother and her child.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes a child may want something from the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, at other times the child simply wants to enjoy the mother s loving embrace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Receiving something from the mother which expresses the mother s love is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But resting in the loving embrace of the mother is an illustration of love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same principle, we have received grace, the expression of the Father s love.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But as we go to the Father in fellowship, we enter into His love, which is the source of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is rather difficult to point out the difference between truth and light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our experience we may often realize God as truth to us, as our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But sometimes when we get into God s presence, we sense that we are in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At such times, we are not only experiencing reality, but we are in the very light itself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Thus, the experience of light is deeper than the experience of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not simply be according to truth and by grace, but in love and under light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Walking in love and in light is deeper and more tender than living according to truth and by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After commanding us to walk as children of light, Paul inserts in verse 9 a parenthetical statement regarding the fruit of the light, saying that the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light; righteousness is the way or the procedure to produce the fruit of the light; and the truth is the reality, the real expression of the fruit of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This expression is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The fruit of the light must be good in nature, righteous in procedure, and real in expression so that God may be expressed as the reality of our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is significant that in speaking of the fruit of the light Paul mentions only three things: goodness, righteousness, and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He does not speak of holiness, kindness, or humility.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The reason he mentions just three things is that the fruit of the light in goodness, righteousness, and truth is related to the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Goodness refers to the nature of the fruit of light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord Jesus once indicated that the only One who is good is God Himself Matt 19:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, goodness here denotes God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God the Father as goodness is the nature of the fruit of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Notice that here Paul speaks not of the work of the light nor of the conduct of the light, but of the fruit of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Fruit is a matter of life with its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The nature of the fruit of the light is God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have pointed out that the righteousness denotes the way or the procedure of the fruit of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Righteousness is the procedure by which the fruit of the light is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Godhead, the Son, Christ, is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He came to earth to produce certain things according to God s procedure, which is always righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Righteousness is God s way, God s procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ came to accomplish God s purpose according to His righteous procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, the second aspect of the fruit of the light refers to God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The truth is the expression of the fruit of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This fruit must be real; that is, it must be the expression of God, the shining of the hidden light.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>No doubt, this truth refers to the Spirit of reality, the third of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, the Father as the goodness, the Son as the righteousness, and the Spirit as the truth, the reality, are all related to the fruit of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 9 is the definition of walking as children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we walk as the children of light, we shall bear the fruit described in verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The fruit we bear by walking as the children of the light must be in goodness, in righteousness, and in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The proof that we are walking as children of light is seen in the bearing of such fruit.</S>
