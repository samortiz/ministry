   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SUDDEN FEELINGS REQUIRING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WAITING AND OBSERVING, AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>SUSTAINED FEELING BEING MORE RELIABLE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sudden feelings within us are not reliable and require waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You may have a sudden thought during your prayer that you can surely perform a miracle, that you can pray for and lay hands on a certain sick one and he will be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Or the thought may come that tonight when you go out to knock on doors, in the first house you visit the whole household will be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These kinds of sudden thoughts can be frequent and can come to you during prayer, while you sleep, or during the day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some Christians are not clear about these situations and are manipulated by these sudden thoughts, doing things without consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such thought is not of God, but of the evil one, who tempts people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He tried to tempt the Lord Jesus to turn stones into bread and to jump from the top of the temple Matt 4:3-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We who live in the spirit should follow the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we do, we will not trust in the sudden feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These sudden feelings are usually from the imaginations of the flesh or from the fiery darts of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we should wait and observe these sudden feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The real feeling of the spirit is surely lasting, and only the lasting feeling can be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TO FOLLOW THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>BEING TO OBEY THE ANOINTING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only does the feeling of the spirit come from the operation of the law of life; actually the feeling of the spirit is the anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit Himself is an ointment which anoints us within.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This anointing produces the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we obey the anointing of the Spirit, we are following the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we follow the feeling of the spirit, we are walking according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IDLE BABBLING, MURMURING,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>AND CONTENTIOUS WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>NULLIFYING THE FEELING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>James 3:2 says, If anyone does not stumble in word, this is a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, Proverbs 10:19 says, In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses show us how important our talk is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Idle words, babbling, murmuring, and reasonings will annul the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the Apostle Paul says, Do all things without murmurings and reasonings Phil 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Murmurings are from the emotions, and reasonings are from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Generally speaking, murmurings are more with the sisters, and reasonings are more with the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether from the emotions or from the mind, they are from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When a person is not living in the spirit, he is living in the soul and will murmur and reason.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church life, if we want to nullify all these negative things, we have to follow the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I wish that there would be no murmurings and reasonings among us, but only the feeling of the spirit and our following of the feeling of the spirit.</S>
