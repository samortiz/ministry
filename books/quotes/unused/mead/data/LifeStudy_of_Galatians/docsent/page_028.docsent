   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING IN THE ORGANIC UNION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:19 Paul says, For I through law have died to law that I might live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The law requires me, a sinner, to die, and according to that requirement Christ died for me and with me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, I have died in Christ and with Christ through the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the obligation under the law, the relationship to the law, has been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To live to God means to be obligated to God in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In Christ s death we are through with the law, and in His resurrection we are responsible to God in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have become dead to the law so that we may live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as we still hold to any kind of law, whether the Mosaic law or our self-made law, we cannot live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when we are cut off from the law by means of the organic union with Christ, we spontaneously live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be dead to law means that we have been discharged from the law in which we were held.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Romans 7:6 says, But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Having been liberated from obligation to the law, we may now walk in newness of life Rom 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, walking in newness of life depends upon the cutting we experience in the organic union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we experience the cutting, the more we live to God and walk in newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we have died to law, we are no longer obligated to keep the law by the striving of the flesh Gal 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we have a certain self-made law, we always strive to keep it by the strength of the flesh, not by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be living unto God is to be obligated to God in the divine life, to be responsible to God in the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the organic union with Christ, we experience resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this resurrection life we are held to God spontaneously and are obligated to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This also depends on the organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer we who live, but Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We no longer live in the old man, the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in resurrection we live in the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To live in the faith of the Son of God means to live in the organic union with the Son of God which comes through our believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We live to God with Christ Rom 6:8, 10 and through the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the enjoyment of the processed Triune God in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This experience depends on our appreciation of the loveliness and preciousness of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PRESENTING CHRIST IN HIS LOVELINESS</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In principle, in preaching the gospel we should be like the top salesmen, who are able to present something precious in a way that others will appreciate it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need the proper salesmanship.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus is infinitely precious, but our presentation of Him is not always adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since we do not know how to present the loveliness of the Lord Jesus in a proper way, it is difficult for those who listen to our gospel preaching to have faith in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if we present Him adequately, others will be infused with His preciousness, and they will spontaneously appreciate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This appreciation will become their faith which will operate in them to unite them with the Lord Jesus organically.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here in this organic union we are dead to the law and alive to God.</S>
