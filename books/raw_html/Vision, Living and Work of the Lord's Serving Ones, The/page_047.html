	 <h2 class="head1">LAYING THE FOUNDATION OF MAINTAINING<br />
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHERS</h2>
<p>In the coordination we should not have the thought that if one place does not suit us, we can move to another place. If we leave, we should not expect our work to be blessed by the Lord or that our conscience will be clear. Instead, our conscience will not be sensitive to the Lord. Moreover, it will be easy to regard a new place as our domain. Furthermore, as a result of fellowship and communication among the churches, the saints in the new locality will not be supportive.</p>
<p>In another ten or twenty years the Lord will lead many among us to go abroad to other continents and work for Him. By that time, it will be very common to serve full time. Hence, we must begin now to lay a good foundation. First, we should maintain a good relationship with the unbelieving ones in our community; we should not be rude to them. Even if others in our community are pagans, we should not be rude to them. Concerning our relatives, we should conduct ourselves according to the teaching of the Bible and try our best to maintain a good relationship. Second, we should be the same in the church. We should not have a different attitude toward the saints who do not meet with us; rather, we should maintain a good relationship with them. Third, we should maintain a good relationship with the serving ones. This relationship is not only local or limited to a country; it is universal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEKING THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING<br />
FOR THE PROPAGATION</h2>
<p>Many of the full-timers among us are not novices. They have received some training and have also spent many years serving in the churches. I hope that these ones will pray and seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading concerning the propagation. Gospelizing Taiwan is not a slogan; it is the present direction of the work. There is no arrangement, no centralized authority, and no uniform practice among us. We follow life, and we allow every saint to be led by the Spirit. It is best for two brothers and perhaps one sister to go together. With regard to their livelihood, we have fellowshipped that the full-timers should be supported; that is, their daily necessities should be taken care of by their localities. But there will be other needs related to the work. Hence, we should exercise faith and believe in God. On the one hand, the saints should pray for the co-workers who go out to labor for the Lord, and the saints should support them financially. On the other hand, those who go out should have a spirit of suffering. Yes, the church will take care of our need, but we still need to give everything to the Lord; we should learn to have faith, to pray, and to look to the Lord. The church cannot go with us, but the Lord is going with us and the prayers of the saints will go with us as well.</p>
<p>When I arrived in America in 1963, my pockets were empty and the situation was rather difficult. I still did my best to take care of the needs of the other co-workers. I would rather have suffered lack than have the other co-workers suffer. This is the kind of spirit we should have.</p>
<p>We must seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading and pray for the places that need co-workers. We should also fellowship with one another and with older co-workers. We should not wait for the church to seek the Lord on our behalf. We should seek the Lord in order to know where to go. We are the ones seeking the Lord, and we are the ones fighting the battle.</p>
<p>When we go to a new place, we must learn to establish a good fellowship with the local saints and maintain a proper relationship with them. However, we should not depend on them for everything. When I went to America, I was already sixty years old, but I had to learn to cook for myself. We must learn to take care of our practical needs and the needs of the saints. We should learn to do everything necessary to carry out our function. We should even learn to write tracts to take care of the local situation. In America some sisters worked during the day and served in the meeting hall at night. The Western missionaries who went to China served in the same way. Therefore, we should not expect others to do anything that we are unwilling to do. At present our urgent need is to pray. The kind of people we will contact when we go out and the way to contact them are the matters that will need further prayer. May the Lord lead us.</p>
