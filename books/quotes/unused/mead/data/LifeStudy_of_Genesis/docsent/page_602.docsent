   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. With the Precious Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Earth and Its Fullness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Deuteronomy 33:16 speaks of the "precious things of the earth and its fulness" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 3:21 and 22 we find a New Testament word that corresponds to this: "For all things are yours, whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to these verses, "all things" includes death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, even death, which includes all negative things, is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We, the children of God, are the blessed people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are the Josephs under God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I was young, I did a great deal of selection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For instance, I told the Lord that I wanted to be healthy, not ill, and that I did not want to suffer from certain kinds of things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I wanted to have everything that was good.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, however, the selection did not depend on me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Things did not turn out to be according to my choice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I first came into the Lord's ministry, I prayed very much and asked the Lord to give me a co-worker who was always nice, one who was neither too strong nor too weak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In my prayer I said, "Lord, You know me and You know what I need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I need a nice person, one who is neither too quick nor too slow."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But today I do not like to have any selection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes the co-worker who is not so nice in my eyes is the one who becomes the greatest blessing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same is true in married life and in family life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is difficult for me to tell anyone what kind of wife is the best wife.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I was young, I could tell you, but I cannot tell you today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps the wife who seems to be the worst will become the greatest blessing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You need to believe that all things, including a difficult wife, are blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, whether your children are nice or naughty, they are a blessing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times naughty children are a greater blessing than nice ones.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may ask the Lord for nice children, but He may give you naughty ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, even those naughty ones are a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is even a blessing to have something stolen from us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When something was stolen from me in my youth, I became angry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But today it does not matter whether you give me something or steal something from me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It does not matter whether I gain a thousand dollars or lose a thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps losing a large amount of money will be a greater blessing than receiving the same amount.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But one thing I know everything is a blessing; everything is a gain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But when I was young, I would lose my peace for several hours even over losing a handkerchief.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But if today I lost something worth a thousand dollars, I still would have the peace to sleep soundly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To suffer over the loss of something like this indicates that you are under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the worldly people lose even a small amount of money, they cannot sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we lose a large amount, we can still praise the Lord for the blessing that such a loss will bring in. As long as I am not touched by a particular loss, I am blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because we are under the blessing, no loss is truly a loss to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although we are not yet in the new heaven and the new earth, we have a foretaste of it today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need the vision to see that we are today's Joseph and that everything is a blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not like the rumors that are being spread about us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But others can testify for me that I praise the Lord because all these rumors are blessings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are a form of free advertisement.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of these rumors, my name has become famous throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I did not have to pay anything for all this advertising.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have never gone to Central America or to Africa, but my name is known there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, even the rumors are a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether or not all things are blessings does not depend on what happens; it depends on who we are.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are Joseph, everything is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But if we are Reuben, everything is a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>My burden in this message is to impress you with the fact that to us everything is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is no need to list all the items of the universal blessing in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All things are blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not a mere doctrine; it is what I have experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nothing bothers me because I realize that everything is from my Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything, good or bad, positive or negative, is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We all must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if we lose something, that loss is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul said that all things are ours, whether Paul, Peter, Apollos, life, death, or any other thing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Formerly, we were Reubens, but now we are Josephs.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as we are Josephs, whatever betide, everything is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you hate me, that is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you love me, that also is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you rob me, that is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you give me something, that also is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No matter how you treat me, with love or with hatred, what you do to me is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you do not do anything, that also is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am altogether blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because I am not a Reuben, but a Joseph, I am a blessed person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Praise the Lord that in the church we are Josephs!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Consider Joseph's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He was hated and betrayed by his brothers, and he was placed into some difficult situations.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Nevertheless, everything that happened to him was a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What his brothers did to Joseph turned out to be a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When Joseph made himself known to his brothers in Egypt, he said, "Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life" Gen 45:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Joseph also said, "Ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good" 50:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Joseph seemed to be saying, "You don't need to be afraid of me or worried about what I will do to you, for everything you did to me was a blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Everything in the universe is a blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Time, space, the heavens, the earth, the air, the things underneath the earth, all persons, all matters, and all things everything is a blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Oh, we must believe this!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the early days I held this as a mere belief.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But now I can testify with an honest heart that in my experience it is truly so.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Everything that happens to us is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In Jacob's prophecy with blessing there is a condition for blessing the first ten sons, but not with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Joseph's blessing is unconditional.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we saw this, we would simply pray, "Lord, I don't know what is good or what is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Lord, I only pray that Your will be done."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Everything depends upon whether you are a Reuben or a Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It does not depend upon the heavens, the earth, the air, or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you are a Reuben, everything will be a curse and a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But if you are a Joseph, everything will be a gain.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Nothing in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could be a loss to you.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Rather, all things will work together for good to you as long as you love the Lord Rom 8:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Even the most insignificant thing works together for your good.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Your neighbors, in-laws, and friends all work together for your good because you are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>All the New Testament believers are Josephs.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You may not feel that you are a Joseph, but the Lord says that you are.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>As long as you are a believer, you are no longer a Reuben, but a Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Because you are a Joseph, everything that happens to you is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Heaven, earth, the snow, the rain, the dew, and everything under the earth is a blessing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the reason the New Testament tells us to thank the Lord for all things Eph 5:20; 1 Thes 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I wonder whether the parents of naughty children ever thank the Lord for their naughty children.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If you have a naughty child, you must thank the Lord, saying, "Lord, how I thank You for this naughty child.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Lord, I thank You for this dissenting, rebellious child.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>What a blessing this child is to me!"</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If such a child remains a Reuben, everything will be a curse to him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>But if he believes in the Lord, he will become another Joseph, and then whatever happens to him will be a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If you read the New Testament carefully, you will see that the New Testament believers are the blessed people.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We are those under the universal blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This is why we should not curse anyone Rom 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Because everything is a blessing to us, we cannot help but bless others.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Even if others do something bad to us, that bad thing is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Hence, there is no need for us to curse them; instead of cursing, we would bless them.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We may say, "Thank you for hating me.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>God bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Your hatred is a blessing to me.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>I can bless you in any kind of situation.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>If you treat me well, I bless you.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>If you mistreat me, I still bless you."</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Praise the Lord that we are the blessed people!</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If you see this, you will realize that you are under God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>However, we often still speak in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When we gain something, we thank the Lord for His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>But when we lose something, usually we do not thank Him.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We need to see the vision that we are Josephs, that we are the blessed people, that we are under God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Whatever happens to us, good or bad, we should say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>This is a blessing."</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We often ask people, "Are you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>But now we should learn to ask them, "Are you blessed?"</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Whenever we are asked this question, we should reply, "Yes, we are blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Fundamental Christians often speak of believers as being blood-redeemed and Spirit-regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>We need to learn to say that we are the universally blessed people.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Our home, family, and all that belongs to us is a blessing, no matter how bad things may sometimes be.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>We never know what the result of a thing will be.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Today something may seem to be good, but it may turn out to be bad.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>However, a certain thing may seem very bad, but turn out to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Only the Lord knows.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Whether things are good or bad, the result is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>It does not make any difference whether our children are nice or naughty, whether our husband or wife is easy to live with or difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>To Joseph everything is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>If you see this, you will enjoy rest and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>You will say, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>We have been selected, predestinated, called, and saved, and now we are being blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>We are the blessed people, those under God's blessing, and everything is a blessing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>All things are ours.</S>
