Our Lord did not come to the earth or to the cross on His own initiative; He was anointed and set apart for the work by God
Frequently throughout the Gospel of John we find Him referring to God, not as 'God,' or 'the Father,' but as 'Him who sent Me'
If even the Son was not expected to take any initiative in God's work, is it likely that we are expected to do so?
The Lord Himself is the first Apostle because He is the first one specially sent of God; hence, the Word refers to Him as 'the Apostle'
While our Lord fulfilled His apostolic ministry on earth, He was all the time aware that His life in the flesh was limited
Even as He pursued the work committed to Him by the Father, He was preparing a group of men to continue it after His departure
Even in the new heaven and the new earth the twelve enjoy a place of particular privilege, which is assigned to no other workers for God
The apostles appointed by the Holy Spirit cannot join the ranks of those appointed by the Son; nevertheless, they are apostles
The apostles then were the personal followers of the Lord Jesus but the apostles now are ministers for the building up of the Body of Christ
When Barnabas and Paul were working in Iconium the multitude of the city was divided and some were with the Jews and some with the apostles
Broadly speaking, all believers are responsible for the work of God, but apostles are a group of people specially set apart for the work
If we study the context, we note that Apollos was with Paul when he wrote , and Sosthenes was a joint writer with Paul of the Epistle
Romans 16:7: 'Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners, who are of note among the apostles'
Since the meaning of the word 'apostle' is 'the sent one,' the meaning of apostleship is quite plain, that is, the office of the sent one
Many called of God are not as gifted as Paul, but if they have received a commission from God, they are just as truly apostles as he was
The apostles were gifted men, but their apostleship was not based upon their gifts; it was based upon their commission
It is futile for anyone to assume the office of an apostle simply because he thinks he has the needed gifts or ability
It takes more than mere gift and ability to constitute men apostles; it takes nothing less than God Himself, God's will, and God's call
No man can attain to apostleship through natural or other qualifications; God must make him an apostle if he is ever to be one
Whether or not a man is going to be of any spiritual worth, and his work serve any spiritual end, depends upon the sending of God
A man sent of God' should be the main characteristic of our entering upon His service, and of all our subsequent movements
In Luke 11:49 we read, 'I will send to them prophets and apostles, and some of them they will kill and persecute'
Apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are our Lord's gifts to His Church to serve in the ministry
Strictly speaking, shepherds and teachers are one gift, not two, because teaching and shepherding are closely related
In enumerating the gifts, apostles, prophets, and evangelists are all mentioned separately, while shepherds and teachers are linked together
The fact that the word 'some' is used only four times in this list indicates that there are only four classes of persons in question
Shepherding and teaching may be regarded as one ministry, because those who teach must also shepherd, and those who shepherd must also teach
The word shepherd as applied to any person is found nowhere else in the New Testament but the word teacher is used on four other occasions
It is by the operation of God that such men are 'placed in the church,' and their position is next to that of the prophets
A teacher is an individual who has received the gift of teaching from God, and has been given by the Lord to His Church for its upbuilding
They seek to lead believers to an understanding of divine truth, and they seek to lead unbelievers to an understanding of the gospel
The prophet is both a man set by God in His Church to occupy the prophetic office and a man given by the Lord to His Church for the ministry
That their position was superior to that of prophets and teachers is clear from the Word God has placed some in the church first apostles
An office is what one receives as the result of a commission; a gift is what one receives on the basis of grace
Being an apostle is not subject to receiving an apostolic gift, but subject to receiving an apostolic commission
The other ministers belong to the ministry by virtue of their gifts; an apostle belongs to the ministry by virtue of his being sent
Their qualification is the possession of gifts; his is the possession of gifts plus a special call and commission
It is immaterial to his office what personal gift an apostle has, but it is essential to his office that he be sent of God
It was their gifts that qualified them to be prophets and teachers, but it was their commission that qualified them to be apostles
The three who remained in Antioch were still prophets and teachers, not apostles, simply because they had not been sent out by the Spirit
Ephesians 4:11 does not say that the Lord gave an apostolic gift to any person, but that He gave men as apostles to His Church
We must distinguish between those gifts given by the Spirit to individuals and those given by the Lord to His Church
The first passage enumerates the gifts given to individuals; the second enumerates the gifts given to the Church
In the former there is no mention of any apostolic gift; in the latter we find that apostles head the list of God's gifts to the Church
In chapter twelve, apostles took precedence over the other ministers, but in chapter fourteen, prophets take the precedence
How does it come about that prophets take first place in the local church, since in the universal Church they only occupy the second place?
Philip left his own locality and preached in Samaria, but while he did good work there, the Spirit did not fall upon any of his converts
In the same way the prophet Agabus prophesied in another place, but his special sphere of work was his own locality
Is it only those who have seen the Lord Jesus in His resurrection manifestations who are qualified to become apostles?
Notice that in pursuing his argument in the second verse, Paul drops two of his questions and follows out the other two
Neither was he seeking to demonstrate that because he was free and had seen the Lord, therefore he was an apostle
It would be as reasonable to argue that Paul's apostleship was based upon his being free, as that it was based upon his seeing the Lord
If he was not seeking to prove his apostleship from the fact of his freedom neither was he seeking to prove it from his having seen the Lord
The object of this passage is not to produce evidence of apostleship, but evidence of the resurrection of the Lord
Indeed the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all endurance by signs and wonders and works of power'
From the above passage we infer that the evidence of apostleship lies in a twofold power-spiritual and miraculous
A true apostle needs to be 'empowered with all power, according to the might of His glory, unto all endurance and long-suffering with joy'
It takes nothing short of 'all power, according to the might of His glory' to produce 'all endurance and long-suffering with joy'
To profess to be sent ones of the omnipotent God, and yet stand helpless before situations that challenge His power, is a sad contradiction
Romans 16:7 speaks of two notable apostles, Andronicus and Junia, and good authorities agree that 'Junia' is a woman's name
Its prophets and teachers were model prophets and teachers, and the apostles it sent forth were model apostles
Since the first recorded sending out of apostles by the Holy Spirit was from Antioch, we shall do well to look carefully into its details
We must always look at the first act of the Holy Spirit in any given direction to discover His pattern for us in that particular direction
Barnabas and Saul were two ministers of the Lord already engaged in the ministry when the call of the Spirit came
Barnabas and Saul were bearing the burden of the local situation when the Spirit put the burden of other parts upon them
It was while Barnabas and Saul ministered to the Lord that the voice of the Spirit was heard calling them to special service
It was the lordship of Christ that claimed their service, and it was on His authority alone that they went forth
Earnest desires for the salvation of sinners or for the edification of saints will never qualify a man for God's work
In earthly governments there can be no service without commission, and the same holds true in the government of God
The tragedy in Christian work today is that so many of the workers have simply gone out; they have not been sent
We dare not disregard the opinion of the brethren, but their opinion is no substitute for a personal call from God
If God desires the service of any child of His, He Himself will call him to it, and He Himself will send him forth
The Holy Spirit spoke directly to the apostles, but He also spoke indirectly through the prophets and teachers
All apostles must have a personal revelation of God's will, but to make that alone the basis of their going forth is not sufficient
On the one hand, the opinion of others, however spiritual and however experienced, can never be a substitute for a direct call from God
Let us observe that the Holy Spirit did not say to the church in Antioch, 'Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul'
God therefore spoke to a representative company in the church, to men of spiritual experience who were utterly devoted to His interest
The setting apart of the apostles by the prophets and teachers followed the call which came to them from the Spirit
The separating of an apostle is the Holy Spirit speaking indirectly through the fellow workers of the called one
The laying on of hands was not by way of ordination, for Barnabas and Saul were already ordained by the Holy Spirit
As regards all sent ones, they must pay attention to these two aspects in their separation for the service of God
On the other hand, there must be a confirmation of that call by the representative members of the Body of Christ
On what ground did these prophets and teachers set certain men apart as apostles, and whom did these prophets and teachers represent?
The first half of Ephesians 4 speaks of the Body in relation to its ministry; the second half speaks of the Body in relation to its life
In Romans 12 we see how the members should care one for another, so that the thought there again is the manifestation of the one life
In 1 Corinthians 12 we see how the members should serve one another, so the thought in that passage is the manifestation of the one ministry
Because the Body of Christ has these two different aspects-life and ministry-it consequently has two different outward manifestations
The church in a locality is used to express the life of the Body and the gifts in the Church are used to express the ministry of its members
All their work should be performed as members of the Body, and not as members of an organization existing in distinction from it
A worker may employ his gifts in the capacity of an officer of an organization, but in so doing he departs from the ground of the Body
Verse 16 makes it clear that they do not stand outside the Body to build it up; they seek to build it up from within
Ministry is the practical expression of the Body, an expression of the diversity in unity of its various members
Paul, under the inspiration of the Spirit, takes special care in enumerating them-'first apostles, second prophets, third teachers'
The first three are specifically numbered, but not the rest; and they are quite distinct in their nature as well as in their numbering
The three first-named gifts of the Lord to His Church-apostles, prophets, and teachers-stand apart from all the others
They are ministers of God's Word, and their function, to edify the Body of Christ, is the most important function in the Church
The only example provided us there is the separating and sending forth of apostles by the prophets and teachers
The former expressed his identification with the life of the Body; the latter his identification with the ministry of the Body
In sending Barnabas and Saul from Antioch the prophets and teachers stood for no church or mission they represented the ministry of the Body
They bore no special name, they were bound by no particular organization, and they were subject to no fixed rules
How grand it would be if there were no representatives of different earthly bodies, but only representatives of the Body, the Body of Christ
Otherwise we lose the headship of Christ for Christ is not the Head of any system or mission or organization He is the Head of the Church
After the apostles were called by the Spirit and were separated for the work by the representative members of the Body, what did they do?
They then, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from there they sailed away to Cyprus
And putting out to sea from Paphos Paul and his companions came to Perga of Pamphylia and John departed from them and returned to Jerusalem
Is the outcome of a short period of witness in Antioch of Pisidia-many of the Jews and religious proselytes believed
The opponents of the gospel message expelled the apostles from their coasts, and they answered by shaking the dust from their feet
The early apostles never settled down in comfortable homes, nor did they stop for long to pastor the churches they founded
Was a group of new believers, mere babes in Christ, and their fathers in the faith forsook them in their infancy
Had the apostles remained to pastor them, it would have mattered little whether they were filled with the Spirit or not
In Scripture there is not the slightest hint that apostles should settle down to pastor those they have led to the Lord
There are pastors in Scripture, but they are simply brethren raised up of God from among the local saints to care for their fellow believers
The apostles were true to their apostolic calling, and off they went 'to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra and Derbe'
As elsewhere, so here, 'they announced the gospel' , and as elsewhere, so here, there was opposition and persecution
Does Paul stay to shepherd them awhile, or at least to tend them till the fierceness of the opposition has subsided?
Looking back over these two chapters, we note that a fundamental principle governs the movements of the apostles
They travel from place to place, according to the leading of the Spirit, preaching the gospel and founding churches
In studying the Word we find that the missionary tour of the apostles consisted of an outward and a return journey
It is clear then that the apostles did not just move from place to place founding churches; they also did definite construction work
Before they left a place where a church had been founded and some construction work done, they appointed elders to bear responsibility there
And from there they sailed away to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled
In all reports of the work our aim should be to glorify God and bring spiritual enrichment to those who share them
To utilize reports as a means of propaganda, with material returns in view, is base in the extreme, and unworthy of any Christian
We find reference made in the Old Testament to the elders of Israel and also to the elders of different cities
When they had appointed elders for them in every church and had prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord'
Others would continue to attend the meetings, and would prove themselves to be truly the Lord's, but would make no appreciable progress
Those who had more spiritual life than others would spontaneously come to the front and take responsibility for their weaker brethren
Apostles are responsible for their own particular ministry, but not for the churches which are the fruit of their ministry
He purposed that apostles should be responsible for the work in different places, while elders were to bear responsibility in one place
They are simply local men, following their usual pursuits and at the same time bearing special responsibilities in the church
The local character of the churches of God is preserved, and consequently also their independent government and spiritual unity
Some may ask, If all the members of a church are in a low spiritual condition, how is it possible to appoint elders among them?
Where a church is immature, the elders will naturally be immature; where a church is mature, the elders will also be mature
In the appointment of elders the apostles did not follow their personal preferences; they only appointed those whom God had already chosen
In a man-made organization the appointment of an individual to office entitles him to occupy that office; but not so in the Church of God
Those whom the Spirit chooses to be shepherds of the flock, to them He also gives grace and gifts to qualify them for spiritual leadership
It is their spiritual call and their spiritual equipment, not their official appointment, that constitutes them elders
In Scripture there are no local apostles, nor are there any extra-local elders; all elders are local, and all apostles are extra-local
All management was in the hands of the elders, and if they thought it right, they could even refuse an apostle entry into their church
In the event of their despising his counsel, Paul could only bring his spiritual authority to bear on the situation
When they went out, they ministered in the capacity of apostles, bearing the responsibility for the work in other parts
If the local character of the churches of God is to be preserved, then the extra-local character of the apostles must also be preserved
We know he did not hold the office of elder in any church, but it would have been possible for him to be an elder in Antioch, not in Ephesus
Bishop means overseer, and an overseer is not one who works instead of others, but one who supervises others as they work
Elders are not a group of men who contract to do the church work on behalf of its members; they are only the ones who superintend affairs
Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching'
The ordering of church government, the management of business affairs, and the care of material things are all under their control
If the elders lose sight of that, then their leading the church will soon be changed to lording it over the church
It also implied that the elders worked with special diligence and care, so that the brethren should have a good example to follow
Paul wrote to Titus that an elder should 'be able both to exhort by the healthy teaching and to convict those who oppose'
As we have already seen, the management of a church is a matter of local responsibility; so also is teaching and preaching
On the spiritual side of the work the elders help to build up the church not only by teaching and preaching, but by pastoral work
Peter wrote in the same strain to the elders among the saints of the Dispersion, 'Shepherd the flock of God among you'
To have pastors in a church is scriptural, but the present-day pastoral system is quite unscriptural; it is an invention of man
In the Gospels the word is used on both occasions by our Lord, but it is employed in a somewhat different sense each time
The sphere of the church referred to here is clearly not as wide as the sphere of the Church mentioned in the previous passage
Obviously the church here is local, not universal, for no one could speak at one time to all the children of God throughout the universe
We have clearly two different aspects of the Church before us-the Church and the churches, the universal Church and the local churches
Now a church is composed of all 'the called-out ones assembled' in one place for worship, prayer, fellowship, and ministry
It is not a building, a gospel hall, a preaching center, a mission, a work, an organization, a system, a denomination, or a sect
We have seen that all the churches in Scripture are local churches, but the question naturally arises, What is a scriptural locality?
In Scripture the localities which determine the boundary of a church are neither countries, nor provinces, nor districts
In the Word of God we see no church that extends beyond the area of a city, nor do we find any church which does not cover the entire area
Large cities such as Rome and Jerusalem are only units, while small cities such as Iconium and Troas are likewise units
London is clearly not a city in the scriptural sense of the term, and it cannot therefore be regarded as a unit
As to country-places which could not technically be termed cities, they may also be regarded as unit-localities
Since the limits of a locality mark the limits of a church, then no church can be narrower than a locality, and none wider
To say I am of Paul or I am of Cephas is obviously sectarian but to say I am of Christ is sectarian too though less obviously so
It extends over the entire area of the locality, and includes the entire number of the Christians in the locality
We read of a multitude who turned to the Lord; yet they are all referred to as the church in Jerusalem, not the churches in Jerusalem
Jerusalem was a single place; therefore, it could only be counted as a single unit for the founding of a single church
In the Word of God we never read of the church in Macedonia, or the church in Galatia, or the church in Judea, or the church in Galilee
Both include a number of units; therefore, they include a number of separate churches and do not constitute one church
It was not God's plan to unite the churches of different places into one church, but to have a separate church in each place
Again the reference is not to one single church, because Syria and Cilicia were vast districts, each comprising a number of different places
There may be unions or mergers in the commercial or political world, but God sanctions no combinations among the churches
A church according to the divine thought is always a church in one locality; any other kind of church is a product of the human mind
In Scripture there is always one church in one place, never several churches in one place, nor one church in several places
In the division of churches the question of country or province does not arise; it is all a question of cities
When our Lord sent messages to His children in Asia He did not address them as the church in Asia but the seven churches which are in Asia
The confusion in Pergamos could not be laid to the charge of Philadelphia, because Philadelphia was independent of Pergamos
There is no outward organization forming them into one big combined unit, but there is a strong inward bond uniting them in the Lord
In organization the churches are totally independent of one another, but in life they are one, and consequently interdependent
While the churches minister one to the other, they should always preserve their independence of government and responsibility
It is a tragedy that today an injunction to follow 'all the churches' would lead, not into, but away from, the will of God!
Paul is saying in effect, 'Although you are independent of other churches, yet you must not disregard their example'
A willingness to help one another, and to learn from one another, should mark the relationship between the various churches
What the more mature churches have learned from the Lord, the less experienced should be ready to learn from them
For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus,' wrote Paul to the Thessalonians
The church in Thessalonica was younger than the churches in Judea; therefore, it was only fitting that they should learn from them
There is a beautiful balance in the teaching of God's Word regarding the relationship between the various churches
On the one hand, they are totally independent of one another in matters relating to responsibility, government, and organization
Each must rather cultivate a relationship with the other churches, seeking their sympathy and working with their spiritual good in view
On the other hand, since each is totally independent of the other, the decision of a church in any locality is absolutely final
There is no organization to whose control it must submit, nor is there any organization over which it exercises control
If any one is received or refused by a local church, its judgment in the matter must be regarded as absolutely decisive
There is no alternative course, because the relationship which exists between the churches is purely spiritual, not official
Why, when a question arose concerning circumcision, did Paul and Barnabas go to Jerusalem to see the apostles and elders there?
Jerusalem was the place where this problem originated; therefore, it was to Jerusalem the apostles went to have it settled
Since the churches of God are local, we must be careful to preserve their local character, their local sphere, and their local boundary
That is contrary to God's order, and destroys its local nature by putting the imprint of an extra-local minister upon it
No worker may exercise control over a church or attach to it his name or the name of the society he represents
The divine disapproval will always rest on 'the church of Paul,' or 'the church of Apollos,' or 'the church of Cephas'
Whenever the divinely-appointed sphere of locality is displaced by a sphere of human invention, there the divine approval cannot rest
It is contrary to human nature to stress what we have in common with others; we always emphasize what is ours in particular
Where churches are not affiliated, and where local authority is in the hands of local elders, a pope is an impossibility
It is the federation of different companies of believers that has brought such evils as dabbling in politics into the Church of God
God's thought for His Church is that she should be like a mustard seed on earth, full of vitality, yet scarcely noticed
The greatest advantage of having locality as the boundary of the churches is that it precludes all possibility of sects
It is still possible for a sectarian spirit to exist in a non-sectarian church, and only the Spirit of God can deal with that
Without a single word of explanation they are referred to in the following chapter as the church-'And great fear came upon the whole church'
In Acts 8:1, immediately after the death of Stephen, the word is again used, and the connection in this case is clearer than before
Later on in the course of the apostles first missionary tour many people were saved in different places through the preaching of the gospel
The groups of believers in these different places are called churches, without any explanation whatever as to how they came to be churches
Without introduction or explanation of any kind, the Word of God presents such a group of believers to us as a church
The scriptural method of founding a church is simply by preaching the gospel; nothing further is necessary, or even permissible
Let us note well that the ground of our receiving anyone into the church is that the Lord has already received that one
Our receiving him does not make him a member of the church; rather, it is that we receive him because he is already a member
If we demand anything beyond his reception by the Lord before admitting him to fellowship, then we are not a church at all, but only a sect
When we know what kind of persons belong to the Church, then we know also what kind of persons belong to a church
If we wish to know who belongs to the Lord, then we only need to discover whether he has the Spirit of Christ or not
Whoever has the Spirit of Christ is inside the Church circle, and whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ is outside the circle
A participant of the Spirit of God is an essential part of the Church of God a nonparticipant of the Spirit of God has no part in the Church
There is a subjective line of demarcation between the Church and the world all within that line are saved and all without that line are lost
The Church of God includes a vast number of believers, living at different times, and scattered in different places throughout the earth
With such differences in age social position education background outlook and temperament how could all these people become one church
Paul besought all believers to endeavor to keep the oneness of the Spirit he did not exhort us to have the oneness but merely to keep it
We cannot insist on oneness of opinions, or oneness of experience, or any other oneness among believers, except the oneness of the Spirit
They are the seven elements in the oneness of the Spirit, which is the common heritage of all the children of God
Those who are outside that sphere have no spiritual relationship with us, but those who are inside that sphere are all in fellowship with us
If he has received the Spirit of Christ, and we have received the Spirit of Christ, then we are one in the Lord, and nothing must divide us
All who share this one hope are one, and since we have the hope of being together in glory for all eternity, how can we be divided in time?
There is only one Lord, the Lord Jesus, and all who recognize that God has made Jesus of Nazareth to be both Lord and Christ are one in Him
If anyone confesses Jesus to be Lord, then his Lord is our Lord, and since we serve the same Lord, nothing whatever can separate us
The children of God may follow many different lines of scriptural interpretation, but in regard to this fundamental faith they are one
Those who lack this faith have no part in the family of God, but all who possess it we recognize as our brothers in the Lord
By this we do not imply that it is of no consequence whether we are sprinkled or immersed, or whether our baptism is spiritual or literal
The division of the Church into churches is not a division in nature, life, or essence, but only in government, organization, and management
Because the earthly church is composed of a vast number of individuals, a measure of organization is indispensable
It is not that the constituents of one local church are of one kind, and the constituents of another local church are of another kind
Physical limitations make geographical divisions inevitable, but the spiritual oneness of believers overcomes all barriers of space
Locality is the divinely-appointed ground for the division of the Church, because it is the only inevitable division
Any division of the children of God other than geographical implies not merely a division of sphere, but a division of nature
Most believers of today are so utterly blind to the scriptural basis of a church that if one asks another, 'To what church do you belong'?
It is our being in Christ that separates us from the world, and it is our being in a given locality that separates us from other believers
They sought to divide the church on the ground of a few leaders who had been specially used of God in their midst
Hero worship is a tendency of human nature, which delights to show preference for those who appeal to its tastes
Spiritual leaders are no adequate reason for dividing the Church; neither are the instruments used of God in our salvation
Some of the Corinthian believers proclaimed themselves to be 'of Cephas,' others 'of Paul,' others 'of Apollos'
That so many of God's servants have not yet realized that they are servants of the local church, not masters of a private 'church'
The very thought of distinguishing between the children of God has its springs in the carnal nature of man, and is sectarian
Although these other believers say they are of Paul, of Cephas, and of Apollos, yet in fact they are of Christ
Our fellowship must be with all the believers in a locality, not merely with all the unsectarian believers in that locality
We dare not differentiate between ourselves and them, because they differentiate between themselves and others
It is not a denominational church, nor an interdenominational church, nor even an undenominational church we are after, but a local church
The difference between a local church and an undenominational church is as vast as the difference between heaven and earth
The church in Corinth' is scriptural, but 'the church of all those who say, 'I am of Christ' in Corinth' is unscriptural
We ourselves must be undenominational, but we must not demand undenominationalism of other Christians as the basis of our fellowship
If we come to a place where Christ is not named, we must preach the gospel, win men to the Lord, and found a local church
On the other hand, it is possible for them to see all the evils of sectarianism, and leave them, without knowing what a local church is
If when we say our brethren we do not include all the children of God but only those who continually meet with us then we are schismatic
We shall find there will be no need to stress the question of denominations, for the Spirit Himself will enlighten them
If a believer has not learned the way of the cross and the walk in the Spirit, what is gained by his coming out of a sect?
The Interlinear New Testament translates it as 'sects,' while Darby in his New Translation renders it 'schools of opinion'
Some believe that supernatural manifestations are a necessary accompaniment to the baptism in the Holy Spirit, while others do not
Though some may be right and others wrong, God does not sanction any division on account of difference as to such beliefs
The purpose of God is that a church should represent the children of God in a locality, not represent some specific truth there
A church of God in any place comprises all the children of God in that place, not merely those who hold the same doctrinal views
The question is not whether they agree with our presentation of truth, but whether they are standing on clear church ground
If our hearts are set to preserve the local character of the churches of God, we cannot fail to come up against problems in our work
How the flesh would like just to include those holding the same views, and to exclude all whose views differ from ours
Under the circumstances, if we do not know the cross, we shall probably argue, lose our temper, and finally go our own way
Therefore let us judge one another no longer, but rather judge this: not to put a stumbling block or cause of falling before your brother'
When they recognize their position in the Body, they will know that it is not given to everyone to determine matters of doctrine
They must learn to submit to those who have been equipped of God for the specific ministry of teaching His people
Spiritual gifts and spiritual experience are necessary for spiritual teaching; consequently not everyone can teach
God does not permit any division of His children on the ground of difference of color, custom, or manner of living
The whole matter hinges here-are all carnal differences done away with in Christ, or is there still a place for the flesh in the Church?
Let us remember that the church in any locality includes all the believers living there and excludes all who live elsewhere
Jews and Gentiles represent national as well as racial distinctions, but in the Church of God there is neither Jew nor Greek
In the natural realm there is a difference between Chinese, French, British, and Americans, but in the spiritual realm there is none
A change of residence necessarily involves a change of church, whereas naturalization has no effect on church membership
Our fellow workers who have gone from China to the South Sea Islands must be careful not to form an Overseas Chinese church there
It is possible to have an Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce, or an Overseas Chinese College, or an Overseas Chinese Club
If you go to any city in a foreign land, then it follows as a matter of course that you belong to the church in that city
How glorious it would be if the saved in every city could overlook all natural differences and only consider their spiritual oneness
We are the believers in Christ in such-and-such a place' is the finest confession a company of Christians can make
The usual conception of an indigenous church, while quite right in some respects, is fundamentally wrong at the most vital point
The Church of God knows neither Jew nor Greek therefore it knows neither native nor foreigner neither heathen country nor Christian country
The attempt to form all Chinese believers into one church shows a lack of understanding in regard to the divine basis of forming churches
On the one hand, there is no church of the Gentiles in Scripture; on the other hand, we read of 'the church of the Thessalonians'
There is no such thing in the thought of God as the church of the Chinese, but there is such a thing as the church of the Pekinese
In Scripture we have at least seven definite things referred to which are forbidden by God as reasons for dividing His Church
As a matter of fact these seven points are only typical of all other reasons the human mind may devise for dividing the Church of God
Should local methods, government, and organization be far from ideal, that still constitutes no reason for division
Spiritually they were wrong, but positionally they were right; therefore, God only commanded those in them to be overcomers
If you leave a local church, you do so without the authority of the Lord, and you become guilty of the sin of schism in the Body
If we are to understand the mind of God concerning His work, then we must differentiate clearly between the work and the churches
The Spirit has used the expression in an inclusive way to cover all that related to the purpose of the apostolic call
Church affairs are to be managed by local men who, on account of their comparative spiritual maturity, have been appointed to be elders
The apostles are responsible for the work in any place, and the church is responsible for all the children of God there
If elders, then our responsibility is confined to local affairs; if apostles, then our responsibility is extra-local
The reason God called apostles and entrusted the work to them is that He wished to preserve the local character of the church
The responsibility of the work in different places is committed to apostles, whose sphere extends beyond the locality
An Ephesian elder is an elder in Ephesus, but he ceases to be an elder when he comes to Philippi, and vice versa
When Paul was at Miletus, he wished to see the representative members of the church in Ephesus, so he sent for the Ephesian elders
Much confusion has arisen because the divine line of demarcation between the churches and the work has been lost sight of
It is commendable if a local church seeks to help in the work; but it is under no official obligation to do so
In the matter of official responsibility there are certain prescribed duties, and one is in the wrong if one fails to perform them
Any neglect of responsibility does not register as an official shortcoming, but it does register as a low spiritual state
The church does not come within the sphere of the work and is consequently outside the sphere of their authority
It might be quite in order for one or more brothers to open a restaurant or a hotel, but that would not be in order for a church
What may be perfectly permissible in the case of brothers as individuals is not necessarily permissible in the case of a church as a company
The work is beyond the sphere of any church as a corporate body; it is the responsibility of individuals, though not of individuals as such
A church exists for the purpose of mutual help in one place, not for the purpose of bearing the responsibility of work in different places
The work is the responsibility of individuals who are called and commissioned by God, and not the responsibility of the whole church
Let it be clearly understood, by individuals we do not mean individuals as individuals, but as functioning members representing the Body
It is not individuals, as individuals, that undertake the work, but individuals as representing the Body of Christ
Why did Paul live in 'his own rented dwelling' and preach and teach from there and not from the already existing church?
We need to remember that the Word does not state the reason Paul rented a house and preached and taught there; it only mentions the fact
All that is written there is written for our learning, and even a seemingly casual remark may enfold a precious lesson
In two short sentences we have an important principle, namely, that the apostolic work and the local church are quite distinct
When Paul left Corinth, his work left, but the church in Corinth continued, although the fruits of his work were left in the church
Every one of God's workmen must have a clean-cut line of demarcation between his work and the church in the place of his labors
It is not God's will that the work of an apostle should take the place of the work of the church, or be in any wise identified with it
Since it was dependent on him neither for its origin nor its continuance, it would be unaffected by his departure
Work is work, and church is church, and these two lines never converge, but keep running parallel one to the other
We must encourage them to read the Word, to pray, to give, to witness, and to assemble for fellowship and ministry
Workers never think of reading, praying, and witnessing for them, but they do not see any harm in arranging meetings for them
Your meetings are your responsibility, and a regular assembling of yourselves is one of your chief duties and privileges'
We must go and break bread with them, join with them in the exercise of spiritual gifts, and take part in their prayer meetings
Self-government, self-support, and self-propagation' has been the slogan of many workers for a number of years now
It is not surprising that in the process of time, problems arise in connection with self-government, self-support, and self-propagation
If from the outset Christians learned to gather together according to the Scriptures, many problems would be avoided
The apostle's goal is to build up the church, not to build up his work or any group of people that may have sent him out
The result is that the mission extends all the while and becomes quite an imposing organization, but local churches are scarcely to be found
Because there are no local churches, the mission has to send workers to different places as 'pastors' of the various companies of Christians
When an apostle comes to a place where a local church already exists, he must never forget that no church authority rests with him
Should he desire to work in a place where the local church does not wish to have him, then all he can do is to pass on to some other part
If he forms a separate company of believers where a local church already exists, he will be forming a sect and not a church
Despite its attitude toward the apostle personally, all the fruit of his labors must be contributed to that church
If they welcome the worker, the result of his labors goes to them; if they reject him, it goes to them just the same
We require deeper spiritual experience and clearer spiritual light if we are to be workers acceptable to God and to His Church
Many servants of God trust Him to open up spiritual truths to them but they cannot trust Him to open doors for the reception of those truths
The work of God does not sanction the establishment of a church for the propagation of any particular line of teaching
When a specific ministry has been raised up of God to meet a specific need in His Church, what should be the attitude of the minister?
Wherever ministry is made the occasion for the forming of a church, there you have the beginning of a new denomination
If the Lord delays His coming and His servants remain true to Him, He will certainly raise up new ministries in the Word
Some of the hearers will question the truths, others reject them, and others condemn, while there will be those who gladly respond
No thought must be entertained of forming a separate 'church' comprising those believers who support the special doctrines emphasized
We can establish local churches and contribute our ministry to such churches, but we dare not establish ministerial churches
His plan is that His servants should just establish a local church, and then contribute their different ministries to that church
As soon as it has been formed, we should seek to serve it with whatever ministry the Lord has entrusted to us, and then leave it
We dare to exercise our ministry faithfully, but having done so, we dare to leave the church open to other ministry
There must be no thought of dominating a church by our personality or by our ministry; the field must be left clear for all God's servants
There is no need to build a wall of protection around 'our' particular 'flock' to secure them against the teachings of others
Local responsibility is with the elders; they must watch the interests of the flock in the matter of ministries
It must not be inferred from the foregoing that God has no other workmen but apostles and the various ministers of the Word
God has many servants who are bearing the burden of various works of faith, such as schools, orphanages, and hospitals
In the thought of God only one company of people exists, and all His designs of grace center in that one company-His Church
In the sphere of their work they hold the position of God's servants, but in the sphere of the church they are only brethren
If we make our work the basis of a separate unit of God's people, then we are building up a sect, not a church
Among them we find a certain amount of association; we see here a little group, and there another, linked together for the work
We recognize that the Lord is the Head of the Church, and that the apostles were the first order 'placed' by the Lord in the Church
They did not make a company smaller than the Body to be the basis of their work; all was on the ground of the Body
They were constituted into separate companies, but each company stood on the ground of the Body, expressing the ministry of the Body
All carnal strife among the workers of God will be at an end once the Body is clearly seen as the principle of the work
Life and work in the Body necessitate drastic dealings with the flesh, and that in turn necessitates a deep knowledge of the cross of Christ
We see that at Troas, Luke joined their company and was of one mind with Paul in considering that the Macedonian cry should be responded to
While we must guard against the snare of man-made organizations, we must also guard against the danger of being too individualistic
We need to emphasize this fact, that the apostles worked in association with others, but their companies were not organized
We, going ahead onto the ship, set sail for Assos, from there intending to pick up Paul, for so he had arranged'
The above Scriptures show us that among the workers of God dependence upon Him does not render us independent of one another
As long as the officebearer retains his position just so long can he exert his authority as soon as he resigns office his authority ceases
The reason Paul could direct others was not because of his superior position, but because of his greater spirituality
In a spiritual association there is no compulsion; direction and submission alike are on the ground of spirituality
Because of difference of ministry, we must on the one hand obey the Lord, and on the other we must obey the brethren
If the head is moving the tips of my fingers, the muscles of my arms cannot take an independent attitude and refuse to move with them
In many things we can claim a direct guidance from the Head, but in just as many things the Head moves others and we simply move with them
We have to know our ministry and to recognize the ministry of others, so that we can move as one obeying those who have a greater ministry
He lived close to the Lord, obeying and serving Him faithfully; yet many a time he was sent here or there by Paul
A young Timothy ought to obey the commands of the Holy Spirit, but he ought also to receive the instructions of an elderly Paul
It is most important in His work to learn how to be led by the Spirit and how, at the same time, to cooperate with our fellow workers
Not only must the younger learn to submit to the instructions of the elder, but the elder must learn how to instruct the younger
Paul must direct Timothy in such a way that he will not find it hard to obey both the Holy Spirit and the apostle
We should seek to know His will, not independently, but in conjunction with the other ministering members of the Body
Acts 13 gives us a good example of a working company all the workers being mutually related and the guidance of one confirmed by the others
We see here not the movements of the local church but of the work, for the movements of the local church are always confined to one locality
There is no need for the church in Ephesus to send a man to Corinth, or for the church in Corinth to leave a man in Rome
Although Paul had 'those with him,' and Peter his associates, they comprised only a number of apostles, not all the apostles
Had it been centralized, those groups could not have remained in existence, for they could have been dealt with effectively
The explanation is this: God does not wish the power of organization to take the place of the power of the Holy Spirit
Whenever people cease to obey the Spirit and labor in the power of the flesh then it is best if the work is simply allowed to fall to pieces
It is a scriptural fact that God's servants are formed into companies, but they are not formed into one single company
That does not mean that every company could just go on independently, knowing no relatedness or fellowship with other companies
The principle of the oneness of the Body holds good here as in all other relationships between the children of God
In Scripture we not only see the principle of 'the laying on of hands,' but also that of giving 'the right hand'
In Antioch the sphere in view was one apostolic company, and the point emphasized was identification; consequently, hands were laid on them
Many are called to work for the Lord, but their sphere of service is not the same, so it follows that their associates cannot be the same
The various companies must all be identified with the Body, coming under the headship of the Lord, and having fellowship among themselves
There is no laying on of hands between Antioch and Jerusalem, but there is the giving of the right hand of fellowship
The basis of fellowship in the church is the common possession of life in Christ and living in the same locality
Thereafter Peter came to Corinth and preached the gospel, with the result that another group of people believed
Apollos coming to Corinth would in turn follow their example and establish another church as a branch of the one from which he came out
If every worker tried to form a branch of the church he represented, then sects and denominations would be utterly inevitable
Now there are two kinds of workers, namely, those who stand on scriptural ground, and those who stand on denominational or mission ground
The danger which confronts the missionary is to form those he has led to the Lord into a branch of the society he represents
The immediate aim of the various workers is no doubt the same-what preacher does not hope that many souls will be won to the Lord?
Now do those saved by your instrumentality become the X Church or do they become the church of the particular locality in which they live
No information whatever is given as to how the needs of the work or the personal needs of the workers were supplied
Today as then, the matter of finance will present no problems to those who have a vital faith in God and a real love for Him
If God's servants do not clearly settle the question of finance, then they leave a vast number of other questions unsettled too
If the work is of God, it will be spiritual; and if the work is spiritual, the way of supply will be spiritual
If supplies are not on a spiritual plane, then the work itself will speedily drift on to the plane of secular business
If spirituality does not characterize the financial side of the work, then the spirituality of its other departments is merely theoretical
Every worker, no matter what his ministry, must exercise faith for the meeting of all his personal needs and all the needs of his work
We do read there of a Balaam who sought to make merchandise of his gift of prophecy, but he is denounced in no uncertain terms
We read also of a Gehazi who sought to make gain of the grace of God, but he was stricken with leprosy for his sin
No servant of God should look to any human agency, whether an individual or a society, for the meeting of his temporal needs
If a man can trust God, let him go out and work for Him; if not, let him stay at home, for he lacks the first qualification for the work
When it comes to financial needs, the matter is so practical that the reality of our faith is put to the test at once
It is only to be expected that if we receive an income from a certain source, we should have to account for our doings to such a source
If we are supported by men, then we must seek to please men, and it is often impossible at the same time both to please men and God
At times we have fancied God would have us do a certain thing, but He has showed us it was not His will by withholding financial supplies
If he cannot trust God for the supply of needed funds, can he trust Him in all the problems and difficulties of the work?
If we have real faith in God, then we have to bear all the responsibility of our own needs and the needs of the work
We have no board behind us, but we have a Rock beneath us; and no one standing on this Rock will ever be put to shame
We are apt to trust in the children of the Lord who in bygone days have sent us gifts, but they will all pass away
The two initial steps in the work of God are-first, the prayer of faith for needed funds, then the actual undertaking of the work
They undertake the work without having the essential qualification for it; therefore, what they do has no spiritual value
Faith is the first essential in any work for God, and it should be exercised in relation to material as well as other needs
No definite period of time is named, no definite sum of money, and no definite responsibility; all is a matter of freewill
It is upon Him their eyes are fixed, it is to Him their needs are told, and it is He who touches the hearts of His children to give
Paul himself received the gift from the church in Philippi , and when he was in Corinth, he was helped by the brothers in Macedonia
Paul received occasional gifts from individuals and from churches, but he received no definite remuneration for his preaching
If the call and the commission have come from Him, then He must and surely will be responsible for all that our obedience to Him involves
When we make our needs known to Him, He will certainly hear, and He will move the hearts of men to supply us with all we need
To work with our hands may be very good, but we need to note that Paul does not regard that as the usual thing
If we have sown to you the spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap from you the fleshly things?
It is not permissible to receive a definite salary from a church, and at times it is not even permissible to receive an indefinite gift
The Israelites made their offerings to God, not to the Levites, but the latter stood in the place of God to receive the offerings
Today we are standing in the position of the Levites, and the gifts that are proffered to us are really offered to God
We should only receive money when our doing so involves no obligation on our part, and on God's part no misrepresentation of His nature
No servant of God should sacrifice his liberty to follow the divine leading by accepting any money which puts him under human control
In secular work the man who supplies the means exercises authority in the realm to which his means are devoted, but not so in spiritual work
All the counsel we seek and receive from others is on account of their spirituality, not on account of their financial position
If God has not accepted a man, He can never accept his money, and only what God can accept dare His servants accept
If in the providence of God we visit some Miletus, then we should do well to accept the hospitality of a friendly Publius
The Scriptures pay much attention to the needy children of God, and a large proportion of the local offerings goes to relieve their distress
It is a dishonor to the Lord if any representative of His discloses needs that would provoke pity on the part of others
There is always something over, When we trust our gracious Lord; Every cup He fills o'erfloweth, His great rivers all are broad
Nothing narrow, nothing stinted, Ever issued from His store; To His own He gives full measure, Running over, evermore
There is always something over, When we, from the Father's Hand, Take our portion with thanksgiving, Praising for the path He planned
Satisfaction, full and deepening, Fills the soul, and lights the eye, When the heart has trusted Jesus All its need to satisfy
There is always something over, When we tell of all His love; Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us, Unscaled heights rise far above
Let us keep our financial needs secret, even if our secrecy should lead men to conclude that we are well off when we have nothing at all
We dare to make things difficult for God, because He requires no assistance from us in order to perform His miracles
The present method of a church supporting its own 'minister' or its own missionary was a thing unknown in apostolic days
The distinction between the church and the work must be clearly defined in the mind of the worker, especially as regards financial matters
Should a worker pay a short visit to any place on the invitation of the church, then it is quite right for him to receive their hospitality
Should he stay for an indefinite period, then he must bear the burden alone before God; otherwise, his faith in God will wane
Even should a brother willingly offer free hospitality, it ought to be declined, for the life of faith must be carefully maintained
For neither were we found at any time with flattering speech, even as you know, nor with a pretext for covetousness; God is witness'
Not only should we receive no salary, we should be careful not to take the slightest advantage of any of our brethren
Apostles should be willing to be taken advantage of, but on no account should they ever take advantage of others
It is a shameful thing to profess trust in God and yet play the role of a pauper, disclosing one's needs and provoking others to pity
Let us be clear that we must not only bear the burden of our own personal needs, but of the needs of the work as well
He is not worthy to be called Gods servant who cannot be responsible for his own needs and the needs of the work to which God has called him
Not the local church, but the one to whom the work has been committed, must bear all financial burdens connected with it
Another point to which we must give attention is a clear discrimination between gifts intended for personal use and gifts given for the work
Taylor said he would go that way, in spite of the fact that the agent told him they never made connections there
Let him only draw the attention of the churches to the wants of others, and God will draw their attention to his wants
Let us beware of extending the work ourselves, for if the extension is of man, we shall have to use man-made methods to meet the new demands
If God sees the work needs extension, He Himself will extend it, and if He extends it, He will be responsible to meet the increased needs
The spontaneous growth of the work of God does not necessitate any activities of human nature, for God meets all demands which He creates
The wisdom of the world declares that 'the end justifies the means,' but it is never so in the spiritual realm
We must let the Holy Spirit hinder us where He will, and not seek to urge things forward by touching divine work with human hands
If He moves men to help us, then all is well, but if we seek to move men ourselves, both we and the work will suffer loss
Even should people conclude from our manner of living that we have a private income, and in consequence withhold their gifts, we do not mind
If anyone among us is only a receiver and not a giver, he is unworthy of Him who sent him and those who labor with him
The scope of our thinking along the line of material needs should always be on the basis of 'my needs and to those who are with me'
Whether we are good fellow workers or not will be evidenced by the measure of our thoughtfulness for our brethren in the work
Working on such a basis, no headquarters is necessary; for each of us acts as a sort of headquarters and distributing center
Of course that does not mean we must send an equal share to all who are associated with us; that is a matter of individual guidance
Anyone who has gathered much must be willing to have nothing over, for only then can he who has gathered little have no lack
It is a privilege to be able to help your brethren in the work, and to be able to give away even the greater proportion of your income
Those who have only learned to take seldom receive; but those who have learned to give are always receiving and have always more to give
We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose'
For two reasons: first, in God's Word all association of workers is on a spiritual basis, not on an official one
In an organization there is bound to be some income, and every member is sure to receive a share, whether he exercises faith or not
Humanly speaking, it insures a much greater income, for many of God's children prefer to give to organizations rather than to individuals
As a rule he is specially trained for church work, but he may be either a local man, or a worker transferred from some other place
You may term it a hall, a meeting place, a chapel, or a church; but whatever you care to call it, such a place there must be
What is considered essential to a church these days, was considered totally unnecessary in the early days of the Church's history
Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons'
The deacons are the men appointed to serve tables , that is, those who care exclusively for the business side of things
They do not occupy such an important position as the elders, who rule the church; they are chosen by the church to serve it
As a rule they have their families, and their business duties, and are just ordinary believers of good reputation
The members of the church are local men, and as elders are chosen from among the ordinary members, it follows that they are also local men
The business of the worker is to found churches and appoint elders, never to take direct responsibility in the churches
No apostle coming from another place is qualified for the office of local elder; the post can only be occupied by local men
The thought in the questioner's mind is, 'Who is the man responsible for ministering and administering spiritual things in this church'?
If, in a company of believers, the minister is active and the church members are all passive, then that company is a mission, not a church
The thought of a church is so frequently associated with a church building, that the building itself is often referred to as 'the church'
According to Scripture it is not even necessary for a church to have a place definitely set apart for fellowship
The Jews always had their special meeting places, and wherever they went they made a point of building a synagogue in which to worship God
The amazing thing is that, not only did they not put up special buildings, but they seem to have ignored the whole subject intentionally
The temple of the New Testament is not a material edifice; it consists of living persons, all believers in the Lord
Because the New Testament temple is spiritual the question of meeting places for believers or places of worship is one of minor importance
He gathered them around Him now in a house, again in a boat, and there were times when He drew apart with them in an upper room
Judging from these passages, the believers assembled in a great variety of places and had no official meeting place
They had no buildings specially set apart for church use; they had nothing which would correspond to the 'church' of today
There was no official stamp upon it; it bore the marks of real life, in its perfect naturalness and pure simplicity
It was quite all right for some of the saints to sit on the window-ledge, or for others to sit on the floor, as Mary did of old
God wants the intimacy of the upper room to mark the gatherings of His children, not the stiff formality of an imposing public edifice
We read of the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila , the church in the house of Nymphas , and the church in the house of Philemon
Of course, not every church is a church in a house, but a church in a house should be encouraged rather than considered as a drawback
Somehow, as soon as people enter those special buildings, they involuntarily settle down to passivity, and wait to be preached to
A family atmosphere should pervade all gatherings of the children of God, so that the brothers even feel free to ask questions
The imposing structures of our modern times convey an impression of the world rather than of the Christ whose name they bear
Meetings connected with the work are arranged along totally different lines, and are entirely under the auspices of the workers
As we have seen, when Paul reached Rome a church was already in existence there, and the believers already had their regular gatherings
Paul did not use the meeting place of the church for his work, but rented a separate place, as he stayed for a prolonged period in Rome
In Troas he only stayed for a week, so he did not rent a place there, but simply accepted the hospitality of the church
When he went away, the special meetings he had been conducting there ceased, but the brethren in Troas still continued their own meetings
Christ is the Head of the Church and 'we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another'
Apart from Christ, the Church has no head; all believers are only members, and they are 'members one of another'
All those who compose a church take their place as members of the Body, not one occupying the position of head
If we are to differentiate clearly between the two, we must first understand the different nature of church and work
One stood before the others, and by his preaching directed the thoughts and hearts of those who sat quietly listening
In the church meetings, 'each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation'
It is not a case of one leading and all the others following, but of each one contributing his share of spiritual helpfulness
True only a few of those present take part but all may only a few are actual contributors to the meeting but all are potential contributors
The meeting which was held immediately after the Church came into existence was an apostolic meeting for unbelievers
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
The prophets and teachers minister the Word as the Lord gives it, while others minister to the assembly in other ways
An opportunity is given to each member of the church to help others, and an opportunity is given to each one to be helped
That such assemblies are assemblies of the church is seen at a glance, because the stamp of mutuality is clearly upon all the proceedings
The last type of meeting is a church meeting, for the phrase 'in the church' is used repeatedly in the passage which describes it
Individual responsibility has been lost sight of, and passivity has hindered the development of spiritual life throughout the churches
An apostle settles down to pastor the church, and consequently the churches and the work both lose their distinctive features
For lack of activity the spiritual growth of the churches is arrested, and for lack of apostles the extension of the work is arrested too
Each individual must bear his share of responsibility and pass on to the others what he himself has received from the Lord
When the local church meets, it is the gifts that are brought into use; office has no place here, not even that of an apostle
Apostles, as apostles, represent an office in the work, and not any particular gift; therefore, here they are ignored altogether
In the organization of the church they have no place at all, because their ministry, as apostles, was not for the churches but for the work
The elders are those who hold office in a local church; the prophets and teachers are the gifted ministers in a local church
The elders are for church government at all times; the prophets and teachers are for ministry in church meetings
As to ministry, though they cannot minister as elders, yet, if they are also prophets or teachers, they can minister in that capacity
It is almost imperative that elders be prophets and teachers; otherwise, they cannot rule the church effectively
The point to be remembered is that church meetings are the sphere for the ministry of the Word not the sphere for the exercise of any office
The latter may be of a passing nature, and not necessarily a permanent institution, whereas the former are a regular feature of church life
It affords opportunity for an expression of mutuality, that essential feature of all relationships in the church
The churches, having to bear their own responsibility, will develop their own spiritual life and gifts through exercise
And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers
For such meetings a special place could be obtained either for the occasion, or permanently, according to existing church conditions
Local believers should learn to use the spiritual gifts with which God has entrusted them to minister to their fellow believers
The principle on which all church meetings are conducted is that of the 'round-table,' not of the 'pulpit-and-pew'
When any apostle visits a place, he could lead a series of meetings for the local church, but such meetings are exceptional
In the usual church gatherings the brethren should all make their special contributions in the power and under the leading of the Spirit
If the churches follow the lines God Himself has laid down for them His work will go forward unhindered and His kingdom be extended on earth
In the earlier chapters of this book we have already seen what the ministry, the work, and the local churches are
The prophets and teachers , whose sphere is local, plus the apostles, whose sphere is extra-local, constitute the ministry
As the former serve the churches, and the latter the work, the ministry is designed of God to meet the spiritual need in both spheres
The work is produced by the churches the churches are founded as a result of the work and the ministry serves both the churches and the work
Those who have both gifts and apostolic commission serve the Church by serving the churches in different localities
They were given to the Church 'for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
The ministry of these two groups of men is of great importance, because all the work of God-local and extra-local-is in their hands
That is why God's Word declares that the Church of God is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets
In the offices instituted by God we have the elders occupying the chief place in the local church while apostles hold no office at all there
In the local church, there are two departments of service, one relating to business management, the other to spiritual ministry
It should be repeated that elders, as such, are appointed for church government, and not for meetings to edify the church
Timothy 5:17 makes it clear that the usual sphere of their service is to rule, but some of them may also teach and minister
The ministry, the work, and the churches are quite different in function and sphere, but they are really coordinated and interrelated
Ephesians 4 speaks of the Body of Christ, but no discrimination is made there between the churches, the work, and the ministry
They are really one; so while it is necessary to distinguish between them in order to understand them better, we cannot really separate them
Those who are in the different spheres of the Church need to see the reality of the Body of Christ and act relatedly as a body
The churches are the Body expressed locally, the ministry is the Body in function, and the work is the Body seeking increase
Their relationship is so intimate and vital that none can be right itself without being rightly adjusted to the others
Consequently, they must move and act as one, for no matter what their specific functions and spheres, they are all in one Body
The importance of this principle cannot be over-emphasized, for without it everything is man-made, not God-created
