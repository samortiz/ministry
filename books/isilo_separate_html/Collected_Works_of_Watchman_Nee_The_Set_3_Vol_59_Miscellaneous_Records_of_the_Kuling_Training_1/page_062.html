Whoever has the gift has the ministry, and whoever has the ministry has the authority. For example, the eyes see. The seeing is the gift. The eyes have the gift of seeing, which means that they have the ministry of seeing. This also means that they have the authority of the ministry. The commission that one receives is the authority he inherits. When a man is commissioned to a work, he receives a ministry as far as he is concerned. But as far as others are concerned, he has become their authority. A man may be commissioned to manage a house; to him this is a ministry, but to others his ministry has become his authority. Anyone who enters the house has to obey him. Those who are commissioned have the authority. Those who have the ministry have the authority, and others have no choice but to obey them. The ministry with which God commissions a person becomes his authority, and it is right for others to acknowledge this authority. Today many people only see the relationship they have with the Head; they have not seen the relationship they have with other members; they have not seen how they should receive from one another. If you are a cell, you are directly related to the Head, but at the same time, there are other cells all around you; there is a relationship between you and them. Everyone likes to come under the direct authority of God, but God has arranged indirect authorities for us to practice our submission. Authority comes from many directions in the Body. If the brothers and sisters practice submission when they encounter ministry, there will be oneness and coordination.</p><h2 class="head1">A SUBMISSIVE LIFE</h2><p>It is very hard for God to make the world, the creatures in the universe, or the Israelites obey, because they do not have a life relationship with God. But it is easy for us to submit because we are related to God in life. Submission is God's nature; it is the very nature that God has given us. To us, it is a hard thing not to obey, because we are one in life. This is the same as saying that it is natural and spontaneous for the hands and legs to be harmonious with one another because they are one in life. It is hard for the hands and feet to fight each other. Receiving others' ministry is an easy thing. Conflict in the human body arises only when the body is sick. When the body is healthy, all the members are one. Schism in the body occurs only with schizophrenics. We feel right and comfortable when we submit because we are one Body in the Lord. Why do we not allow the Body of Christ to live a life of joy? Why must God's children fight and bicker with one another? Why must we criticize and destroy each other? This is against the very nature of our life. It is a matter of joy and rest for Christians to obey one another and to submit to one another.</p><h2 class="head1">ACKNOWLEDGING ONE'S LIMITATIONS<br />AND RECEIVING SUPPLY FROM THE BODY</h2><p>If we are submissive, we will not need to bear many burdens; the whole Body will bear these burdens for us. This will result in joy for the whole Body. Once we have tasted this experience, we will realize that we have never enjoyed something like this before in our whole life. It is a tiresome thing to bear all of our burdens alone. Perhaps we have not tired ourselves out yet. This is the reason we are still bearing our burdens. Many people have been bearing such burdens for years. They should have tired of them. Many people do everything by themselves. It is a tedious task for a member to bear the work of the entire Body. We have been working and bearing our own anxieties for years. Many burdens can be shared with others, and many works can be done by others. If we share our many burdens and works with the other members, it will become a light and easy thing for us to go on. We will thank God, saying, "Brother So-and-so can speak this, and Brother So-and-so can see that." As soon as a person accepts his limitations, he enters into rest. If a person who is an eye tries to be the leg, he will probably end up having insomnia. If he is an eye, he should give himself to only be an eye; let the legs run. Submission to the authority of the Body and mutual yielding of the members is a big release. To put it another way, it is a great burden for a person to try to do what he cannot do. We must all learn to accept our limitations. If we do, the Lord will put the greatest rest and joy before us. Otherwise, we will run over others and overtax ourselves when we try to usurp the place of others and do what we cannot do.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_061.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_063.html">Next</a> </body></html>
