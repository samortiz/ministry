The Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine truths as revealed in the holy Scriptures, the holy Word of God
The truths as revealed in the Scriptures have been lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught throughout the ages
The first crucial point of the major items of the Lord's recovery today is the divine revelation concerning the Triune God
Among Christians the truth concerning the Triune God has been lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught
In Genesis 1:1 the subject Elohim, used in relation to God's creation, is plural in number whereas the verb created is singular
The title Elohim, denoting the unique yet triune God, is used more than two thousand five hundred times in the Old Testament
The Father as the origin is the fountain; the Son as the expression is the spring; and the Spirit as the transmission is the flow
The Spirit as the flow is the reaching, the application, of the Triune God for the distribution of Himself into His chosen people
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the flowing into us of the grace of the Son with the love of the Father for us to enjoy
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three separate Gods but three stages of one God for us to possess and enjoy
The Scriptures tell us clearly and definitely that God is only one , yet He is also three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
In this passage we have the Father, the Spirit, and Christ the Son, showing again that all three exist together at the same time
The Father exists in the Son and the Spirit; the Son exists in the Father and the Spirit; and the Spirit exists in the Father and the Son
In the essential Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere at the same time and in the same way with no succession
The Father purposed , the Son accomplished , and the Spirit applies what the Son accomplished according to the Father's purpose
There is the need of the existence of the Divine Trinity, and there is also the need of the plan of the Divine Trinity
After this plan was made, the Son came to accomplish this plan, but He did this with the Father and by the Spirit
The Father is distinct from the Son, the Son is distinct from the Spirit, and the Spirit is distinct from the Son and the Father
The Lord Jesus as the child born in Bethlehem is the Mighty God, and the Lord Jesus who is the Son is also the Eternal Father
John 14:7-11 says, 'If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him
The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit
The Lord was made flesh and became the last Adam, and later, after death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit
The very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us, in our experience we sense that there is just One in us
The Lord charged us to baptize the nations 'into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
He said that those who approach this matter with confidence in their own mental power are 'the teachers of God, not His pupils'
Modalism in the second and third centuries passed through several changes and then reached its clearest expression with Sabellius
Even in Their economical works and manifestations, the three still remain essentially in Their coexistence and coinherence
Modalism stresses the side of God being one to a heretical extreme by denying the coexistence and coinherence of the three of the Godhead
The Bible is not at either of these extremes; it stands in the center, testifying of the twofoldness of the truth of the Divine Trinity
Regarding the truth of the Triune God, we also should be balanced and avoid the heretical extremes of both modalism and tritheism
Griffith Thomas in his book The Principles of Theology said concerning the Divine Trinity: 'The term Person is also sometimes objected to
Because the tritheists hold the side of the three and neglect the side of the one, they have no balance or safeguard
The term the consummated Spirit implies that the Spirit has been processed and thus has become the consummated Spirit
In the previous few decades the Lord has shown us the following points concerning His consummated, all-inclusive, and compound Spirit
All the above points that the Lord has shown us in the last few decades are great and crucial items in the Lord's recovery today
In the meantime, in the eighteenth century Zinzendorf recovered the practice of the church to some extent, but not in full
The oneness of the Body of Christ is the oneness of the Spirit and the oneness of the divine constitution by the Divine Trinity
The local ground of the church is basically the unique oneness of the Body of Christ practiced in the local churches
There is one unique Body of Christ in the whole universe, and there is one unique local church in each locality, respectively
The full knowledge of the Son of God is the apprehension of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience
To keep this aspect of the oneness we need to endeavor to 'drop all the minor and meaner doctrinal concepts that cause divisions
