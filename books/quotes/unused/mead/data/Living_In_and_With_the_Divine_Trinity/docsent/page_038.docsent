   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECOND CORINTHIANS 5:5-6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 5:5 and 6 show the Triune God having wrought us for our transfiguration; the Spirit having been given to us as the pledge; and we, at home in the body, being away from the Lord the Son .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word "wrought" is a difficult word to define.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God has wrought us for our transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "wrought" means fashioned, shaped, prepared, or made fit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God has wrought, fashioned, shaped, prepared, made us fit, for the very purpose that our mortal body might be swallowed up by His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This will be our transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word for "wrought" in the Chinese translation means to sow a seed into the soil and to water it that the seed may grow up to be a plant to blossom and to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order for the seed to fulfill its purpose of blossoming and bearing fruit, I have to work on it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, I put it into the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then I water it so that it can grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This makes it prepared to be in a proper form so that it can carry out my purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In like manner, God has wrought us for our transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we repented, believed in the Lord, and called upon His name, we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Triune God was put into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From the moment we were regenerated, God began to fashion us, to work us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God wants to use us to fulfill His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why we are still under God's working, God's fashioning, God's shaping.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We will be under God's working until the day that we will be fully matured.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The apostle Paul was eventually matured and ready to be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to allow God to work us until our mortal body is swallowed up by His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God needs to work us, to prepare us, to fashion us, and to fit us for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To work a piece of metal is to shape it by hammering it with tools.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the metal is wrought.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, there is nothing organic about working a piece of metal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God's working us is fully organic.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To sow something is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Watering helps this organic seed to grow as it gains the increase of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A piece of iron can be shaped and formed, but that is not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's shaping us is organic by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He shapes us by transforming us with the element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A piece of iron cannot be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can change its form, but that change is not transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Transformation is not merely an outward change but a change from within metabolically and organically.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the divine life grows and increases within us, we are transformed inwardly and organically.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is working us with Himself as the organic element added into our being that we may be transformed, not only in form but also in nature metabolically and organically.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His divine life is added into our being, and His life element is changing us as it is increasing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we will be shaped, formed, and fitted so that we can be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Different fruits have different kinds of shapes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>An apple, a banana, and a coconut all have different shapes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The shapes of such fruits are not arrived at by outward regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not need to make a round box to shape an apple.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, as the life of the apple grows, it spontaneously becomes formed into its life shape.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we plant a seed and water it, the life within it grows.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually, the life's growing shapes the fruit into a certain kind of appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the shape, the form, comes into being, not by outward regulation, such as hammering, but by the inward growing with the life element.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Each kind of fruit has its own shape according to the very essence of its element.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Similarly, we have the divine life, and this divine life has its own shape.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 2 Corinthians 5:5 and 6, Paul's thought is that we were made in the image of God, and God has added Himself into our being as a growing element.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now God is working us so that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The growing of this divine life within us will shape us into a certain form that fits our coming transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The teaching of 2 Corinthians is altogether a shaping teaching, a forming teaching, a working teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is working us to shape us, to form us, so that we may be fit for the up-coming transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today we are here under His shaping, His working.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The entire book of 2 Corinthians is a "working book."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is working us all day by day throughout our entire lives.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is working us in the same way that a farmer works a little plant day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually, the plant blossoms and bears fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Triune God has wrought us for our transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At our transfiguration our entire being will be saturated with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God has given us the Spirit as the pledge, the earnest, the foretaste, the guarantee, of this wonderful and marvelous part of His complete salvation for us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The pledge guarantees us that we will be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We will be transfigured by resurrection life swallowing the death in our mortal body 1 Cor 15:54 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Actually, our new body will be our old body which has been transfigured with the divine element under the divine working.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Presently, we are at home in the body and away from the Lord, the Son, until the day when He returns and we are raptured to meet Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we will all be home together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our home is the Triune God Psa 90:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By the divine element of the Triune God, we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are now growing day by day with this divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Eventually, this divine element, which is actually the Triune God Himself, will be our eternal dwelling place in our transfiguration.</S>
