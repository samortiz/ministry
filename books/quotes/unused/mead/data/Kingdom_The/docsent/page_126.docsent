   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>What then shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Don't say now that we should bind the strong man; that is the wrong weapon.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, keep yourself on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever you keep yourself on the cross, you will see that Satan is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By death Christ destroyed him that has the power of death Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the subtle one, Satan is not afraid of our binding, but he is afraid of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we remain on the cross, Satan will be terrified.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this short portion of the Word, we have two descriptions of Satan: the gates of Hades and the self in the mind with the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Don't think that only the gates of Hades is Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You must realize that the self also is Satan incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Peter became occupied by Satan because he forgot his spirit and exercised his mind, expressing his dissenting thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every dissenting thought is the incarnation of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Don't listen to any dissenting thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The best way to kill Satan is to put your dissenting thoughts on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May we all receive a clear vision!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is here and the church is here, but that subtle one, Satan, is also here.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your dissenting thoughts, like Peter's, may spring from a good intention, but you are nevertheless possessed by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As long as you cling to your dissenting opinions, you will either be obsessed or possessed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the local churches we all must be alert against any dissenting thought.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus told the disciples that He was going to Jerusalem to be killed and to be raised on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, Peter's dissenting mind stopped at the word "killed."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Dissenting ones seldom listen to other people to the end, so they seldom understand others to the full extent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because he was dissenting, he was shortsighted and missed the mark.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He heard the word "killed," but he missed the main point of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without crucifixion, there can never be resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the saints in the church life must be very careful about dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Never dissent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Dissenting is just the awful exercise of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regardless of your intention, as long as you are dissenting, you have been snared by the subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Don't think that you are so holy and so spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Within a very short period of time the Lord called Peter "a stone" and "Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The stone became Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may say that you love the church, and I have no doubt that you do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may feel that whatever you say is spoken with a good intention.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many dear saints have damaged the church and yet claim that they had a good intention, that they loved the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is not a matter of a good or bad intention.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You must ask yourself whether or not you are dissenting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Are you one with the church?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only oneness keeps you alive, and only oneness kills the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Tell the enemy: "Satan, I don't care for these reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I only care for the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I don't care about anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the sake of the Body I will not exercise my dissenting mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I will go to my spirit and stay there."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is what it means to take the cross.</S>
