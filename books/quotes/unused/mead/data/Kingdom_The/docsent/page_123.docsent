   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX FROM REJECTION TO GLORY 3 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:13-17, 18-19, 21-27, 28; 17:1-2, 3-5, 8</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to the last point of following the Lord Jesus during the time of His rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way to follow Him is to be absolutely outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 15 there was a Canaanite woman who was enjoying Christ as the crumbs in a living and nourishing way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>While this Gentile woman was enjoying Christ in such a way, the priests were worshipping in the temple, offering sacrifices and burning incense to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is very likely that these two things were occurring simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a Gentile land far away from the holy place, there was a Gentile woman who knew little about God, the Scriptures, the temple, the altar, the sacrifices, the priesthood, and the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although she knew little of these things, she was enjoying Christ as her nourishing food.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time, many priests who were trained in the proper worship of God were worshipping God according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In a sense, these priests had much knowledge about God and what they were doing in the temple was for God and toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose you had lived in the land of Israel at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Which side would you have taken the side of the priests worshipping in the temple or the side of the "Gentile dog"?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not believe that any of us, including myself, would have taken the side of the "Gentile dog."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We surely would have all joined the priests who were in the holy temple with the sacred Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the holy city everything was proper and nice, but in the Gentile world there was a Gentile woman who was considered as a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Would you join yourself to such a person?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Where was God at that time?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God was with a Gentile dog.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Strictly speaking, the Lord Jesus was God Himself, and He was with that woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was the very God whom the religious people were worshipping in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God was not with them in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was far away in a place which was considered unworthy of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The principle is exactly the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christianity as a religion worships God according to the Bible, but I am afraid that God is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is wherever the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And the Lord does not care about the outward situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He only cares for one thing that people will take Him into them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is completely different from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord did not tell the woman of Canaan, "You must learn how to worship Me. I am the very God of Israel." The Lord did not say such a thing, and He did not speak about anything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did not talk about worshipping God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, He talked about bread and about dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Isn't this strange?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once again we see that Christ is versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would follow the Lord Jesus during the period of His rejection, we must realize five basic things: Christ, the church, Satan, the cross, and the self including the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are five basic matters which we all must know while we are following Him in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of the kingdom people must be familiar with them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you remain in the "holy place," these five items cannot be revealed to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must leave Jerusalem, the holy place, and go to Caesarea Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You must leave that religious territory in order to see a vision of these five things.</S>
