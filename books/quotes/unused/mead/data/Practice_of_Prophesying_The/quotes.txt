[1]  CONTENTS The Basic Knowledge The Patterns The Basic Constituents of a Prophecy The Basic Obstacle to Prophesying PREFACE
[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in May and June of 1990 in a full-time training in Anaheim, California.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE BASIC KNOWLEDGE Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:3, 23-24, 4-5, 12, 31, 1, 39
[4]  The Bible is great, profound, mysterious, spiritual, and divine.
[5]  To prophesy is also to foretell, to tell beforehand, to predict.
[6]  Most of the chapters consist of speaking for God and speaking forth God.
[7]  AND THE EARNEST DESIRE TO PROPHESY All Believers Having the Capacity to Prophesy
[8]  Second, the composition of a prophecy comprises the utterance to speak forth what we know and have experienced of God, Christ, and the spiritual things.
[9]  The knowledge and the experience of God, Christ, and the spiritual things, the utterance to speak forth what we know and have experienced, and a clear view concerning our situation and environment are the basic preparation for our speaking.
[10]  If we use the contents of this book with the knowledge and experience of God, Christ, and the spiritual things, the utterance to speak forth what we know and have experienced, the sight under the divine enlightenment concerning our situation, and the instant inspiration of the indwelling Spirit through the clear and open fellowship with the Lord in the exercise of our spirit, we can easily compose a prophecy and speak it in the church meeting.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE PATTERNS Scripture Reading: Luke 1:39-45, 46-55
[12]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that whenever we come to Your Word, we meet You in Your presence.
[13]  THE PATTERN OF ELIZABETH'S PROPHESYING Living in the Presence of God
[14]  The contents of these seven verses imply that Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, lived in the presence of God and in the fellowship with the Lord, in a constant, continual communication with the Lord.
[15]  Being stirred up in her spirit, Elizabeth immediately received the instant inspiration of the Holy Spirit v. 41b , and she had the utterance by exercising her spirit v. 42a . Verse 42 says, "And she lifted up her voice with a loud cry." To speak loudly in such a way is to exercise the spirit.
[16]  In the meetings, often the brothers and sisters do not speak with boldness; that is, they do not speak loudly with the exercise of their spirit.
[17]  The Bible tells us that Christ is the seed Gen 3:15; 17:8; Gal 3:16 , the root Isa 11:10; 53:2; Rev 5:5; 22:16 , the tree John 15:1; Rev 2:7; 22:2 , and the branch Isa 4:2; Jer 23:5 , but without Elizabeth's blessing we would not know that Christ is also the fruit; we would lack one of the figures that describe what Christ is.
[18]  In verse 45, Elizabeth said concerning Mary, "There shall be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord."
[19]  OF A PROPHECY Scripture Reading: Matt 4:4, 7, 10; Rom 1:17; 3:4, 10-18; Matt 22:31-32; Heb 2:5-9; Acts 13:33; Gal 4:22-26; Eph 4:8-10; 1 Cor 14:26; Rev 1:11; Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4; Rom 15:16; 1 Pet 2:5, 9
[20]  The Lord's understanding of Exodus 3:6, revealed in Matthew 22:31-32, is an illustration of knowing the deep denotations of the word of God.
[21]  In brief, this denotation is that the Triune God, revealed in Genesis 1, so loved the serpentine people of the satanic world that He gave His only begotten Son, the Second of His divine Trinity, to them in incarnation to die for them in the form of a serpent as their Substitute and become the life-giving Spirit, that those who believe in Him as their Redeemer might be regenerated with His eternal life by Himself as the life-giving Spirit, to be the many sons of God John 1:12; Heb 2:10 and His many brothers Rom 8:29 to constitute His Body, the church Eph 1:23 , as His increase and His bride, to satisfy and express Him; this will be consummated in the New Jerusalem, as revealed in Revelation 21 22, to manifest the processed and consummated Triune God for the fulfillment of His eternal economy.
[22]  To have the personal knowledge of the Scriptures, we must also know the spiritual significances of the Word of God.
[23]  Paul's knowledge of the spiritual significances of the Word of God can be seen in his interpretation of Genesis 16:15 and 21:2, as revealed in Galatians 4:22-26.
[24]  The second basic constituent of a prophecy is the personal experience of life.
[25]  To prophesy is mainly to speak for God and Christ, to speak forth God and Christ, and to dispense God and Christ into people for people's nourishment and supply.
[26]  For many years Christians have read 1 Corinthians 14, but they have not had a way to carry out what is spoken in this chapter.
[27]  But, they did not see that in 1 Corinthians 14, to prophesy denotes only speaking for God and speaking forth God.
[28]  We have a speaking God, and this speaking God desires to have a speaking people.
[29]  God desires to speak, and His Spirit is waiting for us to speak.
[30]  If all the millions of Christians in the United States would speak for God and Christ every day, the whole earth would be overturned.
[31]  If we do not speak, God has no way to speak, but whenever we open up to speak, the Spirit who expects to speak immediately follows us and joins with our speaking.
[32]  We may not speak something for the Lord because we do not know how to speak, but if we do not go back home to learn how to speak, we will not speak the following week either.
