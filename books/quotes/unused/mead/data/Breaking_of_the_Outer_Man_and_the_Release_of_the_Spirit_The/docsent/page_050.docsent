   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Easy to Receive Edification</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The greatest help that we can receive does not come simply from the correction of our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The greatest help comes as our outer man is broken and our spirit becomes open and free.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When this happens, we will receive supply from others' spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our spirit will not only be released; it also will receive spiritual help wherever we go.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our outer man is not broken, it will be hard for us to receive any help from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose a brother is not broken in the outer man because his mind is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When this brother comes to the meeting, it will be hard for him to receive any edification.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unless a head-strong person is confronted with another strong mind, he will not receive any help from anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While other brothers are speaking, he will despise various thoughts, finding them too dull and dry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others will not be able to render him any help.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He may go on in the same way for a month, two months, a year, or two years without receiving any help at all.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has a shell in his mentality, and he can only receive help in the mental realm; he cannot receive any spiritual edification.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if the Lord steps into his situation and works on him repeatedly for one, two, or a few years, the shell of his mentality will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He will realize the futility of his mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He will become like a child, and it will be very easy for him to listen to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He will no longer dare despise others.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he listens to another brother, he will no longer try to catch flaws in his pronunciation, mistakes in his teaching, or ambiguities in meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He will instead touch the speaker's spirit with his own spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as the Lord moves a little in the speaker and his spirit is activated, the brother's spirit will be revived, and he will receive the edification.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a person's spirit is broken, whenever others release their spirit, he will receive edification.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He does not receive edification in doctrine only that is altogether a different matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more dealings a man's spirit receives from God, the more thorough will be the breaking of the outer man, and the more help he will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whenever the Spirit of God moves in a brother or sister, he will receive the help.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will no longer criticize others according to his doctrines or measure others according to the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will no longer pay attention to the nicety of the sermon, the eloquence of the speech, or the soundness of the interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His entire attitude will change.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The degree to which we can be helped by others depends on the condition of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Men often pass by us, but we cannot touch their spirit and cannot receive any edification from them because our shell is too thick.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is edification?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not the increase of thoughts, ideas, or doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Edification is when our spirit touches God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of God can come out of any man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether in the meeting or in private fellowship, we will experience the feeding and the reviving as soon as God's Spirit is activated in others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our spirit is like a mirror.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time we are edified, it is as if someone has polished our spirit a little and made it shine more.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The meaning of edification is nothing less than our spirit being touched by others' spirits or by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Holy Spirit touches our spirit through others' spirits, we receive edification.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What comes out of the spirit ignites us as soon as we touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are like an electric lamp that shines as soon as electricity passes through it, without regard to whether the lamp shade is red or green or whether the wires are white or black.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not care what the "lamp shade" is like; our attention is on the release of "electricity" and the fact that we have been revived, that we have been fed before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we can do this, we will become persons who can receive help easily.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is very hard for many people to receive help.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we want to help them, we have to exert much energy to pray and work on them before they will allow us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A hard person does not receive help easily.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Only those who are pliable will receive help easily.</S>
