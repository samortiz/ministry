   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE FIRST AND SECOND COMING OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Zech 9 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Lord's recovery there are three ministries: the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that in the prophethood there are two kinds of prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One is represented by Haggai, and the other by Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Haggai helped the people to be strong to work, while mentioning a little about Christ as the Desire of all nations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Zechariah followed to tell the people the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ministry of the prophet Zechariah is a ministry concerning Christ, showing that in God's recovery, Christ must have the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the books of the recovery Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah eventually there is nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The recovery is the recovery of the building of God's house, but it is for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>CHRIST IN THE FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first section of Zechariah shows us quite clearly that Christ is everything in God's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But Zechariah not only prophesies concerning Christ in the present, but also about Christ in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The last six chapters are occupied with this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These six chapters may be divided into two subsections, chapters nine through eleven and chapters twelve through fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first subsection, Zechariah prophesied concerning Christ as the anointed King, Who was rejected by the people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of course, this relates to the Lord's first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He came first as God's anointed, yet He was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the last subsection, the rejected King is welcomed as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>So Zechariah prophesied something concerning the first and second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church today in the recovery of the Lord must stand for these two comings of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must tell others how Christ came the first time and how Christ will come the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must not only tell that Christ has first place in God's recovery, but that He has two comings, the first and the second.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CHRIST REJECTED BY MAN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How did Christ come the first time, and how will He come the second time?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is shown clearly in the last section of Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Zechariah is a short, but deep book.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is easier to understand Isaiah than Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is easy to understand Isaiah 53, but not so easy to understand Zechariah 9 11.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock" Zech 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Who is this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, at that time it was Zechariah; but if we read on, we will see that it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ was sold for thirty pieces of silver this is mentioned in Matthew 26:14-16; 27:3-10.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>So it is Christ Who feeds the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why He said that He was the good Shepherd in the tenth chapter of John.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Zechariah 11:7 continues: "And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is better to translate the word "Beauty" into "grace."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us full of grace" John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Also, the word "Bands" should be translated into "unity."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ came with grace and unity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are His two staves as our divine Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He feeds us, we enjoy the grace; then we have the unity; we are just one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul loathed them, and their soul also abhorred me" Zech 11:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we read Matthew 16:21, we see that these three shepherds are the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These were the three kinds of shepherds among the people of God when the Lord Jesus came to the earth the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He came as the Shepherd to feed God's flock with grace so that they might have unity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But these three shepherds opposed Him; so the Lord cut them off.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"And my soul loathed them, and their soul abhorred me."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the elders, chief priests, and scribes abhorred the Lord because He cut them off.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They were not the shepherds, but the thieves!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And the people followed them to abhor the Lord; so He says, "I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the rest eat every one the flesh of another" Zech 11:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This was really fulfilled after the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Jewish race began to destroy one another.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"And I took my staff, even Beauty grace , and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>And the Lord said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly price that I was prized at of them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of the Lord" Zech 11:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to Exodus 21:32, a slave was priced at thirty pieces of silver.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ was priced as a slave, and Judas betrayed Him for this price.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord came as the Shepherd, but He was rejected, betrayed, and sold as a slave for thirty pieces of silver.</S>
