   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRESERVATIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What about the salt of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The function of salt is to preserve dead objects from turning stale and stinky.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If something is dead already and you apply salt, it is preserved from further corruption and decay.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many dead objects in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you look around, you will find all kinds of decaying things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They sit there rotting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Your presence as a Christian will stop these things from further deterioration.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our job is not to clean the house, scouring the world of all its filth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord never commissioned us to reform society or change the institutions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He only gave us authority to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are the salt of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are merely preventing the dead systems from further decay.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have no responsibility to reform them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SAVE THE MEN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The world is like a large old ship that is built of different materials.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is wood and metal.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But none of them is whole; every piece is corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The rudder is gone and the ship has run aground.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a big hole, and it may sink at any moment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The time is running out.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to decide whether you are going to save the ship or save the men on it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If there is enough time, you may be able to save both.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But there is not time for both to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Which one would you rescue?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our Christian attitude is that the ship is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is too old.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if it is saved, it is nothing but junk.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The engine is just a mess of scrap metal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No part can be salvaged.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We give up the ship and save only the men.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Get the people out and dispose of the container.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Besides, our Shipowner is building a bigger ship, a brand new one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That is the one we look forward to.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is our attitude towards the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We believe that there is absolutely no solution to the problems of the present system, governments, and society.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The only way is to ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The problems will be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the new heaven and new earth are inaugurated, the old order with all of its problems will be borne away.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today we do not take care of those problems.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We only save people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though society at large will be somewhat affected after individuals are saved, our commission is not to save the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>JESUS AS SAVIOR</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us look again at the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He never touched the question of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There were many Israelites who would have pledged Him their allegiance if He had proclaimed Himself King.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But He declined to assume that position.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Did He not have the power to revolutionize the system?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Could He not save His country?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He definitely could.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But He did not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He came to save individuals from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He died on the cross and resurrected only to deliver us from sins and give us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first coming of Christ was to accomplish the work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It delivers us from sin and dispenses life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He did not participate in social reforms.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But even today, some still see Him as a social reformer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, He never once instigated people to reorganize the government or stage a revolution.</S>
