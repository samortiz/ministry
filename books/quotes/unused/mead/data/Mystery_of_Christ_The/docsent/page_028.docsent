   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIRST CORINTHIANS 12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 12:4-30 is divided into four sections:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 Subject vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>4-6: Gift, ministry, and function.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2 The gifts of the Holy Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>7-11: The main emphasis being on the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3 The ministry of the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>12-27: The main emphasis being on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>4 The work of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>28-30: The main emphasis being on God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The beginning of every section points out the main divisions, while the theme can be seen in the subject of that section.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Gift is related to the Holy Spirit, whereas ministry is related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The bringing forth of the ministry is through the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The gifts are the vessels to perfect the ministries for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The goal of the gifts is to bring in the ministries, and through the ministries, the Christ that the church has learned, known, and gained is dispensed to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Most of the revival movements today have gifts but no ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is useless to exercise gifts all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to realize that gifts are secondary; the main thing is the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we have a ministry, we can serve the Body and cause the growth of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All the members of the Body of Christ mutually affect one another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If one member suffers, all the other members spontaneously suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes we feel strong because strength from other members has been transmitted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every member can affect the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why we should not live by ourselves but hold the Head and seek fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God conveys life to the Body through every member.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If life stops in you, you will not be able to supply others with life, and the church will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every individual failure causes damage to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a consequence, when one member suffers in the Body of Christ, all the members suffer with him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every member affects other members one way or another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, we have to be in the fellowship of the Body in everything we do.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have some good experiences, it is for rendering a supply to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are in some adverse condition, we must realize that this also affects other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>IN THE BODY, THROUGH THE BODY,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>AND FOR THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything we have is in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1925 Brother T. Austin-Sparks was invited to America.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He met a sister there who had learned many lessons through her illnesses and who had subsequently rendered much help to many people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She had a ministry of life and was a person who supplied others with life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The lessons she learned were learned in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the kind of person God is looking for today.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our living should be in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body; this should be our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May the Lord deliver us from individualism into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>May the Lord show us the Body, and may we serve His Body with a ministry which is based on our knowledge of Christ.</S>
