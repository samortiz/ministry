   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The reason God does not sanction the establishing of churches which combine companies of believers in different places is that the divinely-ordained basis for the forming of churches is thereby destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Any "church" formed with a mission as its center is bound to be other than local, because wherever there is a center, there is also a sphere; and if the center of the church is a mission, then obviously its sphere is not the scriptural sphere of locality but the sphere of the mission.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It clearly lacks the characteristic of a church, and can only be regarded as a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the purpose of God, Jesus Christ is the center of all the churches, and the locality is their sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever a special leader, or a specific doctrine, or some experience, or creed, or organization, becomes a center for drawing together the believers of different places, then because the center of such a church federation is other than Christ, it follows that its sphere will be other than local.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And whenever the divinely-appointed sphere of locality is displaced by a sphere of human invention, there the divine approval cannot rest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believers within such a sphere may truly love the Lord, but they have another center apart from Him, and it is only natural that the second center becomes the controlling one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is contrary to human nature to stress what we have in common with others; we always emphasize what is ours in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the common center of all the churches, but any company of believers that has a leader, a doctrine, an experience, a creed, or an organization as their center of fellowship, will find that that center becomes the center, and it is that center by which they determine who belongs to them and who does not.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The center always determines the sphere, and the second center creates a sphere which divides those who attach themselves to it from those who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anything that becomes a center to unite believers of different places will create a sphere which includes all believers who attach themselves to that center and excludes all who do not.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This dividing line will destroy the God- appointed boundary of locality, and consequently destroy the very nature of the churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the children of God must see to it that they have no center of union apart from Christ, because any extra-local union of believers around a center other than the Lord enlarges the sphere of fellowship beyond the sphere of locality, and thus the specific characteristic of the churches of God is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are no other churches in Scripture but local churches!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE BENEFITS OF INDEPENDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The divine method of making locality the boundary line between the different churches has various obvious advantages:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 If each church is locally governed, and all authority is in the hands of the local elders, there is no scope for an able and ambitious false prophet to display his organizing genius by forming the different companies of believers into one vast federation, and then satisfy his ambition by constituting himself its head.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rome could never sway the power it does today had the churches of God maintained their local ground.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Where churches are not affiliated, and where local authority is in the hands of local elders, a pope is an impossibility.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where there are only local churches, there can be no Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is the federation of different companies of believers that has brought such evils as dabbling in politics into the Church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is power in a federated "church," but it is carnal power, not spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's thought for His Church is that she should be like a mustard seed on earth, full of vitality, yet scarcely noticed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is federation that has brought the Church of today to the state of Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The failure of Protestantism is that it has substituted organized churches State and Dissenting for the Church of Rome, instead of returning to the divinely-ordained local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 Further, if the churches retain their local character, the spread of heresy and error will be avoided, for if a church is local, heresy and error will be local too.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rome is a splendid illustration of the reverse side of this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The prevalence of Romish error is because of Romish federation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The sphere of the federated churches is vast; consequently the error is widespread.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a comparatively simple matter to quarantine error in a local church, but to isolate error in a vast federation of churches is quite another proposition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>3 The greatest advantage of having locality as the boundary of the churches is that it precludes all possibility of sects.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may have your special doctrines and I mine, but as long as we are out to maintain the scriptural character of the churches by making locality the only dividing line between them, then it is impossible for us to establish any church for the propagation of our particular beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As long as a church preserves its local character, it is protected against denominationalism, but as soon as it loses that, it is veering in the direction of sectarianism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A believer is sectarian when he belongs to anyone or anything apart from the Lord and the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sects and denominations can only be established when the local character of the church is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the wisdom of God He has decreed that all His churches be local.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the divine method of safeguarding them against sects.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Obviously, it can only protect the Church against sectarianism in expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is still possible for a sectarian spirit to exist in a non-sectarian church, and only the Spirit of God can deal with that.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May we all learn to walk after the Spirit and not after the flesh, so that both in outward expression and inward condition the churches of God may be well-pleasing to Him.</S>
