The Divine Power Which Has Granted to Us<br>All Things Relating to Life and Godliness</H2><P>Another vital item as the base for our growth in life is the divine power which has granted to us all things relating to life and godliness (2 Pet. 1:3a). The divine power has given us all things that concern life and godliness. We desire to be holy, and we also aspire to be like God, that is, to be godly, because all things concerning these matters have been sown into us. Jesus as the Sower has sown Himself into us as the seed of holiness and godliness. The desire and aspiration for these things are included in that one seed. The tiny seeds of flowers are sown into the earth, and when they grow, they produce flowers of many different colors. In the same way, holiness, godliness, and all things that relate to life and godliness have been given to us. These things are all in us. If we do not seek holiness and godliness, we do not feel happy. But as long as we are seeking holiness and godliness, we are very happy, because within us we do have such a base.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Precious and Exceedingly Great Promises<br>and the Divine Nature</H2><P>The last items in Peter's writings as the base for our growth in life are the precious and exceedingly great promises and the divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4). In the New Testament there are hundreds of precious and exceedingly great promises. One such promise is found in Matthew 28:20: "And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age." Another great and precious promise is 2 Corinthians 12:9: "My grace is sufficient for you." There are many promises like these given to us in the New Testament.</P><P>In addition to these promises, we also have a share of God's divine nature. According to 2 Peter 1:4, it is through the precious and exceedingly great promises that we have become partakers of the divine nature. The matter of nature is very important. Hens lay eggs because it is according to their nature. The apple tree and all fruit trees bring forth fruit also by and according to their natures. This means that if we have a particular nature, we are able to do things that are by and according to that nature, and if we do not have a certain nature, we are not able to do things that are according to that nature. As believers in Christ, we have God's nature. How wonderful this is! We not only have God's life, but we also have His nature. We desire to be holy, godly, and spiritual because these things are according to God's nature, of which we partake. Because we have God's nature, to do the things of God is natural to us, because the divine things are according to our divine nature.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
