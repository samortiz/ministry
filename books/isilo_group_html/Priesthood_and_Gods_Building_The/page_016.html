<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE LIVING WATER OF LIFE AND<br />
GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>After God created man and placed him in the garden of Eden, the Scriptures speak of a river (Gen. 2:10). Following this, there are frequent references to a river in both the Old and the New Testaments. When the Bible refers to a river, there often is some connection with the temple of God. For example, Psalm 36:8 says, &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures.&rdquo; Psalm 46:4 says, &ldquo;There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God.&rdquo; Ezekiel 47:1 says, &ldquo;There was water flowing out from under the threshold of the house,&rdquo; and then verse 5 speaks of this flow becoming a river. Joel 3:18 speaks of a fountain that goes forth from the house of Jehovah. In John 4 the Lord spoke of living water that will flow from Himself into man (vv. 10, 14), and in chapter 7 He said that this water would become rivers of living water (v. 38). Of the four Gospels, only the Gospel of John speaks of the Lord being the temple of God (2:18-21). Hence, like the verses in the Old Testament, which speak of water flowing out of the temple, the verses in John 7 also speak about the water of life flowing out of the Lord as the temple of God. Even at the end of the Bible, there is a river of water of life that proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). This river flows out of the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb, who are the temple of God (21:22). Referring to verse 22, some people may say that there is no temple in the New Jerusalem, but this verse clearly states that the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple. Since the river of water of life is flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb, it is also flowing out from the temple of God.</p>
<p>These verses show that a flowing stream, a river, is closely related to the temple and the city of God. This river is the lifeline of God&rsquo;s temple, God&rsquo;s city. If this river did not exist, God&rsquo;s temple, God&rsquo;s city, would not have life, and there would be no circulation of life or watering of life. The importance of a river to God&rsquo;s dwelling place can be likened to the importance of a city&rsquo;s water supply. The primary concern of the human population of any city is to have a supply of water. Water is more necessary and crucial than food. In human society water, which is more necessary and crucial than food, serves to water outwardly, to quench thirst inwardly, and to cleanse. To live in a city, we need water; otherwise, even the air that we breathe would be dry and unbearable. More importantly, we need water every day to quench our thirst and to live. Finally, we need to cleanse ourselves daily with water to wash away our filth. A city that is short of water will be dry, filled with death, and filthy.</p>
<p>Similarly, in God&rsquo;s city, God&rsquo;s temple, water is also needed. In the Bible the temple and the city both emphasize the aspect of dwelling. In the Old Testament the city refers to the outlying area of the temple, but at the end of the New Testament the city becomes the enlargement of the temple. In Jerusalem the city surrounds the temple. In the New Jerusalem God dwells directly in the city. In other words, the city has become the temple; it has become the enlargement of the temple. The New Jerusalem, either as a city or as an enlarged temple, refers to the saved ones who are gathered together to be the dwelling place of God. Since it is a city filled with people, there is the need for a flow and supply of water. This is the reason that the Bible associates God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s city with a flowing river.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:10 contains the first reference to a river in the Bible, and it speaks of the river watering the garden. Hence, according to the Bible, the first function of a river is for watering. The first function of water in God&rsquo;s dwelling place is to water people. When the Bible further speaks of water, it is for the purpose of giving people a drink to quench their thirst. Although Genesis 2 does not use the word <em>drink,</em> the intrinsic significance of water is for man to drink. This can be seen from the context of verses 9 and 10. Since the emphasis in verse 9 is on eating the tree of life, the emphasis in verse 10 must be on drinking of the river that went forth from Eden to water the garden. Throughout the Scriptures, rivers are associated with drinking. Psalm 36:8 speaks of drinking of the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures, and in John 7:37-38 the Lord spoke of coming to Him and drinking so that rivers of living water would flow out of those who believe into Him. These verses emphasize drinking. At the end of the Bible, Revelation 22:1 speaks of a river of water of life, and in 21:6 the Lord spoke of giving to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely. Finally, 22:17 says, &ldquo;Let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; All these verses clearly indicate that the river of water of life is for people to drink and to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>Watering relieves outward dryness, whereas drinking relieves an inward thirst. It is the function of a river to water and to quench thirst. This is the reason that the Bible speaks of a river of pleasures that gladdens the city of God and that makes God&rsquo;s dwelling place joyful (Psa. 36:8; 46:4). We all know that a person who is dry outwardly and thirsty inwardly is not joyful. According to the Bible, thirst is the most severe suffering that a person can experience. In Luke 16:24 the rich man who was suffering in Hades longed to have his tongue cooled by a little water from the tip of Lazarus&rsquo;s finger. It is a happy matter when a man&rsquo;s thirst is quenched. In addition, Revelation 22:1 speaks of this river as being a river of water of life, a river that gives people life. Since life is always versus death, the river of water of life solves the problem of death. Thirst is the herald of death. When the problem of thirst is solved, the problem of death is solved.</p>
<p>If we consider all these points, we can see clearly that in God&rsquo;s city, God&rsquo;s temple, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the first crucial matter is the flowing of the river. When we speak of the building of the church, we must realize that the living of the dwellers and the work of building cannot be maintained without the flowing of water. If we desire to accomplish the work of building the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the most urgent thing is to let the water of life flow so that there will be a full supply for our spiritual life and living. When the water of life flows in God&rsquo;s dwelling place, it waters the dwellers, quenches their thirst, and washes them of any filth. These functions enable every person in God&rsquo;s dwelling place to be refreshed, living, and clean, without any hint of dryness, death, or filth.</p>
<p>In addition to watering, quenching thirst, and cleansing, the flow of the river produces gold, pearl, and precious stones. This is the picture presented in Genesis 2:10-12. The flowing of the river not only refreshes God&rsquo;s people in their life and living, but it also produces materials for God&rsquo;s building. Hence, when we speak of building the church, we must pay attention to the flow of living water. If living water cannot flow freely, the life and living of God&rsquo;s people cannot be maintained, and there will be no producing of building materials. Instead, the only result will be death and filth. However, when the water of life flows freely, the situation in the church will be full of life, bright, and pure as crystal, and the precious materials needed for the building will be produced. If we want to maintain God&rsquo;s temple and to sustain God&rsquo;s city, the river of water of life is absolutely indispensable. Similarly, if we want the church to be built up as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, there must be a flow of living water.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
