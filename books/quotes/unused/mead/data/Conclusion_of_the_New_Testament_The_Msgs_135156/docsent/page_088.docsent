   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b Husbands Loving Their Own Wives as Christ Loving the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 5:25 says, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Colossians 3:19 says, "The husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter against them."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul exhorts the husbands to love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The opposite of subjection is ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, Paul does not exhort the husbands to rule over their wives but to love them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In married life, the wife's obligation is subjection, and the husband's is love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The wife's subjection plus the husband's love constitutes proper married life and typifies the normal church life, in which the church is subject to Christ and Christ loves the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By being filled in spirit and saturated with the word of Christ, husbands are to love their wives "as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A husband's love for his wife must be like Christ's love for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that a husband ought to give himself up for his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To give yourself up is to be a martyr, to sacrifice your life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Husbands are to love their wives at such a cost to themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They must be willing to pay a great price, even to die for their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Ephesians 5:28 Paul goes on to say, "The husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He who loves his own wife loves himself."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Here Paul twice speaks of husbands loving their own wives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that a husband is to love his wife without comparing her to others.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, the husbands are to love their own wives as their own bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A husband should regard his wife as part of his body and care for her as his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 29 continues, "For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We show love for our body by nourishing and cherishing it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To nourish is to feed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Spiritually speaking, husbands are to nourish their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as we eat for the sake of our body, so husbands need to take in something of the Lord for the sake of their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In doing this a husband regards his wife as part of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A husband needs to nourish his wife, to take care of her need, just as he takes care of the need of his body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the meaning of "nourish" in verse 29.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Husbands should also love their wives as their own bodies by cherishing their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To cherish is to nurture with tender love and foster with tender care.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To cherish something is to care for it deeply and warmly; it is to soften it through tender warmth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the way Christ cares for the church as His Body, and this is the way husbands should love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we see the depth of the love a husband must have for his wife. c Children Obeying Their Parents in the Lord and Honoring Them</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 6:1 says, "The children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Colossians 3:20 says, "The children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In these verses Paul does not speak simply of children but of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By using the definite article before children Paul indicates that the children of believers are not common.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are different from the children of people in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the particular children, those in the families of believers, are exhorted to obey their parents in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The phrase "in the Lord" indicates obedience to the parents by being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It also indicates that this should not be done by self-effort but by the Lord, and not according to the natural concept but according to the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The children of believers should realize that they are to obey their parents by being one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, they are to obey their parents not by their own strength but by the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Their obedience is to be according to the Lord's word, according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Ephesians 6:2 and 3 Paul goes on to say, "Honor your father and mother, which is the first commandment with a promise, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long on the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not only the first commandment with a promise but also the first commandment concerning man's relationship with man Exo 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The promise, mentioned in verse 3, is that it may be well with the children and that they may live long on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The first part of the promise is related to prosperity in material blessings; it also refers to living in a peaceful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The second part is to have longevity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to this commandment, prosperity and longevity are God's blessings in this life to those who honor their parents.</S>
