   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUMMARY OF PSALM 110</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have covered the first four Psalms of Book V, Psalms 107 to 110.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Of these, Psalm 110 is the climax.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In fact, no other Psalm is higher than Psalm 110 regarding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a short Psalm with only a few main points, but these points are immensely significant.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first is that Christ is sitting at the right hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This refers to His exaltation and enthronement.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The significance of this verse is seen in the fact that it is mentioned approximately twenty times in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even the Lord Jesus Himself quoted this verse frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is profitable to look into all these New Testament quotations: there are some in the first three Gospels, some in the Acts, some in Ephesians, some in 1 Corinthians, and many in Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second point in this Psalm is the victory of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has won the victory, and He is going to win many more victories.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact that God has promised to make all His enemies His footstool is an aspect of His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The third point is His power, His authority, His scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is the exalted One, the enthroned One, the Victor, and the One who has the scepter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The rod is in His hand v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fourth point is that Christ is still fighting, and He will fight to the end. In verse 3 we have this phrase: "In the day of thy power." The word "power" in this phrase has another meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The margin of the American Standard Version says, "in the day of thy army," and the Goodspeed translation has "on your day of war."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not only the day of His power, but also the day of His fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is then that the people will offer themselves willingly in the splendor of their consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is then that the young men will be as the dew out of the womb of the morning and as the brook on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ needs refreshment because He is fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On one hand this Psalm tells us He has won the victory, but on the other hand He is still fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will fight to the end. So many things may be realized from this short Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fifth point is that He is today the Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the King, He is the Warrior, and He is also the Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is a Priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but in the power of an endless life Heb 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not realize how much He prays for us, how much He is sustaining us all the day long, by being our Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is there at God's right hand as the King to care for God's interest in the entire universe; He is there as the Priest to care for us; and He is also there as the Warrior, fighting against His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The sixth point is that He will eventually return.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is clear, by combining all these six points, that Psalm 110 is the highest peak in the revelation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ today, according to Psalm 110, is at the right hand of God, the highest place in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews 1:3 says that He "sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high," the highest place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Psalm 110 tells us not only where Christ is, but also what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is the King, He is the Victor, He is the Warrior, He is the Priest, and He is the Coming One at least these five items.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In such a short Psalm of seven verses we see all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Psalm, which gives the highest revelation of Christ, is not in the first book, but in the last book of the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Book V, we reach the highest peak.</S>
