With our human mentality we cannot fathom them. In the early days of my Christian life I simply could not understand how they fit in or what they were trying to say. Yes, these chapters are about the New Jerusalem, but what is the New Jerusalem?<h2 class=head2>The Tabernacle of God</h2><p>Revelation 21:3 describes the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of God. To understand the meaning of the tabernacle we must refer to the Old Testament.<p>At first there was no tabernacle. Adam was created; then he fell. After him there was Abel, then Enoch, then Noah, and then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Noah was a great man, enjoying God&#8217;s blessing, but there was no tabernacle in his day. Like Abraham, he dwelt in a tent.<p>One day God in the form of man came to visit Abraham. Genesis 18 says that Abraham received Him as a guest outside his tent. There was no tabernacle; God came to that place just for a visit.<p>In later years Abraham&#8217;s grandson, Jacob, was on his way to his uncle&#8217;s, fleeing from his brother and feeling sorrowful and desolate. When he lay down to sleep, &#8220;he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it&#8221; (Gen. 28:12). When he awoke, &#8220;he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven&#8221; (v. 17). He called that place Bethel, the house of God (v. 19). But Jacob&#8217;s experience of the house of God was only a dream. Instead of entering the house of God, he and his kinfolk ended up in Egypt, where Jacob died.<p>In Exodus God sent Moses to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt to a place where they would build Him a tabernacle (Exo. 3:10; 25:8). Exodus shows us that God&#8217;s salvation delivers from the bondage of the world to His tabernacle. The ultimate consummation of salvation is God&#8217;s tabernacle, which is His very home. Not only God dwelt there; the priests who served also lived there. They and God lived in the same home.<p>Have you ever asked God, &#8220;Where is Your home?&#8221; Have you ever asked where your own home is? Your home must be God&#8217;s home. Where God dwells, there you should also dwell. Unless God is dwelling with you, you should not consider any place your home. Because you are a priest, you should live in God&#8217;s home. That home in the Old Testament was the tabernacle.<p>In the conclusion of the Bible a city appears. A voice out of the throne declares that this city is the tabernacle of God (Rev. 21:2-3).<p>The tabernacle of Moses was a miniature, prefiguring this true tabernacle. The first tabernacle was only fifteen feet wide (ten cubits), forty-five feet long (thirty cubits), and fifteen feet high. It was much smaller than one of our three-bedroom houses today. It was small, but nonetheless it was God&#8217;s home on this earth. He lived there for about forty years in the wilderness and for more than four centuries in the promised land. It was a movable house, without floors and without a foundation. Furthermore, only the priests were qualified to enter that home and stay there with God.<p>The New Jerusalem is the fulfillment of this type. How great a tabernacle this is! Its height, breadth, and length are all the same-twelve thousand stadia or about fourteen hundred miles. Have you ever seen any house that big? The type was small, but the fulfillment is bigger than we can imagine.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> </body></html>
