   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DRINKING OF THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT WHO DWELLS IN US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The traditional theology of today s fundamental Christianity is not altogether accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we should not remain in it but should return to the pure Word of God to see that our Jesus, whom God is working into us, is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This means that all that Christ is in many items and aspects is being wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God does not intend that we keep the Sabbath, the law, the ordinances, or many other items of practice.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Neither is it that we hold to a religion with its teachings and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God s intention is to work Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may compare Christ as the Spirit to an all-inclusive drink with many healthy ingredients combined together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have all been given to drink one Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this all-inclusive Spirit whom we drink is God, the Father, the Creator, the man Jesus, the Lamb of God, the Redeemer, the Savior, life, love, light, wisdom, power, sanctification, holiness, and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we drink of Him by calling, O Lord Jesus, we take in every positive item v. 3b .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Holiness is not a kind of sinless perfection, as John Wesley taught.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, holiness is Christ, who is our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Life, holiness, comfort, and consolation are all Christ, who is the all-inclusive Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we are troubled, tested, and suffering, we need consolation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At these times we need to call, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we will experience true consolation and refreshment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jesus is so many items to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a mother is troubled by her children, or a wife by her husband, she simply needs to take Jesus as her all-inclusive drink.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one but Jesus can truly solve our problems, answer our questions, or be our true consolation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need to take a drink of the all-inclusive Christ by calling, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I am frequently asked by the churches to give a conference, and very often I am not clear as to what I should minister.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At these times I do not merely consult with certain books.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, I take a few cups of Jesus as the all-inclusive drink by calling on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I become clear, and I receive something to minister to people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s purpose is to work the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>BECOMING THE CHURCH BY BEING ONE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The proper church life comes not out of religion, ordinances, and the law but from the very Christ whom we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the book of Galatians, church and churches are mentioned only in chapter 1 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Practically speaking, however, this book uses a number of synonyms for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 28 of chapter 3 says, You are all one in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This oneness is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As the church, we are all one by being baptized into Christ and putting on Christ v. 27 . However, today s Christianity is fully divided by ordinances, doctrinal teachings, and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In ordinances we are different and divided.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some hold to the practice of foot-washing, head covering, and certain forms of baptism, whereas others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Similarly, some hold to particular teachings concerning many matters, and others do not hold the same teachings; moreover, some practice certain gifts, but others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Differing ordinances, opinions, teachings, and gifts are all causes of division.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In His recovery the Lord will deliver many people from their divisions in differing ordinances, doctrines, traditions, practices, and gifts to practice the oneness in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We all need to remain in Christ and care only for Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE LAW BEING A GUARDIAN AND A CHILD-CONDUCTOR</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>TO BRING US TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 14 says that we have received the promise of the Spirit through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This Spirit is Christ, into whom we have been baptized and whom we have put on v. 27 . We can be baptized into Christ because, as the Spirit, He is the living water into whom we are immersed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now we all are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Judaizers might have asked, What then is the purpose of the law, and why did God give it to us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The law was given as a guardian before Christ came in order to keep His chosen people, just as a sheepfold keeps the flock safe at night, during storms, and in the winter John 10:1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Eventually, when Christ came, the law functioned as a child-conductor to bring people to Him Gal 3:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the ancient days a guardian cared for a child who was under age and conducted him to the schoolmaster.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The law kept God s people before Christ came and conducted them to Him after His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At this point the law was finished and had no further position.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Accordingly, there is no further need for religion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we should no longer hold to the law, ordinances, and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today we have only Christ as our living Teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are in Him, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>AND BEING DEAD TO THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the law was rightly used, it served as a guardian and a child-conductor, as revealed in Galatians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the negative sense, however, the law was a concubine, illustrated by Hagar in chapter 4.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Both the position and the function of a concubine are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The law should be only a guardian and a child-conductor; it should never bring forth children.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Once the law produces children, it becomes a concubine, and what she produces are not children of promise but children unto slavery vv.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>24, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 30 says, Cast out the maidservant and her son.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is to cast out the law with all that the law produces.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Paul tells us that the allegory of the two women portrays two covenants, the covenant of grace and the covenant of law.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first covenant, that of grace and portrayed by Sarah, was given to Abraham, to whom God preached the gospel 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then after more than four hundred years, the second covenant, that of the law and portrayed by Hagar, was given at Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God did not acknowledge Ishmael, the son produced by Hagar, and He did not recognize him as a proper heir.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, He told Abraham to cast out the maidservant and her son.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God acknowledged only Isaac, the one who was begotten of Sarah according to the promise, as the one who would inherit the promised blessing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may illustrate the principle of the two covenants as follows.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Ephesians 5:22 says, Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord, and verse 25 continues, Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After reading this, a husband may make up his mind to endeavor to love his wife, and to some extent he may be able to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Similarly, after reading verse 22 a sister may endeavor to submit to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>She may tell her husband, Whatever you say, I will do it, and if you don t agree, I will not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For a certain period of time she too may be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, the husband s love and his wife s submission are Ishmael, not Isaac, because they are produced according to the principle of law.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Such love and submission may be real, just as Ishmael was a real child, but God will say, Cast them out.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If our eyes are opened to see this, we will realize that God rejects not only hatred and rebellion but also the love and submission that come out of the self trying to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should not think that there are only ten commandments in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Many Christians have converted almost the entire New Testament into commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Where then is the real experience of Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A certain brother may not know how to interpret Ephesians 5:25, but he realizes that Jesus is in him, and he knows how to drink the living Spirit by calling, O Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In this way, Christ as love spontaneously flows out of him to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the genuine experience of Isaac, symbolizing the children of promise born out of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The law was not intended to be kept.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we try to keep the law, we misuse it and make it a concubine to produce an Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The law was simply meant to be a guardian and a child-conductor to keep us and to bring us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once this is accomplished, we can say good-bye to the law, because it has no further position and function.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are dead to the law, and we are living to God Gal 2:19 .</S>
