Chapter one was a message given to the saints in the training on July 8 and chapters two and three were fellowship with the elders on July 9
Because of our human nature, troubles arise after we are in contact with one another for a longer period of time
These are not natural virtues, but they are the divine attributes expressed in our humanity to be our human virtues
With our body presented, our mind renewed, and our spirit burning, we can know the will of God , which is to live the Body life
If we are going to have the proper Body life, the church life, we must learn how to embrace all the differences between Christians
In the local churches, there are saints from many different countries and cultures, and this issues in many differences
Although ninety-five percent of the saints were Chinese, they spoke Mandarin, a common Chinese dialect, with many different accents
After almost forty years of practicing the church life in Taiwan, however, the differences have been nearly swallowed up
He just indicated that those who keep a certain day, keep it to the Lord; and those who do not keep a certain day, do this to the Lord
Also, we have to receive them in a willing way, and we have to love them with the same love with which we love others
When we first began the church life in our locality, everything was wonderful and it seemed easy to keep the oneness
After remaining in this locality for a number of years, things can rise up within and among us to damage the oneness
Our living and our behaving must be worthy of the Lord's table, or we will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord
If we sense that we are not approved, we can make a thorough confession of our sins, wrongdoings, shortcomings, and failures
If we eat the bread and drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, we eat and drink judgment to ourselves
In discerning the Body of Christ, we should not partake of the bread in any division or with any divisive spirit
We may feel that we have been approved to partake of the table, but we are concerned about others who have been committing sins
We must remember that Paul's word in 1 Corinthians 11 tells us to prove ourselves, to test ourselves for approval
As you are enjoying Christ as the sin-dealing life, you must have the capacity to bear away the iniquity of God's people
To minister Christ as the sin-dealing life to someone is not to go to him to point out his fault and condemn him
The very Christ as life will be actually, really, and richly ministered to him, and this life, which is the Spirit, will work within him
Galatians 6:1 says that when a brother is overtaken in some offense, those who are spiritual should restore him
If you two can work together for half a year to get this sinful brother recovered, this is a great, great help to the church life
We should not talk about a sinful saint but pray for him and try to minister the very Christ whom we enjoy to him
As long as someone is a saint, he is a member in the church, and we should love him with the same love that we love the other saints
Now that we have seen the crucial matter of keeping oneness in love, we want to study the Word concerning God's administration on this earth
Through His move in the book of Genesis, God gained some important persons and eventually He gained the house of Israel
In Exodus 19 at Mount Sinai the Lord told the children of Israel that He wanted them to be a 'kingdom of priests' and a 'holy nation'
They did not come out of Egypt one by one as individuals, but they came out as a corporate people, even as a nation and a kingdom
Among the children of Israel, these agents were the priests and the elders working together for God's theocracy
The law, like the United States Constitution, may be considered as the first written constitution of God's people written by God Himself
The very crucial part in God's government was God's instant speaking through the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate of the high priest
Although the Scripture does not clearly indicate how the elders were produced, it does tell us how the priests were produced
On the breastplate with the additional piece called the Thummim, all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet could be found
According to this article, the Urim, which means light, was an illuminator inserted into the breastplate underneath the twelve stones
When the priest went into God's presence with the breastplate, suddenly a stone inscribed with a certain name became dark
The writer of this article said that it was through the Urim and the Thummim that the sin of Achan was discovered in Joshua 7
The breastplate of the high priest is called the breastplate of judgment in Exodus because it speaks for God instantly
After the high priest received the instant speaking from God, he did not directly execute or carry out what God spoke
He passed on the word he had received to the elders, and the elders became the direct administrators among God's people
When the priests became weak, such as at the time of Eli , the prophets were raised up to strengthen God's speaking
The instant speaking was either through the priests or the prophets, but neither the priests or the prophets were the direct administrators
There is also not a direct word in the New Testament to tell us how the first group of elders in the New Testament church was produced
Either through seeing the Lord's death or through the appearing of the Lord to him in His resurrection , James believed in the Lord
When the apostle Paul was raised up by the Lord and sent out by the Holy Spirit, the Lord used him to establish new churches
Acts 14:23 tells us that Paul returned to appoint elders in each of these new local churches probably within the same year
The elders were established among the saints by the apostles who had preached the gospel to them and had formed them into a local church
Titus 15 tells us that the apostles who established the churches had the position and the right to send a representative to establish elders
These apostles should be the ones who appoint the elders to carry out God's administration in each local church
At the very beginning of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, we adopted at least eighty percent of the Brethren's practice
By 1935 we realized that we could not fully follow them because we realized their serious mistake in the matter of the church practice
When Brother Nee began to see the light concerning the scriptural practice of the church life, he was still somewhat held by our humility
He said Today we are the unofficial apostles yet the unofficial apostles still have the unofficial right to appoint the unofficial elders
After a short time, another book was published in Chinese by Brother Nee entitled The Normal Christian Church Life
He said that if those of us who preach the gospel, teach the truth, and establish and form churches are not the apostles, then who are?
We have seen that in the Old Testament, the law could be considered as the written constitution of God's people
We know that Christ replaced the law, but we are referring to the aspect and sense of replacing the law in God's administration
The first group of apostles were charged by the Lord Jesus to teach the new believers what the Lord had taught them
The teaching of the apostles also includes what is recorded in the Acts, the Epistles, and the book of Revelation
At the conclusion of the book of Revelation, John tells us that no one should add anything or take away anything from the divine revelation
If you add something, you will suffer the plagues; and if you deduct something, you will suffer the loss of the divine blessing
The entire New Testament which is the complete teaching of the apostles must be considered as the constitution of Gods New Testament kingdom
Paul, in his first Epistle to the Corinthians, made this matter of God's administration in the New Testament very clear
By the New Testament teaching and example, we can realize that some elders had been established in the church in Corinth
If there is a problem in the church, we have to come to the New Testament to see what it says about this particular problem
We should not say we are for or against something until we go to the New Testament constitution to see what it has to say
When any problem arises, we must learn to be silent and go to the written Word of God, the New Testament constitution, without any opinion
We have to get into the presence of the Lord, stay in His presence, and wait on Him, asking Him to show us what to do
As an elder, you have the High Priest within you, and you can share in His loving capacity as symbolized by His breast
Besides the elders as the priests and as the administrators, there are the prophets and teachers as illustrated in Acts 13:1-4
After the apostles appoint the elders and commit the church into the hands of the elders, what shall the apostles do in the future?
We saw that Paul wrote a letter to the church in Corinth charging them to remove a certain sinful man from the fellowship of the church
In this sense Paul as an apostle kept his hands off of the church administration but not from teaching instructing and charging the church
There is another aspect to the apostles' relationship with a local church, which Brother Nee talked to us about, in 1 Timothy 5
Timothy 5:19-20 says, 'Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses
Corinthians 11:34 says, 'If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment
Even after charging the church to take care of so many things, Paul says that he will set in order the remaining matters when he comes
All the states of the United States have their own administrations and governments, but they are not strictly independent
When the apostles kept their hands off of the affairs of the churches this did not mean that each local church became one independent entity
Concerning this matter, we need to look at the seven epistles to the seven local churches in Revelation 2 and 3
Every epistle was a particular word to a certain church, yet this particular word should be heard and taken by all the churches
On the other hand, all the local churches are still the one Body of Christ which is an organism, not a federation which is an organization
We have the leadership of one controlling revelation in the one ministry through those who bring in the revelation of the ministry
Paul was very burdened to help the Corinthians solve their problems, and their problems involved him and Apollos
Paul was not the leader in the New Testament move of God in the sense of commanding the co-workers to do things
In 1 Timothy 1:3-4, Paul urged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach differently from God's New Testament economy
The aged Apostle John, in his second Epistle, told the saints not to receive anyone who brings a teaching other than the teaching of Christ
They went beyond the teaching concerning Christ, which is the basic teaching of the New Testament, the teaching of the apostles
He did a work in his own rented dwelling to proclaim the kingdom of God and to teach the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ
After such a training, they may decide to go back to continue their schooling, or they may go back to get a job
Of course, by having such a training, some will be tested out and approved to be life-long, full-time servants of the Lord
Sixty-six years have passed and we have not seen a model of a local church built up entirely according to what we have seen from the Lord
A driving teacher can impart the principles of driving to his students and even some details, but his teaching is not the application
Far, according to my observation, many of the leading ones are still building up the local churches in a 'probing way'
They heard something and they received some teaching, but in their practice they are not so clear what to do or how to do it
Maybe after a short time, some would find out that they were not suitable persons for the eldership and they would feel to resign
My negligence was in accepting these saints to be trained and not doing anything to prepare the training to fit in with their situation
We discovered that we could baptize many people, but then we realized that we did not have the manpower to take care of the new ones
We do not have any basic problems among us, so it should be easy for us to avoid speaking differently and speak the same thing
We should mean business with the Lord that the Lord's recovery will be prevailing and even flourishing on this earth for the Lord's purpose
We should try to avoid different kinds of terms, slogans, and sayings, and try our best to keep the oneness in the Lord's recovery
If a local church has a burden to visit people in their homes for the preaching of the gospel, they should carry out this commission
How can you have fellowship about these genuine concerns without being considered by others as negative and thereby causing another problem?
We come from different countries with different backgrounds, and we have different kinds of understanding and thinking
If you feel or observe something concerning the Lord's recovery related to a certain person, you should pray for him
We should be afraid that we would do something in a rush to damage someone's feeling and close the door for open fellowship
Before we go to see him, we should not say anything to anyone because this kind of 'pre-talk' opens the door for the devil to come in
We all have a heart for the Lord, and we all have the same goal to see that the Lord's recovery would be properly going on
Even with what we say to our wives, we must exercise our wisdom in order to have a marriage life with a peaceful and sweet feeling
If there are three elders in a certain locality, these brothers also need to exercise their wisdom in what they say to one another
If you, as one of the three elders, see some problems with the saints, do not talk to the other two brothers right away
They may not become negative themselves or cause some trouble, but the symptom in many cases is that they become discouraged
There are many cases where this causes them to question the leadership in their church or the ministry among us
That caused the church in Shanghai to close its doors and also caused Brother Nee to stop his ministry for six years
Why is it that after condemning him and saying negative things about him, your spiritual life has become so poor'?
Whether the thing you heard is true or not, as long as your hearing has a negative influence on your spiritual life, you should not take it
