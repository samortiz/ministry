<h2 class="head2">The Case in John 5</h2>
<p>John 5 describes the condition of a man who is dead in religion. Although the Jewish religion had the holy city, the holy temple, and the Holy Scriptures, as well as religious feasts, a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered were lying by the five porticoes of a pool near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem, waiting for the water to be moved by an angel (vv. 2-3). The blind could not see, the lame could not walk, and the withered were half dead. This speaks of man&rsquo;s condition in dead religion. If the Lord Jesus had come to such ones in dead religion and had majestically said, &ldquo;I am God; you should worship Me,&rdquo; the blind would have said, &ldquo;I would like to worship You, but how can I worship when I cannot see?&rdquo; The lame would have said, &ldquo;I would like to worship You, but how can I worship when I am lame?&rdquo; and the withered would have said, &ldquo;I would like to worship You, but how can I worship when I cannot get up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thank God that the Lord Jesus did not come as such a God. Instead, He went to a man who had been a paralytic for thirty-eight years and said softly, as an ordinary man would, &ldquo;Do you want to get well?&rdquo; (v. 6). The man sorrowfully said, &ldquo;Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me&rdquo; (v. 7). Dead religion has many methods, yet all these methods require man&rsquo;s strength in order for them to be carried out; thus, such methods were useless for the impotent man, who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years. The paralytic told the Lord Jesus about his miserable condition without any sense that the One before him was God. The Lord Jesus listened to him and said, &ldquo;Rise, take up your mat and walk&rdquo; (v. 8). When the paralytic received the Lord as the Word, he immediately took up his mat and walked. In the Lord, who is the Word, there is life. He did not come as God to be worshipped; He did not come as the Lord to be served. He came as the Word so that man may have life. This Word is life and resurrection. &ldquo;The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&rdquo; (v. 25). Those who hear the Word will live; those who touch the Word will rise up. This is a mysterious matter.</p>
<p>I am afraid that even though many among us have been saved for a while, our concept is still that the Lord Jesus is merely a great God, a glorious Lord whom we should worship and serve. We do not have the concept that the Lord is the Word as well as God and the Lord. When we touch Him, we touch not only God but also the Word, the God who has come forth. When we touch the Lord as the Word, we obtain life in the Word. These are two totally different matters.</p>
<p>I knew a brother who would speak to his wife and children on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, saying, &ldquo;We should put on our best clothes, and polish our shoes because our family is going to the worship service.&rdquo; Then he would give one child five dollars and another four dollars, saying, &ldquo;Keep this with you and give it when the church collects donations.&rdquo; The whole family would then go to worship God. After the service they would return home, and the wife would say in the afternoon, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s invite our aunts over and play mah-jongg,&rdquo; and the children would say, &ldquo;We saw an advertisement about a good movie in the newspaper today.&rdquo; It is possible to worship God without touching God as the Word. If they touched God as the Word, they would be made alive and would not be able to play mah-jongg or watch movies.</p>
<p>Is our gathering together for the purpose of having a worship service or for touching the Word of God? Man may worship God and serve the Lord outwardly, but only touching the Word gives life to man. If we touch the Word even once in a meeting, our whole being will be different because life is in the Word. With one touch of the Word, the paralytic could walk, the blind could see, the weak could be strong, the dead could resurrect, and the mah-jongg lovers could overturn their mah-jongg tables. There is life in the Word and great power in the life. This is to believe in the Lord Jesus. We need to see the difference between religion and the Lord Jesus, the difference between Christianity and the Word of God.</p>
<p>We absolutely acknowledge our Lord Jesus as the glorious God, the Lord of all. But please bear in mind that the Gospel of John shows His reaching us, not just as God or the Lord but as the Word. Furthermore, what He speaks into us as the Word of God is still just God Himself. God does not want us merely to worship Him, fear Him, or serve Him; God wants us to touch Him to obtain the life that is in Him. Once God is obtained by us, every problem is solved.</p>
