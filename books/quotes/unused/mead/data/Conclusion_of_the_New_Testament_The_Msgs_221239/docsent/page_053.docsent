   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Person and Work of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We also need to be recovered from the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truth concerning the person and work of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One such deviation from the truth concerning Christ's person is mentioned in 1 John 2:22 and 23.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 22 says, "Who is the liar if not he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the antichrist, who is denying the Father and the Son."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in the first century, certain heretics said that Jesus was not the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Denying that Jesus is the Christ was the heresy of Cerinthus, who distinguished the maker creator of the world from God and represented that maker as a subordinate power.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He taught adoptionist Christology, saying that Jesus became the Son of God by exaltation to a status that was not His by birth, thus denying the conception of Jesus by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In his heresy Cerinthus separated the earthly man Jesus, regarded as the son of Joseph and Mary, from the heavenly Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to John's word, Cerinthus was an antichrist because he denied that Jesus is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verse 22 John tells us that the antichrist denies the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To confess that Jesus is the Christ is to confess that He is the Son of God Matt 16:16; John 20:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, to deny that Jesus is the Christ is to deny the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 1 John 2:22 we see that the principle of antichrist is to deny what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus is the Christ, Christ is the Son of God, and the Son of God is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To deny any aspect of this truth is to deny something of what Christ is and thereby to follow the principle of antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 23 John goes on to say, "Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because the Son and the Father are one John 10:30; Isa 9:6 , to deny the Son is to be without the Father, and to confess the Son is to have the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 23 to deny the Son refers to the heresy that denies the deity of Christ, not confessing that the man Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First John 4:2 and 3 say, "In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God, and every spirit which does not confess Jesus, is not out of God; and this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now is already in the world."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see that the discernment of spirits is based upon whether or not a spirit confesses that Jesus has come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the spirit of a genuine prophet is motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth, this spirit will confess the divine conception of Jesus and confirm that He was born as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Jesus was conceived of the Spirit Matt 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God Luke 1:31-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word "flesh" in 1 John 4:2 is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As human beings, we were all born of flesh to be flesh John 3:6a .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus every human being is flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is God incarnate to become a man through holy conception.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He did not have a human father, for He was conceived of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although He was conceived of the Holy Spirit, this conception took place in the womb of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, He, the very God, became a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Contrary to the false teaching of the Docetists, who taught that Jesus Christ was not a real man but simply appeared so, Christ's body was not a phantasm.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the contrary, He had a real body, a physical body that was solid in its substance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was conceived of the Holy Spirit; He became flesh and was born of the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception.</S>
