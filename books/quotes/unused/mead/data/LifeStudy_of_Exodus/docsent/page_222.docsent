   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SIXTY-SEVEN THE POLLUTION CAUSED BY MAN S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE NAKEDNESS EXPOSED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH MAN S WAY Scripture Reading: Exo 20:24-26; Phil 3:2-3; 1 Cor 1:18-25</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message I am burdened to give a further word concerning the worship of God from 20:24-26.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Worship is a very crucial matter in man s relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout the thousands of years of human history, thoughtful people have considered the matter of the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When such people ponder the universe with the sun, moon, and stars, and the earth with all the plants, living creatures, and mankind, they realize that there must be a God, an almighty Being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then they begin to wonder how this God is to be worshipped.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Considerations such as these have given rise to different religions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The religions invented by man have their source in the considerations of thoughtful people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By studying nature man has discovered certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Furthermore, as a result of his observations and discoveries, he has made inferences.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Religion is the result of a thoughtful study of nature with man s philosophical inferences.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to the Bible, however, God does not allow man to devise his own way to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God does not give any ground to man s natural concept or thought.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He does not permit fallen man to worship Him according to inferences drawn from the study of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God condemns man s natural inferences as related to worship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, in the Bible God reveals how man is to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Genesis we do not have a clear revelation concerning the way to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Exodus contains a much fuller revelation of this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After God brought His chosen and redeemed people to His mountain, He came to have fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that the decree of the law on the mountain was given in an atmosphere of courtship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that at Mount Sinai God was courting His people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After giving them the Ten Commandments, the governing principles of the entire law of God, God went on to issue a number of ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Between the giving of the Ten Commandments and the decreeing of the ordinances, God spoke to the people concerning the way they should worship Him 20:22-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the short span of five verses, the main points related to the worship of God are covered.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we shall see, in 20:24-26 both man s work and man s way are utterly rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I was young, I regarded these verses in Exodus 20 as primitive and uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seemed to me that no skill or inventiveness was required to make an altar of earth or stone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even a child can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even the most primitive, uncultured, and uneducated people can build such an altar for the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I could not understand why God was willing to accept such a primitive altar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man s way is not to build this kind of altar.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the history of civilization, man likes to build towers and skyscrapers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who live in New York, Paris, and Tokyo may boast respectively of the Empire State Building, the Eiffel Tower, and the Tokyo Tower.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The thought of fallen man is to build up something high.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first occurrence of this was at Babel Gen 11 , where the people sought to build not only a city, but also a tower of which they could boast.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that tall buildings are constructed so that man is able to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more cultured people are, the more tall buildings they build.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But God s way is to have an altar without steps.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man s way is to build up something with as many steps as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As far as the worship of God is concerned, God gives no room for man s skill, ability, inventiveness, wisdom, labor, or power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the contrary, the altar God requires must be something which, in the eyes of man, is primitive and uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning the worship of God, the tendency of the natural man is to use his own power and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>People use their wisdom to make plans and use their power, including whatever skills and abilities they possess, to carry out their plans.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But according to 20:24-26, God does not recognize man s wisdom and power.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even though Moses had been educated in Egypt and was familiar with all the aspects of Egyptian culture, being trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians Acts 7:22 , God did not allow him to use his wisdom to build an altar for the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moses was not the only one among God s people familiar with Egyptian culture.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All those who came out of Egypt with him had been born there and knew the Egyptian way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All of them had received a strong infusion of Egyptian culture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 20:24-26 God gave them a clear word concerning worship, telling them to make an altar either of earth or of stones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They were not to use hewn stones, and they were not to build an altar so high that it required steps in order to reach it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God seemed to be saying to the people, I do not care for human work or invention, and I do not care for man s way or concept.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For the altar, you must use the materials created by Me. I care only for what I have created, not for man s work or man s way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In theology a distinction is often made between natural religion and revealed religion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many regard Christianity as a revealed religion, a religion which has its source in God s revelation, and regard all other religions as natural.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, it is very sad that even in Christianity today there is a great emphasis on man s work and man s way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In any Christian group it is easy to detect man s work and way, but it is difficult to find something which is purely according to God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Consider the situation in Catholicism and Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>How much there is of man s invention, skill, ability, plans, ways, power, and wisdom!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even the sermons given are filled with such things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Where can you hear a sermon that is pure and limited to the revelation of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Most sermons have many elements of culture, often mixed with the truth of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A few years ago some of us heard a message given by the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This message was a mixture of biblical truth and human thought.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Man s work, way, power, and wisdom have thoroughly saturated today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As a result, it has become a mixture of God s revelation and natural religion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we read carefully 20:24-26, we shall see that God s revelation leaves no room for man s work or way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God does not give even the slightest amount of space to man s power, ability, skill, strength, wisdom, or plans.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In like manner, in the Lord s recovery we do not give place to man s work or way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I have the assurance that if someone would conduct research on the recovery, he would find that we do not give ground to man s work or man s way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some may wonder if the practice of pray-reading the Word is a way invented by man.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, pray-reading is not an invention of man; on the contrary, it is according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In today s Christianity it is easy to see man s work and way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This can be observed even without studying things closely.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Among most Christians, man s work and man s way are very evident.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Some who have been strongly influenced by man s work and way consider the meetings of the churches in the Lord s recovery to be primitive and uncultured.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Their attitude toward us is that we are ignorant and have no knowledge or education.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When a certain person visited me a few years ago, he asked how many among us have doctoral degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He boasted that among those associated with him there were more than one hundred with Ph.D. degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is one illustration of the fact that in today s Christianity much attention is given to human power, ability, skill, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The consequence of this is that God is actually set aside.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>People may claim to worship God, but in their worship the work and way of man have actually caused them to put God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When the Roman Empire embraced Christianity, many elements of culture were brought into the so-called Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Constantine the Great opened the way for many pagan things to be brought in. This caused Christianity to become a melting pot of different elements of man s culture.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Furthermore, the Catholic Church introduced many such things into their worship.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>For this reason, in the worship practiced in Catholicism there are many human inventions.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Catholicism is filled with human ways, works, power, and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, it is abominable in the eyes of God to bring anything man-made into the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>At this point I would like to say a word especially to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We do not know how long it will be before the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The recovery may need to continue for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When some of you begin to take the lead in the churches, you may think that the Lord s recovery was brought to this country in a very primitive way.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then you may want to use tools to hew stones to beautify the recovery and to lift it up.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Automatically steps will be necessary to reach what has been built up in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In fact, in the past proposals were made to lift up the recovery in certain ways.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Some even tried to build a pyramid related to the service groups.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But by the Lord s mercy and grace, this pyramid was demolished.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Every step leading to the top of the pyramid was torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Instead, we simply gave everyone the opportunity to serve if they so desired.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Young people, do not bring man s work or man s way into the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To bring in anything of a human source is to insult the very God whom we worship.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If we study the history of religion and the present situation of Christianity, we shall see an abundance of man s work and way.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But I repeat, God does not allow these things to have any place in His worship.</S>
