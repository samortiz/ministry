In order to accomplish this intention, the Lord Jesus came to us as the Word of God so that we could receive Him and take Him as our life
The Lord Jesus brought God to us so that we might gain and receive the true grace in the universe, which is God Himself
The book of John tells us that the simplest way for us to gain and experience God is to take Christ as our life
The Lord made this matter simple by telling us that He is the bread of life for us to eat and the living water for us to drink
If we want to gain and experience God, we must take Christ as our life by eating Christ as our food and drinking Christ as our drink
We may know the doctrine that Christ is the bread of life, but do we know how to actually take Christ as the bread of life into us?
Do we know the real and practical way to apply Christ as life to our daily living and take Him as our food and drink?
Although the way to experience, apply, and appropriate Christ in daily life is very simple, most of the Lord's children do not know the way
The Lord being the bread of life and the water of life to us are very practical matters and not mere doctrines
We must realize that all these material things are shadows pointing to the real thing, which is Christ Himself
When we are putting on our clothes in the morning, we should realize that our clothes are not the real clothes
Rather, we must experience Christ as our daily necessities and our life supply day by day and even moment by moment
When we are going to visit a friend, we must remember not to do it by our natural life but by Christ as our life
We must realize that the real life by which we live before God is not the natural life but Christ Himself as life to us
We must realize that our physical life and all the positive material things around us are only shadows; they are not the reality
In John 5:39-40 the Lord told the Pharisees, 'You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life
As long as we enjoy Christ as our rest, we may have a Sabbath not only on the Lord's Day but also every day and every hour
We should have a feast not merely once every three months or on holidays; we should have a feast moment by moment by enjoying Christ
If we want to have a new start, have rest, or experience enjoyment as in a feast, we must apply and appropriate Christ
If we do not eat and drink enough, we may eventually be infected with germs and may cause ourselves much trouble
Do we truly realize that Christ is our dwelling place, our way, our clothing, our rest, our joy, and our wisdom?
There is such an urgent need that the Lord's children know Christ in a practical and experiential way, not a doctrinal way
We need to ask ourselves how much we experience Christ in our daily living and apply Him in our daily situations
When some people heard that Christ was the bread of life and that He could be their food, they said, 'This word is hard; who can hear it'?
They could not understand how this man could give Himself as bread to them and be eaten by them, so they left Him
Whenever we contact the written Word not merely with our mind but with our spirit the word spoken to us by the Lord becomes the Spirit to us
When we have the word, we have the Spirit; when we have the Spirit, we enjoy life; and when we enjoy life, we experience the light
When we contact the Word with our spirit, we receive the word into us, and the word becomes the living Spirit within us
As we enjoy the life supply, the life becomes light to us-a realm, sphere, and kingdom of light in which we may walk, work, and live
Christ as the embodiment of God is life to us, and when we enjoy and experience Him as our life, we become His increase, which must be one
We have pointed out that the three main points in the Gospel of John are life, the increase, and the oneness of the increase
The bridegroom is Christ, and the bride, the increase of Christ, is the church, which comprises all those who believe in Christ
Without Eve, Adam would have been single like a bachelor, but with Eve, Adam had a wife and a counterpart to match him
The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord came to impart life to us in order that He could have an increase for Himself
In 12:24-25 the Lord told us that He was the one grain of wheat that would fall into the earth to die in order to become the many grains
If we realize what the life and nature of the church are, we will realize the purpose and function of the church
Because we have two lives and two persons, we may say that we have two last names; our last name was originally Adam, but now it is Christ
Whenever we are going to talk with someone, we must realize and remember that we are two persons with two lives
We are constantly in a situation in which we must choose to live by one life or the other and in one person or the other
We must reckon that our old man has been crucified and put to an end and that now it is Christ who lives in us
We must practice one thing at all times and in all things-to reject our natural life and take Christ as our life
When we practice to give up ourselves and to take Christ as our life, we will realize that we are parts of the increase of Christ
The Lord told us not only that we as the many grains are the increase of Christ but also that He is the vine and we are the branches
If we deny the natural life take Christ as our life day by day and live as branches of the vine we will sense our need for other Christians
It is possible for us to be one with others because we are in Christ, we have the divine life, and Christ is in us
We must realize that we have been put into Christ and are in Christ as our sphere in which we walk, live, and work
We must remember that day by day we are walking, living, and working in Christ, who is our realm and our everything
The Lord is our pattern; while He was on the earth He always realized that He was in the Father, and He never acted outside of the Father
Not only are we in Christ, but we also have the same divine life, the one life, which is Christ Himself and also God Himself
Just as a cup must be filled with water to be perfect, we as vessels of Christ must be filled with Christ in order to be perfected
On the one hand, we will be in Christ as our spiritual realm, and on the other hand, Christ will be in us as our spiritual fullness
As a result, he may offer himself to the Lord, take Christ as his life, and truly begin to practice living by Christ
Our oneness is based on the facts that we are in Christ, that we have the divine life, and that Christ is in us
In our daily living and in all the situations that we encounter, we must take Christ as our life and remember that we are in Christ
We will have Christ as our life, Christ will have the increase among us, and this increase will be realized in the oneness
Through this oneness, the world will know that Christ is the sent One, and Christ will be glorified, magnified, and received by many others
Christ will be glorified and magnified before the world, and as a result, many people will see Him and believe into Him as their Savior
Christ, who is the expression and embodiment of God, came to present God to us so that we could take Him and gain Him
We must realize that God's intention is to be life to us and that our relationship with God is a matter of life
The concept of doing good and of working for God is from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, not from the tree of life
As the branches abide in the vine, the life of the vine in the sap becomes their sufficient supply, and they spontaneously bear fruit
God has no intention of asking you to do anything for Him, so you should forget about doing good things for God
They do not realize that Christ is their patience and that as long as they allow Christ to live in them, they will have patience
When we allow Christ to live in us, Christ as patience will prevail, but without Christ living in us, we cannot have patience
We need to see that we are no longer parts of Adam; rather, we are parts of Christ, branches of the divine vine
After doing so many things on the earth, the Lord prayed to the Father that all the believers would be one in Him
The many grains in chapter 12 and the branches in chapter 15 are equal to the bride as the increase of Christ in chapter 3
The increase of Christ, though it consists of all the believers as the many grains and the many branches, is one, not many
Christ has only one increase, but this one increase consists of all the believers, signified by the many grains and the many branches
We as the many grains must become a loaf , and the only way we can become a loaf is by being ground and crushed
To produce a loaf of bread, you must grind and crush the grain into flour, mix the flour with water, and bake it
If we determine to keep our perfection, we will always be independent, and we will never be built up with others as part of the loaf
Today many Christians are praying that they would know the will of God so that they would know what to do in certain situations
The will of God cannot be accomplished unless there is this oneness among the saints as the dwelling place of God
God's intention is not that we would do anything, because we could never do anything that would be pleasing to God
On the one hand, we need to stop ourselves from trying to do good and always keep ourselves in contact with Christ
Mingling is a matter of God becoming life to us ; when we take God as our life and God becomes life to us, He mingles Himself with us
We may also say that God's intention is to mingle Himself with us so that we may become one with Him and with one another
The word mingled can be found in Leviticus 2, where it is used by the Holy Spirit to describe God's desire in His relationship with man
The oil and the fine flour signify divinity and humanity as two different natures being mingled together as one
Whatever we eat becomes mingled with us; thus, the best way for something to become mingled with us is for us to eat it
Although this is very clear and simple, most of the time we do not apply this to our relationship with the Lord Jesus
We must all consider and ask ourselves whether we have had the real experience of taking the Lord as our food day by day and living by Him
Because he was just as human as we are, he went to the Lord and prayed three times that the Lord would take the thorn away
The Lord said to him I will not take the thorn away from you because My grace is sufficient for you and My strength is perfected in weakness
The Lord leaves them with us and causes us to learn to take Him as our food and our life supply to become inwardly energized
When our inner man, our spirit, is energized, we become strong enough to bear the burden and suffer all our troubles while praising Him
God's eternal purpose is that we would daily take Him as our life, life supply, and food so that He can be mingled with us
In other words, it should not only be we who are loving them, but it should also be God mingled with us who is loving them
Andrew Murray once said that real prayer is prayer made by the Christ dwelling in us to the Christ in the heavens
In other words, when we are praying, it should not only be we who are praying but also Christ within us praying
When we come to the Lord's table meeting, we often have the natural concept that we are there to remember the Lord in our mind
In instituting the Lord's table, the Lord Himself said, 'This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me
In all the matters and situations that happen to us day by day, we must practice one thing-to live not by ourselves but by the Lord
The more we take the Lord as our food and life supply and live by Him, the more we will realize the oneness of the Body
The life by which we live in the Lord is not an individualistic life but a life for the corporate Body and the members of the Body
When we live by Christ, there will be a longing in us to always be related with others and a real desire to be one with all the saints
We will sense that we are simply members of the Body and will treasure the relatedness between us and the other saints
These are the two most important matters in the Scriptures-being mingled with God and being one with all the saints
As Christians and children of the Lord and as the Body of Christ, the church of God, there must be the mingling and the oneness among us
The mingling is a matter of our relationship with God, and the oneness is a matter of our relatedness with one another
If we practice taking Him as our life supply and living by Him, we will be delivered from the natural life and individualism
The matter of life involves the mingling of divinity with humanity, and the result of this mingling is the Body, the oneness
The first picture, which is in Genesis 2, is a picture of life, and the central item in this picture is the tree of life
What the Lord has been doing and is still doing throughout the generations is building up a city, a Body, by His divine life
The ministry of the apostle Paul, who represents all the gifted ones, is very much concerned with these two matters of life and building
On the one hand, he tells us that Christ is life to us and that we have to take Christ as our life and live by Christ
Christ as our life must be everything to us in our Christian life; whatever we do must be Christ lived out by us
We should forget about all other things and spend some time before the Lord to consider ourselves with respect to these two matters
The extent to which the Lord values us depends on how much of the divine mingling we have and how much we are in the oneness of the Body
These two matters are not merely a wonderful teaching or something that will take place in the heavens or in eternity
The Bible also tells us that we have been reborn in our spirit and that our spirit has been renewed through regeneration
The way to take the Lord as our life is not by thinking or using our mind but by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord as the Spirit
While we worship and seek Him, He strengthens us in our spirit to worship Him and energizes us to praise and thank Him
He mentioned this after his disciples came to him and told him that all the people were following the Lord Jesus
Revelation also tells us that on the twelve gates of the New Jerusalem are the twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel
The twelve foundations of the New Jerusalem bear the names of the twelve apostles, representing all the saved ones in the New Testament age
The New Jerusalem is a composition of living persons to be the living bride of Christ and the living habitation of God
Later, Revelation tells us that the appearance of the whole city is like jasper and that the wall of the city is built with jasper stone
In Revelation we see the fulfillment of this prayer in all the saints who are built together as lampstands in each locality
God is the light, the Lamb is the lamp, and the holy city is the lampstand built of gold , like the golden lampstands in Revelation 1
The Lord is seeking after these two matters-the mingling of life and the oneness of the Body, which are Christ and the church
The basic thought of God in the Scriptures is that we would take God as our life in the same way that we take food
At that time God did not tell Adam to do many different things; instead, He advised Adam to take care of his eating
If we go to the Lord, contact Him, feed on Him, and drink Him, wonderful things will happen as an issue of our eating and drinking Him
Ezekiel 36:26-27 says that the Lord gave us a new heart and a new spirit and that He put His own Spirit into us
Without a heart to desire the food and a mouth and stomach to receive the food, we could never take in the food
If we know how to exercise our spirit, we will be able to contact the Lord and be in the current of the transmitting Spirit
It is not by thinking in our mind that we contact the Lord rather it is by loving the Lord with our heart and receiving Him with our spirit
If there is any condemnation or offense in our conscience, this will spoil our heart, and our heart will not be at peace
If you have a brilliant mind and exercise it too much your mind may be corrupted from the simplicity toward the Lord by too much considering
It is one thing to be at a table in the presence of food, and it is another thing to actually take in the food
Today many Christians talk about the presence of God in the Old Testament sense, but the New Testament shows us something deeper
Not only is the presence of the Lord with us, but the Lord Himself lives within us and is even mingled with us
You can take, eat, and digest Him, and He can be mingled with you, become a part of you, and become the very element of your being'
Even when we are ministering the word, we must forget about what we are doing and simply keep ourselves in contact with the Lord
We must forget about our doing and working and instead learn how to enjoy the Lord, eat the Lord, and drink the Lord
The Lord has given us a new heart and a new spirit and has put His Spirit into our spirit that we may enjoy Him all the time
In the Gospel of John the Lord Himself said, 'I am the bread of life,' and 'He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me'
Today, since we have Christ as the reality of the types, we must make eating and drinking the Lord our reality
Corinthians 12:13 tells us that we have not only been baptized in the Spirit but have also been made to drink of this Spirit
Similarly, we may know many teachings about Christ, but if we do not eat and drink Christ, Christ will remain objective to us
Being a Christian is less a matter of knowing and more a matter of eating and drinking Christ day by day and moment by moment
These are the two biggest gifts we have as Christians-the Spirit within our spirit and the Word of God in our hands
There are all kinds of food and riches stored in the Bible, and our urgent need is to take and receive them little by little
As the psalmist said, we will be saturated with the fatness of the Lord's house and drink of the river of His pleasures
The Word promises that if we seek first the kingdom and His righteousness, all our daily needs will be added to us
We will speak with the Lord not only when we are by ourselves in a private room but also while we are talking with others
We can speak to the Lord while we are walking on the street or while we are working or are busy with various matters
We will spontaneously know what to do, regardless of our situation, because the Lord will be living in us in a practical way
The more we contact the Lord and live by, through, and in Him, the more we will realize the oneness of the Body
You may have to read several verses or even half a chapter in order to understand something and be able to pray
The main thing is that instead of merely receiving the Word as knowledge with our mind, we must exercise our spirit to pray over the Word
Question: Is this kind of prayer something that you do only as an individual, or can it be done in a group as well?
It would be very good for the brothers and sisters to come together in a meeting to read the Word and then to pray over the Word
We surely need the proper teachings, but if we keep these teachings in our mind instead of using them for our prayer, they can damage us
The soul is composed of the mind the emotion and the will and the spirit is composed of the conscience the intuition and the fellowship
Regrettably, some Christians say that the soul and the spirit are the same thing and that the terms soul and spirit are synonymous
John 3:20-21 says, 'Because if our heart blames us, it is because God is greater than our heart and knows all things
Thoughts belong to the mind, and intentions belong to the will, indicating that the mind and the will are also parts of the heart
We may say that the heart is composed of four parts-the conscience of the spirit and the emotion, mind, and will of the soul
Otherwise, it will be difficult for us to be healthy Christians and to make progress with the Lord in the inner life
In order to love the Lord, we must love Him with our heart, but in order to take the Lord, we cannot use our heart
We must realize that the Lord is the Spirit and that the only way we can contact Him and take Him in is by using our spirit
Many Christians like to talk about the things of the Lord and to study the Scriptures, but when you ask them to pray, they become silent
Our spirit should be so strong, living, and active that we cannot waste time talking but must pray by using our spirit
We must realize that even though we may love Him with our heart and understand Him with our mind, He may still be somewhat objective to us
If we want Him to be subjective to us, we must take Him in, receive Him, eat Him, and drink Him with our spirit
You could not speak very much to them, because they would not understand, but if you asked them to pray, they would seize the opportunity
We must exercise our heart to love the Lord and exercise our spirit to contact, take, receive, eat, and drink the Lord
If we are going to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, our heart must first be adjusted; that is, we must have a proper heart
If we have lost the simplicity of our mind toward the Lord, this is an indication that the enemy has corrupted our mind
We must have a will that is soft, submissive, and meek toward the Lord; then our heart and spirit will be proper
Our conscience must be pure, our mind must be simple, our will must be soft, and our emotions must be full of love
Our spirit will be strengthened and satisfied, and our heart will be filled with the Lord and will become a home for the Lord
Since this man, Adam, was created according to Christ, we may say that Adam was a figure or photograph of Christ
Just as a photograph of you is according to you and is a figure of you, so Adam was made according to Christ and was a figure of Christ
At the time he was created, Adam was made in the image of Christ, but he did not have Christ Himself as his life
If the glove could think and feel, it might wonder what it was made for or what the meaning of its existence is
When we receive Christ as our life, He enters into us and fills us; consequently, our human life is filled with meaning
Christians talk much about sanctification , but they neglect the more important matter of transformation, which is a matter of life
Psalm 51:6 speaks of the inward parts, which are the parts of the soul, and of the hidden part, which is the spirit
Christ is now in our spirit, but He may not have much ground, room, or place in the other parts of our being, especially our mind
Our mind is the most important part of our inward being, because our daily life and our entire being are under the control of our mind
Sometimes it may seem that we are under the direction of our emotions, but it is actually our mind that directs our lives and our being
We can deny the soul-life and reject the natural mind by standing on the ground that we have been crucified on the cross
If we want to please the Lord and take Him as our life, we must learn the lesson of denying our mind in our daily life
When we were regenerated, we received not only a new spirit with which to contact the Lord but also a new heart with which we can love God
Because of this, every Christian, whether he is newly saved or has been a believer for many years, has a longing to love the Lord
The enemy will often accuse us by injecting thoughts into our mind, saying, 'How can a person like you love the Lord?
We need to learn to deny the self and to turn from our mind to our spirit, from the outer man to the inner man
The way to put off the old man is by denying the self, and the way to put on the new man is by exercising the spirit
The way to realize the mingling of God with man and the oneness of the Body is first by regeneration and then by transformation
When we are mingled with God, the oneness of the Body of Christ is automatically and spontaneously manifested among us
They are like the two ends of a cord; what we see on one end is love, and what we see on the other end is grace
John 117 says that grace came through Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ as grace is the expression of God and the expression of Gods love
We can touch, experience, and realize this grace in the Holy Spirit and through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
What we lack is the experience of Christ, and the only way we can obtain, experience, and realize Christ is by experiencing the Spirit
As Christians we already have the Spirit in our spirit ; if we did not have the Spirit, we would have neither Christ nor God
We may think that it was sufficient for Him to be born of the Spirit and filled with the Spirit and to walk and live a life in the Spirit
At the time of His baptism Jesus already had the Holy Spirit inwardly, yet the Holy Spirit still had to come upon Him outwardly
We may have had some experience of the working of the Spirit within us, but have we had any experience of the working of the Spirit upon us?
On one hand, the Spirit is the living water that we can drink ; on the other hand, the Spirit is like clothing that we can put on
Luke 24:49 likens the 'power from on high,' which is the Holy Spirit, to a piece of clothing with which we should be clothed
Corinthians 12:13 tells us that 'in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body' and that we were also 'given to drink one Spirit'
To be baptized in the Spirit is to be put into the Spirit, just as to be baptized in water is to be put into water
The Lord Jesus was the first one to be born of the Holy Spirit, filled with the Holy Spirit, and baptized in the Holy Spirit
On the day of resurrection Peter and the other disciples received the Spirit inwardly and were reborn with the eternal life
Before the Lord was crucified, the disciples, because of their pride, argued with one another about who was greater
After the Lord's resurrection and before the day of Pentecost, one hundred and twenty of them prayed together for ten days with one accord
We can see that the disciples were born of the Holy Spirit, filled with the Holy Spirit, and then baptized in the Holy Spirit
Without experiencing the Spirit, we cannot experience Christ in a full and real way, because Christ is the Spirit
We have seen that the mingling of God with man is a matter of the Spirit because the Triune God has been consummated as the Spirit
We need to be supplied that we may grow and mature in life, and we also need to be equipped so that we may serve the Lord
The growth in life and the use of our talent in our service depend very much on the two aspects of the Holy Spirit's work
The Gospel of John deals with the matter of life, while the books written by Luke deal with the power needed in our service
The Gospel of Luke shows us that the Lord Jesus as the Savior preached and ministered to the people of the world by the power of the Spirit
At the end of the Gospel of Luke the disciples were told to wait until they were clothed with power from on high
Many times the brothers and sisters wonder why it is so difficult to have good meetings or to pray to the Lord in the meetings
If we all experience the baptism of the Spirit, we will be released, and we will be equipped and empowered to carry out our service
If we experience the baptism in the Spirit, we will be able to pray freely, to release our spirit, and to release others' spirits
We all have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, and through our regeneration the Holy Spirit came into us and is now dwelling in us
The Word clearly indicates that after our regeneration we must be filled with the Spirit in every part of our being
Acts 6:3 and 5 say, 'Look for seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint over this need
For the foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them; but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps
The prudent answered, saying, Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves'
In addition to the lamp there is a vessel that holds extra oil so that when the light begins to go out, extra oil is prepared
We may be full of our own thoughts, the thoughts of the natural mind, so we must empty ourselves by denying the natural mind
As a result, our mind will be full of the Spirit, our mind will be the mind of the Spirit, and our spirit will be the spirit of our mind
The same thing must happen with our emotion and will so that every part of our being can be occupied and filled by the Spirit
When the Holy Spirit occupies us, Christ occupies us, and when we are full of the Holy Spirit, we are full of Christ
There is only one way to be filled with the Holy Spirit: we must go to the Lord and contact Him by exercising our spirit
As we love the Lord and exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, we will realize that we must reject and deny our natural man, our soul-life
Consequently, we will be filled and saturated with Christ as the Spirit, and He will possess and occupy every part of our being
As Christians we must be filled and saturated with the Spirit, and we must also experience being baptized in the Holy Spirit
In this message we would like to see something concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit, or being clothed with the Holy Spirit
If we were clothed but had nothing inside, our outward condition would be proper, but our inward condition would be abnormal
To be a normal Christian, we must be filled with Christ as life inwardly and clothed with Christ as power outwardly
In the Greek language these two words are clearly distinct from each other, but in English they are both translated fill
Verse 2 says Suddenly there was a sound out of heaven as of a rushing violent wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
Just as the water of baptism is outside of us and not inside of us, the Holy Spirit of baptism is outside of us and not inside of us
Inwardly, we must be filled with the Holy Spirit, but outwardly, we must be clothed with and immersed in the Holy Spirit
The first case occurred on the day of Pentecost when the one hundred and twenty disciples were baptized in the Holy Spirit
There were a number of people in Samaria who had believed in the Lord Jesus had been baptized into His name and had received the Holy Spirit
The fifth case involved the believers in Ephesus, who were genuine believers but had only been baptized into John's baptism
The eternal fact is that the Lord as the Head of the Body did not baptize individual believers in the Holy Spirit
When that representative laid his hands on them the Head of the Body honored that by immersing them in the Holy Spirit who was upon the Body
If we remain individualistic and independent of the Body, it will be nearly impossible to experience the baptism in the Spirit
If we stand as those who have been joined to the Body of Christ, we will experience being clothed with the Spirit
On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius the Spirit who had come down upon the Head also came down upon the Body
After the Lord Jesus ascended, He was exalted to the highest position in the universe and seated at the right hand of God
After we experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we will realize that as members of the Body, it is our portion to serve the Lord
