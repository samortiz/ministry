	 <h2 class="head1">LEAVING THE ORDINANCES OF RELIGION<br />
TO CARE ONLY FOR CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Galatians 1 tells us that religion with its traditions persecutes the church, ravages it, and tries to uproot it (vv. 13-14). Following this, chapter 2 speaks clearly concerning the law with its ordinances. Paul begins this chapter by saying, &ldquo;Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also. And I went up according to revelation&rdquo; (vv. 1-2a). Paul went to Jerusalem not in a political way but according to and in obedience to a revelation from the Lord. Moreover, he took with him not only Barnabas, a Jew, but also Titus, an uncircumcised Gentile (v. 3). The Jewish believers in Jerusalem still esteemed the outward ordinance of circumcision. If Paul had gone to Jerusalem in the way of Judaistic teaching, he would not have gone with an uncircumcised Gentile for fear of offending the Jews. However, he went up in the way of revelation, taking Titus with him. For a Jew, it was not a small matter to give up the ordinances of the law. However, that no one compelled Titus to be circumcised means that Paul and those with him had given up the ordinances. Moreover, after Paul arrived, he did not seat Titus at a separate table when they ate (cf. vv. 11-13). This also proves that Paul acted not according to the politics and politeness of man but to a revelation from the Lord.</p>
<p>Christianity today is divided because of its many different ordinances. Some feel that it is normal to use musical instruments in the meetings, but others are offended by this, and as a result some Christian meetings have been divided. This demonstrates the problem with ordinances. In order for us to have the practical church life, all our ordinances need to go. Even some among us may still be holding on to their particular ordinances. Once a new one, who was a hippie, came into a meeting clothed with a large blanket. Because of the religious nature in certain ones and their ordinances concerning dress, they were bothered by this new one. In actuality, we cannot reject anyone simply because he dresses in a certain way. On another occasion, a number of saints who were burdened to leave their oldness behind had the feeling to be baptized a second time. Again, certain ones were bothered by this and began to criticize. We are not arguing for being baptized a second time. We are simply pointing out that these saints were touched by the Lord, and they were revived and living; moreover, many people came to the Lord through them. To oppose the Lord&rsquo;s spontaneous moving is to keep the old religious ordinances, which bring in spiritual death and dormancy.</p>
<p>Our living should be according to the holy Word, but we should not make any point in the Word an ordinance to keep. Although we may practice a certain matter, to make it an ordinance that causes others to be excluded is wrong and annuls the church life. If the Lord delays His return, those who are young people today will one day bear the responsibility of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Therefore, they must all be clear that there should not be any ordinances in the church life. Some may feel to wash others&rsquo; feet, but foot-washing must never become an ordinance. Likewise, the sisters may cover their head when they pray, but they must never make head covering an ordinance. It is the same with methods of baptism or whether or not to eat certain things. We all, including the young brothers and sisters among us, must be clear that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not hold on to ordinances. Rather, we care only for Christ and the church.</p>
<p>Peter had seen the vision on the Mount of Transfiguration, and he was a witness of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension (Matt. 17:1-2; Mark 16:7; Acts 1:3, 9). Moreover, he had received the outpoured Spirit on the day of Pentecost and had seen the vision from the heavens concerning fellowship with the Gentiles (2:4, 14; 10:9-16). The visions that Peter saw were great, wonderful, and marvelous. In Galatians 2 Peter realized that he was free to eat with the uncircumcised Gentiles, and he practiced to do so. However, when some came from James, Peter began to shrink back and separate himself from the Gentiles. Moreover, the rest of the Jews, even Barnabas, joined him in this hypocrisy (vv. 12-13). At this point Paul opposed Peter to his face, rebuking him for not walking in a straightforward way in relation to the truth of the gospel (vv. 11, 14). It is almost incredible that Peter would practice hypocrisy in this way. This demonstrates how strong the influence of religion is.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING NOT BY THE LAW BUT<br />
BY THE INDWELLING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</h2>
<p>The Old Testament law was certainly good, but God&rsquo;s economy is not a matter of good or bad. God&rsquo;s economy is to dispense Christ into us so that we may be His corporate vessel, the Body of Christ, as His expression. To try to keep the law distracts people from God&rsquo;s economy. The law was simply a child conductor unto Christ to keep those whom God had predestinated for Christ and the church (3:24). We may compare the law to a mule cart. A mule cart is not bad, but today is the day of the jumbo jet. Because we have the &ldquo;jumbo jet&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, we should no longer insist on keeping the &ldquo;mule cart&rdquo; of the law. The law was good, but today we have nothing to do with the old, outward law. Rather, we have been predestinated to receive Christ and become the members of His Body. Christ is the center of God&rsquo;s economy, and He is our destiny, our person, our life, and our everything. Do not argue whether the mule cart is right or wrong. We do not care for that. We are on the jumbo jet of God&rsquo;s economy.</p>
<p>Although we are no longer under the law given by Moses, we may still be under a self-made law. We may have made for ourselves many more than ten commandments concerning our personal life, our marriage life, and our work for the Lord, none of which we are able to keep. We need to leave all these behind so that we may care only for Christ. Galatians 2:19 says, &ldquo;I through law have died to law that I might live to God.&rdquo; We are dead to the law, and now in resurrection we are living to God. We have nothing to do with the law; we have everything to do with God. Then in verse 20 Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; This verse indicates that not only is Christ our life, but He also lives in us in a practical way.</p>
<p>The sisters should have no law as to where and when they should shop. Instead, they have Christ, who lives in them. To ask whether it is right or wrong to go shopping is to practice the law. Instead, we should check whether it is the Christ who lives in us or only we ourselves who want to go shopping. Many times the Lord&rsquo;s word to us is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; If the Lord says no to our shopping, we also must say no. Then when is the right time to go shopping? It is when Jesus goes. Today we are living by Christ. If Christ wants to go to a certain place, we should go along with Him, but if He does not want to go, we can declare, &ldquo;Hallelujah, it is no longer I, but it is Christ who lives in me.&rdquo; He is our life, and He is also our person as the One who lives in us. We are no longer in the realm of ordinances, law, regulations, or right and wrong. We are in another realm, the realm of Christ, who is the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The proper church life issues from our experience of Christ living in us. From now, we should not ask whether it is right or wrong to wear a certain item or to do a certain thing. To ask in this way lacks the testimony of a person who lives Christ in the church life. Our living in the church is not a matter of law, ordinances, regulations, forms, or rituals. It is a matter only of Christ. Moreover, it is not a matter of what we do or do not do. It is altogether a matter of who does it&mdash;we or Christ. As long as Christ is doing something, we go along with Him. To live in this way is according to the revelation in Galatians. We have died to the law, and we are living to God. We are crucified with Christ, and it is no longer we who live, but it is Christ as our person who lives in us.</p>
