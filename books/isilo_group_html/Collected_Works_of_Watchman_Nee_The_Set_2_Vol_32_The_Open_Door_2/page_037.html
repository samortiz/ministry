But thank the Lord that the brothers and sisters were not affected during our conference. Brothers Zhang Gun-jih and Yu Yien-chou from Yi-Yang, and Brother Feng Shian-lu from Chang-Deh have also come. The subject of the conference was "The Glory of Christ." Brother Tang Shou-ling was responsible for giving the messages. We had one tragedy in Ch'ang-sha: Eight hundred people who were escaping to the countryside hired a steamer, and the steamer sank because of being overweight; only six people survived. Indeed, those who do not have God are afraid of death when they do not escape, and face death even sooner when they try to escape. This world is filled with tragedies! We can only ask the Lord to come quickly and to terminate these things.</p><p>Lan Tsi-yi, Ch'ang-sha, July 26</p><h2 class="head2">Chungking, Szechuan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>There were four days of gospel meetings from July 27 to 30 at 4-3 Chang's Garden. Although it was hot, many people came. Two rooms were filled, and we added more chairs outside the door. There were over a hundred people within that little place. Thank the Lord, there were twenty to thirty people who raised their hands to receive the Lord, and many put down their names. On August 1 and 3 there will be a new beginners' Bible study. The brothers and sisters are all in one accord this time toward the work of preaching the gospel. We do thank the Lord for this.</p><p>Yuen Chou Jieh-min, August 1</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>This time the Lord has done some special work at the Midwife School. Five girls were baptized. On the seventh of this month, we conducted a baptism using the swimming pool of the YMCA. There were seven brothers and sixteen sisters. We truly thank the Lord! Brother Lee Shi-chun from Hankow has left for Ch'eng-tu already. Mrs. Wang has found a job through the recommendation of Brother Hu Suen-ming. Sisters Ma and Tong are now working and studying at the Ren-Je Hospital through my recommendation. Others are preparing themselves to apply for the schools. Sister Yuen Jing-hwa has gone to Nan-An to work as a private tutor.</p><p>Yuen Chou Jieh-min, August 11</p><h2 class="head2">Luzon, Philippines</h2><p>Enclosed please find X Hong Kong dollars for the following uses: (1) X dollars for the publication of The Christian, (2) X dollars for the publication of The Open Door, and (3) X dollars to each of the workers. (Since there are no workers in Hankow, please direct the money to workers nearby who are in need. Please distribute it according to your discretion, and please retain one portion for yourself.)
