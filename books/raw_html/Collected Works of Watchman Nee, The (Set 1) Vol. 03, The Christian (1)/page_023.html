<P>All of these lights were created by God "to rule" (Gen. 1:16-17). There is ruling power in the shining of the saints. Many sins must hide themselves before the saints. Many filthy people with corrupt deeds dare not approach the saints. All the saints who walk in God's holiness, glory, righteousness, and love share such ruling power.</P><P>What the saints rule over is the night. The greatest authority for an ascended Christian is to have victory over the power of darkness. Before ascension believers are not clear about spiritual warfare. They do not have a clear view of the devices of Satan, the attack of the enemy, the temptation of the devil, or the counterfeit of the evil spirits. Not until they reach ascension do they sense the reality of the power of darkness. Then they realize how to overcome the enemy by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul-life. Then they know how to use the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, to attack the power of Satan. Then they know how to pray in a challenging way asking God to destroy all the activities of Satan. Then they know how to stand on the ground of the cross, holding the accomplished victory of the cross, using words of praise to chase away the attacks which come from evil spirits. Then they know how to exercise their will to fight against every stratagem of the enemy. Since the ascended believers have already obtained a position that allows them to rule over the power of darkness, they will have frequent experiences of crushing Satan under their feet.</P><P>These lights are also for "signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years,...and to divide the light from the darkness" (vv. 14, 18). Ascended believers know the signs of the age. They know how to discern the times. They have God's view from the throne and are very clear about world events. Ascended believers will know about the situation in the last days. Therefore, they will be at rest and unmoved when things change and confused, panicked people wonder what is happening and what to do. They will know what will surely happen. When they reach the ascended position, believers will know about the Lord's move in the last days, about their proper manner toward the church, about their attitude toward the world in the last days, and about how watchful they should be. They will know that in the last days false Christs and false prophets will deceive the world. They will know how evil spirits and fallen angels will confuse the world and entice men to follow the teachings of demons, deceiving ignorant saints to believe in miracles and wonders, and to seek after false tongues and all kinds of supernatural experiences. Those who are not rooted in the Word of God will be deceived. But ascended believers, who have God's view, will not be deceived, for they will already know of their devices.</P><P>VIII."And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven" (v. 20). This is the work of the fifth day. This day is the period between ascension and the Lord's coming back to be King. Therefore, it is not difficult to derive the spiritual significance.</P><P>God created the fish and the birds (v. 21). Water itself cannot produce fish; neither can the earth produce birds. Fish and birds were created by God and were placed in the water and on the earth. Both items have life (v. 21). They are only different in the form of life. Water represents our sinful nature, the flesh, as mentioned earlier. This brings us into trials. Yet in these trials the grace of God works out the form of life for us. The earth represents our purified soul-life, as mentioned earlier. This causes us to be greatly affected. In this, the goodness of God works out a form of life for us.</P><P>Although our life has reached the point of ascension, we are still human and living on this earth. We have no way to express the life of God except through our body. Ascension is to go out of the world; but today is the time for us to live in the world. Through His teaching, God enables us to express His life through our soul and our body. When we have reached this step, our life seems to be taking form. Although the forms of life differ, this is the time of going "from glory to glory." Ascension is our heavenly position. But today is the time for our living to be expressed on this earth. Therefore, in dealing with the world, we have no choice but to express our life through our body and soul. The outward forms of the fish and the birds are different, but the inner principle of life is the same. The fish in the water indicate that there is life in the water. The birds on the earth indicate that there is life on the earth. Originally, the water and earth were dead and without life; yet God was able to create living creatures, though in different forms, and put them there. This is very clear. When our Christian life first begins, we do not have life in our body or our soul. But after we ascend to the heavenlies, the life of God will be expressed in our body and soul through our living on the earth. We should be clear, however, that there will never be life in our body and our soul; it is only the life of God which is expressed in them. "Among whom you shine as luminaries in the world, holding forth the word of life" (Phil. 2:15-16). "Your life is hidden with Christ in God." This is ascension. "Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth" (Col. 3:3, 5). This is to express life. In this way, we will get the blessing from God (Gen. 1:22).</P>
