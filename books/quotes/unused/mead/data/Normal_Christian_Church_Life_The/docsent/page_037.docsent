   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All believers living in the same locality belong to the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is an unchanging principle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We dare not alter "all the believers in a locality" to "all the undenominational believers in a locality."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we make undenominationalism or unsectarianism the boundary of our church, instead of locality, then we lose our local standing as a church and become a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is not a denominational church, nor an interdenominational church, nor even an undenominational church we are after, but a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The difference between a local church and an undenominational church is as vast as the difference between heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A local church is undenominational, but an undenominational church is denominational.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"The church in Corinth" is scriptural, but "the church of all those who say, I am of Christ' in Corinth" is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our work is positive and constructive, not negative and destructive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are out to establish churches, not to destroy denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Human nature is prone to go to extremes; it is so easy for us either to be undenominational ourselves and demand undenominationalism of others, or else to tolerate denominationalism in others and gradually become denominational ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We ourselves must be undenominational, but we must not demand undenominationalism of other Christians as the basis of our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, if we come to a place where Christ is not named, we must preach the gospel, win men to the Lord, and found a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we come to a place where there are already Christians, but on various grounds these believers separate themselves into denominational "churches," our task is just the same as in the other place we must preach the gospel, lead men to the Lord, and form them into a church on the scriptural ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the while we must maintain an attitude of inclusiveness, not exclusiveness, towards those believers who are in different sects, for they, as we, are children of God, and they live in the same locality; therefore, they belong to the same church as we do.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For ourselves, we cannot join any sect or remain in one, for our church connection can only be on local ground, but in regard to others we must not make leaving a sect the condition of fellowship with those believers who are in a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That will make undenominationalism our church ground, instead of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us be clear on this point, that an undenominational church is not a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is a vast difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A local church is undenominational, and it is positive and inclusive; but an undenominational church is not a local church, and it is negative and exclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Let us be clear as to our position.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not out to establish undenominational churches, but local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are seeking to do a positive work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If believers can be led to see what a local church is the expression of the Body of Christ in a locality they will certainly not remain in any sect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the other hand, it is possible for them to see all the evils of sectarianism, and leave them, without knowing what a local church is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must help those, to whom God has been pleased to use us, to understand clearly the truth regarding local churches, and not to lay emphasis on the question of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They must realize that whenever they use the term "we" in relation to the children of God, they must include all the children of God, not merely those who are meeting with them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If when we say "our brethren," we do not include all the children of God, but only those who continually meet with us, then we are schismatic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not condone sectarianism, and I do not believe we should belong to any sect, but it is not our business to get people to leave them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we make it our chief concern to lead people to a real knowledge of the Lord and the power of His cross, then they will gladly abandon themselves to Him, and will learn to walk in the Spirit, repudiating the things of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We shall find there will be no need to stress the question of denominations, for the Spirit Himself will enlighten them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If a believer has not learned the way of the cross and the walk in the Spirit, what is gained by his coming out of a sect?</S>
