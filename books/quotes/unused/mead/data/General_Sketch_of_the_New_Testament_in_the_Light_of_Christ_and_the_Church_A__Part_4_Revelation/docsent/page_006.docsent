   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR THE EPISTLES TO THE SEVEN CHURCHES 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 2:18 3:22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Revelation is a book of prophecy in symbols, and the seven epistles in chapters two and three contain many symbols.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we understand them only according to the words, they are not as meaningful, but when we understand them according to the symbols, they are much more meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The titles, names, and events in these chapters are symbols, showing us that by the third stage of the church the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans had caused the church to change in form and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the degradation of the church, the church and government with its politics were improperly mixed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was according to the teaching of Balaam 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By this teaching the church was united with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was spiritual fornication, and along with this there was also idol worship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can trace this progress in the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition, there was also the teaching of the Nicolaitans v. 15 , the teaching of the hierarchy, the difference between the clergy and the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nicolaitans is derived from two Greek roots nikao, meaning to subdue or conquer and laos, meaning laity or common people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It denotes the subduing of the laity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This resulted in a clerical class, an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This brought something of Judaism into Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was another improper mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The teaching of Balaam brought the church into union with the world, and the teaching of the Nicolaitans mixed the church with Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>History tells us that during the fourth, fifth, and sixth centuries, these things happened exactly in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church adopted the forms and rituals of Judaism as well as some of its terminology and titles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE CHURCH IN THYATIRA</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fourth epistle is to the church in Thyatira vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>18-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>History tells us that about two centuries after Constantine made Christianity the state religion of the Roman Empire, in the latter part of the sixth century, this state religion became the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the bishop of Rome began to be considered as the pope, the Roman Catholic Church was officially and formally formed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This began another stage of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Roman Catholic Church was prophesied by the Lord in Matthew 13:33, in which a woman took leaven and added it to fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This woman is the evil Jezebel in Revelation 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jezebel was the pagan wife of Ahab, king of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By her marriage to Ahab, the people of the kingdom of God became mixed with paganism.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the eyes of the Lord, the Roman Catholic Church became the same as this woman, bringing many heathen practices into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Jezebel calls herself a prophetess, teaching the Lord s people v. 20 . According to the principle in the New Testament, the Lord never allows a woman to teach with authority 1 Tim 2:12 . In the same way, the church itself must not teach, because in the eyes of the Lord the church is in the position of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only the Lord Himself is the man, the one who has the right to teach, the right to say yes or no, right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, according to history and the present situation, people in Catholicism say, The church says....</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is hard to convince people in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we tell them, The Bible says, they answer, The church says.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No matter how many passages we quote from the Scriptures, they have one reply: The church says.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way, they do not care for the Bible; they care only for what the church says.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church has the highest authority; whatever the church says is right.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This church is the evil woman, Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Roman Catholic Church is a teaching woman.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By the teaching of this woman, many pagan and heathen things were brought into the church, causing fornication and idol worship Rev 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The famous Roman Catholic cathedrals are full of idolatry, containing images of Peter, Paul, and many other so-called saints, as well as of Jesus and Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many people come into these churches with candles just to worship these idols.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many of the evil mysteries within the Catholic Church have been exposed by writings in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we read the history of the church, we will discover the actual fulfillment of the prophecy of the Lord in this epistle to Thyatira.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Matthew 13:33 a woman takes leaven and hides it in three measures of meal; in Revelation 17:1-6 the evil woman is riding on a beast; and in 2:20-23 this same woman is called Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These three women all refer to the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the Roman Catholic Church that brings leaven into the fine flour, it is the Roman Catholic Church that is the harlot riding on the beast, and it is the Roman Catholic Church that is Jezebel, corrupting Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1929 Mussolini signed an agreement to give the Vatican to the pope as his territory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From that time the Vatican became an independent state with its own jurisdiction, conducting diplomatic affairs.</S>
