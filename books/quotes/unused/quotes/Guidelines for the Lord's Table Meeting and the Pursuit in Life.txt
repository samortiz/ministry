The content of the church is Christ, and the intrinsic reality of every single matter in the church is Christ Himself
Once we mention the breaking of bread, almost all Christians will say that breaking bread is for remembering the Lord
Based on this word, many Christians conclude that the significance of bread breaking is the remembrance of the Lord
We feel that we need to contemplate His burial, His resurrection, His ascension, and His sending of the Holy Spirit
The Lord did not tell the disciples that at the Lord's table they had to quiet their hearts to meditate on Him in remembrance of Him
If He had not died or shed His blood, He could not have any relationship with us and would not have a way to enter into us
Now whenever we turn to our spirit believing and receiving the Lord who died and shed His blood for us we eat His flesh and drink His blood
We believe that in His body He bore our sins on the cross, that He died for us, and that His blood was shed for us on the cross
In God's eyes, when we believe and receive the Lord in this way, we are eating His flesh and drinking His blood
To eat the Lord's flesh and drink the Lord's blood is to receive the Lord Himself as our enjoyment, our life within, and our food
In the past when we remembered the Lord, many of our concepts were religious and much of our remembrance was in our mind
Only when we use our spirit and are in our spirit can we touch the Lord, worship the Lord, and genuinely remember the Lord
The bread and cup that we touch outwardly signify His body that was given for us and His blood that was shed for us
Now we not only receive the visible bread and cup outwardly, but at the same time, we also touch and receive the Lord Himself in our spirit
After the Lord's table and after this meditation and prayer in his mind, he still had not been touched by the Lord inwardly
If we truly know what it means to remember the Lord, we will definitely eat and drink to our heart's content at the Lord's table
Every time we remember the Lord, we will be able to say with boldness that all of our hunger and thirst are fully satisfied
When people ask us about what we are eating and drinking, we can tell them readily that we are eating and drinking the Lord Jesus
Many Christians do not understand the reason they need to meet, but meetings are of supreme importance to Christians
When they gathered together, either the priests or the prophets would instruct them according to the teachings of God
After the children of Israel returned from their captivity, Ezra gathered them together and read the law to them
God's people gathered together even in heavy rain to deal with their transgression against God until the whole matter was resolved
In the same chapter He also said that if an offending brother refuses to hear the brothers reproof the brothers should tell it to the church
Even though there was no such title as the church, the gathering of those called out by God was the church, the assembly
A good meeting can be of tremendous help to a Christian, and a poor meeting can cause much harm to a Christian
If our meetings are burdensome, we need to correct and adjust the meetings so that the saints do not suffer loss
We should never take the meetings lightly, thinking that we can come in a casual way without living in fellowship with the Lord
Whenever we enter a meeting, we need to touch the atmosphere and spirit of the meeting in a spirit of fellowship
The problem with many saints is that they neither care for the spirit of the meeting nor touch the atmosphere of the meeting
A brother, unaware of the spirit and the atmosphere of the meeting, may select an irrelevant hymn as he enters the meeting
We must put aside our personal feeling and be sensitive to touch the atmosphere of the meeting by the spirit of fellowship
We should do this in the Lord's table meeting, the prayer meeting, the fellowship meeting, and the meeting for the ministry of the word
Sometimes when we are talking with others, we must drop what we intended to say because the atmosphere is inappropriate
At that moment we need to observe the countenances of others, touch their feelings, and then speak accordingly
In conclusion, when we come to a meeting, we must exercise our living spirit within to touch the spirit and atmosphere of the meeting
Only when we have inwardly touched the atmosphere do we have anything to express, either by selecting a hymn or offering a prayer
We must prepare ourselves and open our spirit so that the Holy Spirit can use us as a channel to speak for Him
The primary reason the responsible brothers sit in the first row should be for the convenience of making announcements
Otherwise, ten years from now, all the elders will be sitting in the front row and will consider that they are leading the meeting
When we come to the Lord's table, we should not have a concept regarding who should sit at the front and who should sit at the back
The new believers, the newly saved ones, should sit at the front with those who have been saved for a longer time
Almost every time, one of the responsible brothers selects a hymn at the beginning of the meeting, and then everyone else joins in to sing
The leading ones among us should not nullify the spirit of the brothers and sisters by serving as priests on their behalf
The responsible brothers in all the localities should avoid replacing the saints in selecting hymns at the beginning of a meeting
In this matter the sisters are not excluded; they can also pray and sing according to the moving of the Spirit
The responsible brothers are responsible for the administration of the church, that is, to take the lead in administrating the church
At the end of the Lord's table meeting a responsible brother can stand up and make the announcements concerning the move of the church
We must have knowledge of the different categories of the hymns if we want to select proper hymns in a meeting
In selecting hymns, we must be clear concerning the different categories of hymns and also know the atmosphere and progression of a meeting
When someone selects the wrong hymn and the singing begins to drag, there is the need to turn by selecting another hymn
The ninth kind of hymn is a concluding hymn, and the tenth kind of hymn is a lingering hymn, a hymn for lingering before sending people off
Sometimes a meeting has ended, yet it seems that the meeting is still not over; at such times there is the need for a 'sending off' hymn
The second hymn brings the saints into the central subject of a meeting, leading them into the spirit of a meeting
If we are not familiar with the hymns and expect to be inspired by the Holy Spirit, we are waiting for a miracle
If all the brothers and sisters sense that the Lord is full of glory and honor, then they can sing Hymns, 127, and continue with Hymns, 183
To do this, however, we must have some spiritual skill, and the spirit of the meeting must also be able to keep pace
The leading brothers, in particular, must spend time in this matter; otherwise, their work will be meaningless
Sometimes we lead the saints to consecrate themselves and to begin with their spirit, but we have not led them to deal with sins
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
Much of the grace a Christian receives is in the meetings, and much of the work the Lord does is also in the meetings
At the same time, based on our burden, we can fellowship with them in order to gain a better understanding of their situation
We can pray for them to have a heart for the Lord, and we can help them fulfill their desire and goal toward the Lord
In addition to praying for the saints, we can also fellowship and talk with them before and after the meetings
We may also write them to share what we have heard and enjoyed in the meetings, thereby keeping in touch with them
Besides praying for and fellowshipping with the saints, in the church life we should also learn to bear responsibility for the meetings
If the Holy Spirit cannot find channels in a meeting, the saints whom we bring to the meeting will not be moved or benefited
Everyone who has been to a 'Sunday service' in the denominations knows that there are pastors who lead the meetings
To practice this in the Lords table fellowship and prayer meetings is altogether contrary to the nature of meetings as revealed in the Bible
All the saints should come together and follow the leading of the Holy Spirit for the Lord's table, fellowship, and prayer meetings
When we come to a meeting to pray and worship God, we all have an equal standing; we are all brothers and sisters
Sometimes for convenience in the service, the brother who makes announcements may sit in the front, but this is not always necessary
If the elders and responsible brothers would not take the lead, the whole meeting will be left without anyone to bear the burden
If we do not have fellowship with the Lord before coming to a meeting, our spirit will be deadened and lack vitality
They hurriedly rush to the meeting without bearing any burden for the meeting and their spirit is still closed
Since a few brothers will take the lead to select a hymn and to pray, the rest of the saints can relax and enjoy
We will be a channel for the Holy Spirit, and He will be able to use us as a channel to bear responsibility for the meeting
We need to know the hymns in their categories; second, we need to know the progression of singing in a meeting
Otherwise, we may touch the Lord's presence and sense His glory yet select a hymn on rising up to preach the gospel
After an opening hymn is sung and a strong prayer is offered, the second hymn should bring the meeting to its subject
Even though we use hymns and prayers to maintain the spirit, there may still be the need to fill up the time with more prayers and singing
Sometimes even though the meeting has ended, there is still a lingering air; thus, we may select another hymn to send the saints off
We often have the sense at the end of the Lord's table meeting that everyone wishes the meeting could continue
The Holy Spirit will then come to yet another brother, who also may not think that the meeting is his responsibility
If such a situation continues, many brothers and sisters may find it unbearable and stop coming to the meeting
Also, if we do not know the categories of hymns, the nature of the hymns, it will be difficult for us to consider other matters
A meeting does not always require this many sections, but in general it may consist of not more than these ten sections
If the spirit of the meeting is not strong enough after the introduction, we need to call a strengthening hymn
During a meeting that is prolonged, there may be the need for a hymn to maintain the spirit, to prevent the spirit from being weakened
It is not a general hymn but rather has a specific purpose; such a hymn can be used in leading to a particular subject
Hymns, 693, 'He faileth not, for He is God,' is not that suitable because the train of thought in this hymn does not match our subject
Hymns, 437, 'Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him,' is also inappropriate because the feeling of this hymn is very high
In the fellowship meeting, which does not have a particular subject, we should not use hymns that have a specific subject
Hymns, 720, 'God hath not promised skies always blue, / Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through,' is not suitable
Hymns, 492, 'In all thy work, O Lord, Thou didst,' is a very deep hymn with a specific subject; hence, it is not suitable as an opening hymn
When we think of Thee, / Of all Thy love and grace,' is toward the Lord; hence, it cannot be used as an opening hymn in a fellowship meeting
Hymns, 397, 'More holiness give me,' can be sung at the beginning of a fellowship meeting when there is a feeling of insipidness
When we choose a hymn in this way, the feeling will be expressed and will flow out through the singing of the congregation
Suppose there is a general feeling of insipidness in a meeting; if a hymn is selected that is very solemn, no one will be able to follow
When people are sad, we should choose hymns of sorrow; when people are joyful, we should choose hymns of rejoicing
We urgently need to be trained in these three matters: first, how to work; second, how to lead; and third, how to manage
Leading the meetings is not the responsibility of the elders and deacons only; it is the responsibility of all the saints
Although there may be no particular feeling at the beginning of a fellowship meeting, the principle for selecting hymns still applies
Because this is a specific hymn, it should not be called at the beginning of a fellowship meeting, a meeting without a particular feeling
The principle of choosing hymns is that we should choose a hymn according to the feeling we sense in the meeting
We may pray, 'O Lord, we were so indifferent when we came before You, yet Your love toward us has never changed
The meeting will then have a center, a subject, which is the Lord's dearness to us and His love for us to the uttermost
Hymns, 286, 'Of Jesus' love that sought me,' is very good as a continuation of the opening hymn, hymn 352 in the Chinese hymnal
We have said repeatedly that selecting hymns is a matter of feeling; hence, we need to touch the feeling of the spirit
If we are indifferent when we come together for a fellowship meeting, there is a need for someone to touch a particular feeling
After we sing this hymn with such feeling, we should immediately follow with a prayer, thanking the Lord for His unchanging love
When we touch the atmosphere, the feeling, we can select an appropriate hymn from our memory that matches the feeling we sense
Since a hymn is for the expression of feelings, we must touch the feeling of the ones who are singing when we select a hymn
If a hymn matches the feeling of those who are singing, they will be released and will express their inner feeling through the hymn
We need to be familiar with these points then when we touch a certain feeling in a meeting we will be able to select a hymn from our memory
One time there were many attendants in a Lord's table meeting, but the atmosphere of the meeting was plain and somewhat indifferent
We should not ignore the atmosphere in a meeting, paying attention merely to our feeling and praying formal, conventional prayers
We see that this bread is the body You gave for us, and this cup is the blood of the covenant, the blood You shed for us
Regarding the Lord's human living, Hymns, 87 says that the Lord showed His faithfulness to God and His wondrous love and grace to men
We remember the Lord for the things that transpired in the past, and we look forward to His coming back, which is something in the future
There are many small items, such as the Lord's humility, the Lord's washing His disciples' feet, and the Lord's appearing to Mary
If we sing Hymns 213 followed by Hymns 158 to bring in a subject we are remembering the third item of the Lord the Lords death in His work
In order to not allow the spirit to be weakened when we pass the bread and cup, we need to select a hymn that can maintain the spirit
At this point the selection of a hymn greatly depends on the prayers offered during the blessing of the bread and the cup
After singing Hymns, 158, someone may bless the bread and the cup, praying, 'O Lord, thank You for first remembering us
In such a case it would be good if someone selected Hymns, 95, 'O Head once full of bruises, / So full of pain and scorn'
If we want to touch the feeling of a meeting, we must at least understand the meaning expressed through the words of the hymns
If we select Hymns, 178, 'Our hearts are full of Christ and long / Their glorious matter to declare,' we will certainly go backward
When we worship the Father, we often call Hymns, 33 or Hymns, 52, without paying attention to the theme of our remembrance of the Lord
Even though Hymns, 299, 'A mind at perfect peace with God,' is not a hymn on the worship of the Father, it can be used
After singing this hymn, it would be good if someone were to stand up and pray, 'O Father, thank You for sending the Lord Jesus to seek us
Soon before Thy throne assembled, / All Thy children shall proclaim / Abba's love shown in redemption, / And how full is Abba's name'!
It is good for a brother to choose Hymns, 45, but we should avoid singing two hymns of a similar nature in succession
She was not moved to tears while praying; rather, she had tears in her eyes when she was on her way to the meeting
At the last stanza, when we are uplifted in our spirit, a brother may take the lead to stand up to bless the bread and the cup
Criticism comes out of the flesh and is the issue of partaking of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which opens people's eyes
If we can pray Lord we are here to remember You because in the evening when You departed from us You left us with a charge to remember You
It reaches the point where we sense that the Lord is remembering us, and in this remembrance we have fellowship with Him
In the New Testament, Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus, in the flesh, also offered praise that was high in quality
Although the Lord's table meeting and the prayer meeting are different in their nature, content, and items, their course is the same
We can also sing Hymns, 880; this hymn strengthens the brothers and sisters in their inner feeling to oppose Satan
If the meeting has a lingering taste, and there is a need to send people off, we can sing the chorus of Hymns, 890 again
From now on the responsible brothers should practice selecting hymns in all the fellowship meetings of the church
It is acceptable to sing slowly when we are alone, but if we sing slowly in a big meeting, the whole meeting will be finished
In a meeting all those who know how to sing should lead the singing, and those who do not know how to sing should not begin a tune
If we consider these exercises for the meetings as something too difficult and not worthwhile, there is nothing further to say
Usually, at the beginning of the table meeting everyone feels quite ordinary; we do not have any particular feeling
After the first prayer, someone else should follow with a second hymn or a second prayer, and perhaps there should be a third prayer
The present situation in our meetings is that we have one beginning after another, with each person making his own move
As we move forward in the meeting, we must learn to maintain the feeling of the meeting in our prayers and hymns
As we move forward in selecting a hymn, and especially when we pray, we should bring the brothers and sisters with us
The brothers and sisters may not be uplifted in their spirit before we pray, but after we pray, their spirits should climb higher and higher
Suppose the brothers and sisters are in the feeling of the Lord's suffering, yet our prayer is concerning the Lord's glorification in heaven
According to our feeling we have already climbed up to heaven, but the brothers and sisters are still prostrate on earth
In a three-legged race, we must take care of our partner who is bound to us; we cannot simply run as fast as we wish
Although she was a Canaanite woman when she came to pray before the Lord Jesus her prayer was poetic Have mercy on me Lord Son of David!
The Lord did not do this; rather, He replied in a mild way, 'It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs'
The Canaanite woman's answer was very proper: 'Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table'
There is no direct mention of the daughter's problem, yet the purpose of the entire conversation is for the daughter
A person with much feeling tends to be poetic in utterance, whereas a person with little feeling tends to be rough in his expressions
The more a person touches God, the richer his feeling will be, and consequently, the more poetic his utterances will be
Do not think that merely being poetic is good enough; the most important thing concerning prayer is that it should touch people's spirit
The more we are in the spirit, the more feeling we have; the less we are in the spirit, the less feeling we have
The more we pray by the spirit, the more feeling we will have, and consequently, our utterances will be more poetic
If our prayer is full of poetical utterance, it is easier for us to touch the spirit and the feeling of the saints
When we come before the Lord to speak to Him, our utterances should be full of poetic qualities and rich in feeling
Our prayers should not only move forward and upward, they should also bring the atmosphere of the meeting to the subject of the meeting
After a few hymns and prayers, we should bring the meeting toward the bread and the cup, to the feeling of breaking the bread
After singing, someone should offer a prayer of blessing to receive the bread and the cup from the Lord's hand
We should avoid formal prayers at the table meeting; instead, we should use words of revelation and words that convey spiritual facts
When we pray, we should simply say, 'O Lord, we thank You for the bread and for the cup; we are here in remembrance of You
We can also say, 'O Lord, our hearts are filled with sweetness as we sing with our mouths and behold the bread and the cup with our eyes
Before You died on the cross, we did not know how far away we were from God, and we did not even realize that we were sinners'
In this way, we are immediately connected to the feeling and subject of the meeting and thereby enable the saints to touch something
We may tell them that the meeting hall on Ren-ai Road is made of wood and has many glass doors and windows that face different directions
We may bring them to hall one and say, 'Look at the doors, the windows, the courtyard, and the inside furnishing'
One day he visits the brother and says, 'Brother, there is a Taiwanese sister; she is tall and has large eyes'
We do not give others the feeling that the Lord is right in front of us and that we are gazing at Him while speaking of His glory
In Genesis 18 Abraham did not pray, 'O God, You are righteous'; rather, he prayed, 'Shall the Judge of all the earth not do justly'?
Most doctrinal prayers lack poetic qualities, and many prayers of revelation are full of poetic characteristics
If we stand on our relationship with the Lord and pray according to this relationship, it is easy to pray with revelation
It is not that glory has been transferred to us from eternity future; rather, the eternal glory is now intimately related to us
We need to give the brothers and sisters a feeling that the glory we enjoy today is not objective but subjective
We may pray, 'Lord, You formerly walked on the earth, but now You are in glory, and You still possess human nature
If You were in glory but did not possess human nature, we would not be able to sense how dear and near You are to us
Such a prayer brings our feeling into glory; moreover, this glory is seemingly objective but is actually subjective
When we pray, it is difficult for us to touch the subject of the meeting or sense that the spirit of the meeting has advanced
Please remember that it is best for any prayers offered after a hymn to follow the feeling conveyed in the hymn
When we reach a high point in the spirit in our singing, we need a prayer to sustain the spirit of the meeting
The author of the hymn does not need to say anything except, 'Gazing on it we adore Thee, / Blessed, precious, holy Lord'
A brother may be inspired to add a short hymn and select the last stanza of Hymns, 182, which reads, 'Praise Him!
If, however, there is still time after singing Hymns, 136 and offering prayers, we can sing hymns to fill the gap
It says, 'Jesus, Thy head, once crown'd with thorns, / Is crown'd with glory now; / Heaven's royal diadem adorns / The mighty Victor's brow
Thou glorious light of courts above, / Joy of the saints below, / To us still manifest Thy love, / That we its depths may know'
We not only enjoy glory but also suffer shame, because today we are still on earth, and we need to despise the favor of the world
The praying one may say, 'Lord, now that we have seen Your glory, how can we not treasure the path of the cross'?
Such praise turns the entire meeting from the first section to the second section, from remembering the Lord to worshipping the Father
It would be very elegant and beautiful for us to sing a hymn after such praise and continue with two more prayers
The most precious point concerning a meeting is that we learn to touch the atmosphere, the feeling, of the meeting
Whereas initiating prayer is for revelation, expressive prayer is a speaking forth, to pray forth the sense that is within everyone
Our spirit of worship cannot make a proper turn if we are not properly motivated therefore there is a need for motivating and strengthening
It is not that we lack a burden in our spirit to pray; rather, it is that we do not have the utterance for prayer or a reserve for prayer
We do not merely need to exercise our praying spirit; much more, we must seize each opportunity to exercise out of our reserve of prayer
At this time someone needs to create a feeling of praise to the Father and motivate and draw out the worship of the Father
Some of the prayers in the table meeting are initiating prayers; they speak forth a feeling that was not previously present in the meeting
Even though no one was with us, we considered that the brothers and sisters were before our eyes and that we were speaking to them
We know that the Lord Jesus is within us and among us; we are not simply praying to the air with our eyes closed
We should not say that no one has seen this matter in the last two thousand years, but we can say that very few have seen this
Christians must have the realization that man's natural concept is a problem that hinders Christ from living in them
After salvation, some saints think that it is good to never lose their temper, and others focus on the way of the church
Apparently these are good concepts, but in those who love the Lord, these concepts are the biggest enemies of Christ and hinder Him the most
There must be a day when God shows us that we have nothing, that we are good for nothing, and that we are devoid of any merit
There must be a day when the Spirit of God shows us that the greatest hindrance to Christ's being lived out of us is our self
Whenever we draw near to the Lord, we have the hope that our temper will be improved, and we therefore ask the Lord to help us
We need the Lord to open our eyes to see that even such a little hope is a natural concept that can be a hindrance to the Lord
It is right for us to consecrate ourselves to the Lord, but we need to drop our desire to do something for Him
If we hand ourselves over to Christ without bringing along our own terms desires and intentions He will be able to do what He desires in us
We need strong light from the Lord to show us that the way to enter into God's life depends upon our seeing these two points
If we have some imitation eggs that look exactly the same as real eggs, they will not hatch because they are void of life
When this one, who once held his brother's heel as a supplanter and a deceitful man, ceased his doing, God's mercy was manifested in him
There he wrestled with God; it seemed that God could not subdue him, but in the end God caused him to be crippled
No one knows how long it will take for us to stop ourselves; perhaps it will not happen until we are thirty, forty, or fifty years old
It is not easy for us to stop ourselves after only half a year or even a year; we need to pass through quite a long time
Question: Does our stopping need to pass through the experience in Romans 7:25-'through Jesus Christ our Lord'?
Although we are responsible for preaching the gospel and for speaking, the Holy Spirit can work what we have preached and spoken into people
Suppose we give a message that we must see the vision, consecrate ourselves, believe, and obey in order to let Christ live in us
Related to consecration, he does not say that we need to present something; rather, he uses the word surrender instead of consecration
When we truly have a vision of Christ, our entire being will be stopped, and we will see that Christ wants to live in us
We need to pursue having a heart for the Lord, a heart that loves Him, yet we should realize our pursuing and running are useless
These ones repeatedly pointed out that the way of revival is not the best way for God to accomplish His purpose
The way of revival can cause the church to increase in number, but it cannot cause the Body of Christ to increase in stature
We must let the Lord come in to show all who have a heart for Him what He wants to accomplish in His eternal plan
In mainland China a great number of people were saved through the revival work of John Sung, who is a perfect example of a revivalist
After Wang Mingtao left two months later the spirit would dry up and leak away and the number of people attending meetings would also drop
Consequently, elders and pastors would meet to discuss the situation and then send a cable to invite Brother So-and-so from Canton
The preaching of the gospel is to find material; the bringing of people to the knowledge of Christ is to build up these materials
The extent to which the saints can be built up and edified in the church depends upon how much we know Christ inwardly
If the saints do not have an adequate inward knowledge of Christ, what else can be done other than revival works?
No virtue can replace Christ, not even our zeal, patience, humility, or kindness; only Christ Himself is Christ
They seem to think that if they had not failed, that is, if they were all right, they would not need to hand themselves over
As far as God's original intention is concerned, we must still hand ourselves over no matter what our condition is, even if it is the best
His original purpose in His plan is to work His life into us; this has nothing to do with whether we are weak or strong
Even though Adam had not yet fallen and was not yet weak, he was placed in front of the tree of life in order to receive God as life
People analyze whether their experience of the cross is subjective or objective because they lack adequate light regarding the cross
One evening in 1945 a brother heard over the radio that the Japanese emperor would announce an unconditional surrender on August 14
On the cross, not only were we crucified, but the flesh, the self, and everything in the universe were dealt with by the cross
When Japan surrendered, all her people, including the emperor, great officials, and even small soldiers, were finished
Question: Is there a distinction between receiving that is according to knowledge and receiving that is according to the spirit?
When people heard of Japan's declaration of surrender, did anyone wonder whether he received the news as knowledge or in the spirit?
We have these kinds of questions in our mind because we have not seen the Lord's all-inclusive death on the cross
The older brother says that it is difficult to receive the gospel, but at the same time the younger brother says that it is easy
It is strange, however, that some people's minds are clear when we speak concerning subjects such as engineering, machinery, and economics
Paul's responsibility was to write the Epistle, but whether or not the saints would know the Lord Jesus depended on God's mercy
They may have heard the words of the faith many years ago, but in their mind they have one question after another
Question: In the Old Testament God's work in man was outward, but in the New Testament it seems that God's work in man is inward
In the New Testament in order for God to gain man, He gives the Holy Spirit to man and puts His life within man
Even though they were able to enjoy only the part of the land they walked on, the entire land of Canaan was for their enjoyment
Since our knowledge and comprehension of salvation are very limited by our natural concepts, God gives us more of His divine speaking
At the same time He shows that not only were we finished on the cross, but all things were dealt with on the cross
The only reason we think that we are poor is because we have not seen the full salvation that God has given us in His plan
In the universe, according to Chinese philosophy, there are yin and yang, males and females, the sun and the moon
In spiritual matters, from God's side, everything is related to His mercy; from man's side, everything is related to man's responsibility
From Gods side if He had not predestinated us to enter His kingdom we would be unable to enter regardless of how much we strive and struggle
Some say that salvation is a matter of God's predestination, and others say that it is a matter of man's responsibility
From the side of God in heaven, it is God's predestination; from the side of man on earth, it is man's responsibility
To yield thirtyfold is good, to yield sixtyfold is better, to yield a hundredfold is the best, yet to yield nothing is the worst
Whether a seed can grow is God's responsibility, but whether a seed can be sown into man is man's responsibility
Whether or not God allows us to hear His word is His responsibility, but whether we receive His word is our responsibility
The Lord Jesus once said of the Jews that although they had seen Him in the flesh, they had not really seen Him
It is only when God pulls open the veil in heaven, making known to us the heavenly mysteries, that we can know Christ and His cross
If we want to see an object, it must first be placed before us; then, we need eyes that can see; and finally, there must be light
At this time our eyes must be open to see, and there must be the shining of light to enable us to see this spiritual matter
If we have sight, we will see His all-inclusiveness; we will see that His death is all-inclusive and that His riches are all-inclusive
After hearing a message concerning the four living creatures represented by a man a lion an ox and an eagle some may ask What about fish
None of the truths, not even the truth related to Christ or His cross, can enter into us if all we have are questions
We need to see that all these troubling and distracting thoughts hinder us from seeing clearly; hence, we do not have a vision
Writers always like to make inferences, but it is altogether wrong to make inferences in relation to seeing a vision
On Gods side there is no problem with revelation and light on our side however very few of us actually have eyes to see and ears to hear
According to what you have seen, you think that you could fail and be discouraged, but you still want to go forward by faith
Since what you have seen is not thorough or sufficient, you will fall, but after falling you will still want to rise up by faith
The revelation is here, and light is here, but if we want to see, we need the light of God to shine on our inner eyes
Eventually, you need to realize that even after such prayer, we must still bear the responsibility for our seeing
We must stop our distracting thoughts and learn to simply follow the light that the Lord has given us; the simpler we are, the better
We should not think that we have not received anything simply because we did not have an overwhelming experience
Another brother is excited and joyful after listening to the message, because he has clearly seen that he has been crucified with Christ
When he arrives home and his wife loses her temper with him, he tells himself that he must not react because of what he has seen
When food enters our stomach, are we in control of how long the food will stay in our stomach before entering the intestines?
Does it do any good to rebuke the food for lingering too long in our stomach or to tell it to enter quickly into the intestines?
The Lord, who is in us, bears the full responsibility for us, and His word of life is like a seed that is sown into us
If a brother comes to us and says that he has the faith and the seeing, his faith and seeing are surely man-made
Those who analyze with their mind often think that they are clear, but actual seeing does not necessarily involve much feeling
When this seed is sown, we may call it seeing or receiving, and we may also say that this seed has been sown or shined into us
Even though we may not have any feeling outwardly, within us there is a spiritual fact that cannot be denied, nullified, or overthrown
When food enters into us and supplies us inwardly, we do not have much feeling; it is at a time of hunger that we have feeling
He may not realize that it is the Holy Spirit activating the effectiveness of Christ's death on the cross within him
Question: In Acts 9, when the apostle Paul met the Lord on the way to Damascus, did the Lord appear to him inwardly or outwardly?
If we were to ask Paul where God revealed His Son in him, he would say that it was in Damascus at the time Ananias laid his hands on him
Paul could say that although it was Ananias who laid his hands on him, from that point on, it was God who revealed His Son in him
The story of Paul on the road to Damascus simply shows that we need to be met by the Lord before we can meet Him inwardly
In order to carry out this procedure, one day Christ became flesh; He came to be a man, joining Himself with His creatures
The process of His death was not completed when He was born into humanity; it merely became a possibility for Him
Even though His physical death was not yet accomplished, He was already living in it for thirty-three and a half years
If He had not died on the cross, He could not have made His death available for us to enjoy, even though He lived His life in death
God in His eternal plan determined to perform a great 'surgery' to terminate all things through the death of the cross
In the same way although the Lord Jesus lived in death this death was not displayed or accomplished as a fact a procedure in the universe
After thirty-three and a half years, He went to Golgotha to fully accomplish this death; then He transmitted it to us in His resurrection
Because the Lord has given us His life of death and resurrection, this life causes us to be united with His death
We need to see that the cross does not merely touch our behavior; it works so deeply that it touches us even in the matter of serving God
Whenever we are about to speak to a brother, there will be an inward operation, asking, 'Does this word come from you or from God?
Question: What is the difference between the killing of the cross and our submission to the discipline of the Holy Spirit?
In this way, when we receive dealings in the environment, not only are we without murmuring, but we also rejoice
Our way does not depend on asking or begging but on seeing that we have already died on the cross and have no way to escape His death
In the death of the cross we see that all that the cross has accomplished, delivered, solved, judged, and dealt with is our portion
Romans 6:3 says, 'Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
After we believed in the Lord, He put us into the death of Christ, and from that point forward we could begin to obey God
We told him that he needed to be baptized and that the meaning of baptism was to die and be buried with Christ
Saul of Tarsus, a well-known person throughout the centuries, was breathing threatening on his way to Damascus
If we are willing to stop for a little, God's light will shine in us a little; if God's light shines in us more, we will see more
When we stop ourselves a little, God will speak to us a little; if we receive His speaking, we will continue to stop ourselves
As far as the experience of the cross is concerned, is the filling of the Holy Spirit an inward filling or an outward pouring?
After the Lord's crucifixion the Holy Spirit was manifested on the evening of the day of the Lord's resurrection and on the day of Pentecost
According to the truth, it is one thing for the Holy Spirit to dwell in man, and it is another for the Holy Spirit to come upon man
On the day of the Lord's resurrection, the Lord breathed into His disciples and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Forty days later, however, the Lord told them that the Holy Spirit had not yet come and that they were to wait for the Holy Spirit
The book The Spirit of Christ says that the Keswick Convention also has branch associations in India and South Africa
In other words if a person wants to have the strength to take the Lords way the presence of the Lord and light he must consecrate himself
In the meetings many brothers and sisters have been touched by the Lord to kneel down and consecrate themselves to Him
In the end, however, the more people appreciate this kind of speaking, the more difficult it will be for them to see
The word of the cross requires our eyes to be opened to see a spiritual matter; hence, seeing is such a great matter
Some people say that chapter 7 is Paul's experience after his salvation, and others say that it is his experience prior to his salvation
In other words, we can read chapter 8 immediately following chapter 6, because chapter 8 is the continuation of chapter 6
It seemed as if the law was helping him, but in reality it was doing him harm; there was nothing he could do to fulfill the law
In verse 22, Paul said that he delighted in the law of God according to the inner man; then in verse 23, he referred to the law of his mind
We consider that we have a body outwardly, which is called the outer man, and that we have two parts inwardly, the soul and the spirit
We cannot say that the inner man in Romans 7 refers to the person in our spirit simply because 2 Corinthians 4:16 mentions the inner man
Although Romans 7 speaks of Paul's experience prior to his salvation, for many of us it is our experience after salvation
Question: How do we experience Romans 8:6: 'For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace'?
They did not know God's salvation; rather, according to their natural concept, they tried to do good and keep the law
Many of us who have never heard the gospel already know that certain matters are wrong, and we also have a sense within us
We must see that the struggle in Romans 7 is different from the war between the Holy Spirit and the flesh in Galatians 5
The struggle in Romans 7 is not spiritual; it is a struggle between the mind with its reason and the flesh with its lust
Consequently in the 'right' circumstances covetousness will be activated in us, and we will fail in spite of all our attempts to not covet
In the 'right' circumstance, we may be shaken inwardly; the more we try not to covet a particular thing, the more actively we will covet it
Romans 6:3 says, 'Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
To be baptized into Christ's death is to be baptized into Christ, that is, to grow together with Him in His death and resurrection
Since we have been saved and baptized into Christ Jesus, we should know that we are in Christ, yet we are not clear about this
The first item of our experience in chapter 8 is related to our eyes being opened to see that we are in Christ Jesus
As far as our fallen flesh is concerned, we belong to Satan; however, the divine life is in our regenerated spirit
Whether we follow Satan by standing with our flesh or follow God by standing with our spirit, it all depends on us
Every time he struggles, he is attacked and defeated; therefore, he must dutifully surrender to the flesh, to Satan
In the experience of Romans 7 when a man struggles trying not to covet or not to have filthy thoughts the cat immediately pounces on him
In our experience we do not enter into the experience of chapter 8 because we have had sufficient failures in chapter 7
Because the law of the Spirit of life indwelt him, in every circumstance he endeavored to set his mind on the spirit, not the flesh
As we receive more dealings and have more experiences inwardly, however, it will become easier to set our mind on the spirit
Not only so, after the fall, man's mind replaced the spirit's leading function and subdued the soul so that the soul also followed the flesh
In our experience, if we live by our flesh, it is unlikely that we will receive the outpouring of the Spirit of God
Even if the Holy Spirit descended upon us, if we are living by our flesh, we would apply this power in an improper way
The fishermen of Galilee left their hometown, relatives, and occupation and followed Jesus the Nazarene with no reservation
In the Lord's resurrection they received the Holy Spirit and were able to live before the Lord by the Holy Spirit in them
In Acts 1, those who received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit were those who were praying in the upper room in Jerusalem
Only such ones are qualified to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and can properly use the Holy Spirit who is outpoured upon them
When the Holy Spirit is poured out upon them, they are puffed up because they have received the gift of the Holy Spirit
Some people have the erroneous concept that they should feel elated after receiving the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
As a rule, if we desire to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we must have the experience of the cross
If we have our own preference and pride, we will use the outpouring of the Holy Spirit to do all kinds of strange things
Whoever receives the outpouring of the Holy Spirit must receive and apply it in a proper way; this requires the experience of the cross
One of the brothers walked on the floor with all four limbs saying that he was the colt on which the Lord Jesus rode on the way to Jerusalem
When we have an adequate amount of experience of the cross, we will no longer need to plead for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
We will not need to pray for the outward filling of the Holy Spirit, but we will have the outward filling of the Holy Spirit
We must have the experience of the cross and then receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit based on this experience
The ultimate purpose of the cross in us is the will of God; it is to rid us of our self and to let God and His will be fulfilled in us
When we are saved, Christ enters into us with the demand of death, requiring us to be freed from the self through His death
Soon after praying such a prayer, the Lord's speaking will come to show that we still have the self in certain aspects
At this time we may still rely on the self, but death continues to kill the particular aspect that the Lord has pointed out
When Paul encountered the great light, all of his being was terminated; his flesh, natural man, and self were not able to rise up
God's shining kills our self; this is the experience of the cross, but there is a difference in degree with different people
When Christ puts the demand of the cross in us, His intention is to terminate us; He requires us to surrender to Him
When we are unwilling to submit to the demand of the cross, God uses the outward environment as a means to help us
It is true that suffering is involved with the cross, but the focus is not on suffering but on death and termination
Although they did not have the Holy Spirit indwelling them prior to this, they had the Holy Spirit upon them as in the Old Testament
In 2 Corinthians 4:10, the 'putting to death,' the killing, the deadening, is the operation of the death of the cross which kills us daily
