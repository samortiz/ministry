   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the highest blessing to inherit the kingdom manifested on earth and even to be kings within it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only the resurrected overcomers, such as the man-child in Revelation 12:5 and the later martyrs in 15:2, but also the raptured living ones, such as the firstfruit in 14:1-5, will have part in this resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not be content merely to be in the general resurrection; rather, we should aspire to be in the first, the best, resurrection.</S>
