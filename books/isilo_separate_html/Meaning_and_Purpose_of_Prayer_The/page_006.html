<p>When we learn the first lesson, we will learn the second lesson spontaneously. When we touch and contact God, He will surely speak, that is, express His mind, within us. When Abraham contacted God, walked with God in sending Him off, and lingered in His presence, God said, &ldquo;Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?&rdquo; (Gen. 18:17). This was God speaking, expressing Himself. Hence, Abraham was able to pray to God according to God&rsquo;s speaking, and Abraham&rsquo;s prayer was God&rsquo;s expression. Every phrase of his prayer was God&rsquo;s expression. At the end of Genesis 18 the Holy Spirit did not say that Jehovah left after Abraham finished praying but that &ldquo;Jehovah went away as soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham&rdquo; (v. 33). This sweet sentence shows that it was Abraham who prayed, but it was Jehovah who spoke. When Jehovah finished speaking, Abraham finished praying. Therefore, Abraham&rsquo;s prayer was the expression of God&rsquo;s speaking. Real prayer is God&rsquo;s expression. If we really contact, touch, and absorb God, He will speak within us. Whenever He speaks, it is time for us to pray. This is how we pray according to His speaking.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that some saints have neither learned to contact God nor to let God speak and express His desire when they pray. There is no need for the elders to pray in tears when the church encounters problems, saying, &ldquo;Lord, look at this problem. Please remember that we are weak and foolish; we do not have much spiritual weight, nor do we know how to administrate the church. Lord, have mercy on us and solve this problem for us.&rdquo; Such desperate prayers cannot be maintained. This is the condition of most prayers: they neither contact nor express God. Some sisters cry in prayer before the Lord whenever their husband has problems, their children are sick, or a family member is in an accident. They utter many words, but it is merely their speaking; they do not give the Lord a chance to speak. Even if the Lord were to say a few words, they would misunderstand His words. Most people pray in this way. Many pray, but few touch the Lord, contact Him, wait before Him, let Him speak, or let Him express Himself. Such prayers in which God does not express Himself are abnormal.</p>
<p>In a normal prayer God speaks to us. Prayer should not be to take care of the problems that are on our heart but to contact God. To pray is to go to God, meet Him, draw near to Him, behold Him, commune with Him, and absorb Him. For example, an elder who is bearing a problem of the church on his heart should touch and absorb God. Instead of mentioning the problem of the church, he should let God speak. God may ask the elder concerning his flesh. The elder has the problem of the church on his heart, but God asks concerning his flesh. Then the elder will immediately sense that he is a fleshly person. God may say, &ldquo;The church has a problem because of your flesh.&rdquo; Then he can confess, &ldquo;Yes, Lord. The problem is not with the church but with me. Lord, have mercy on me; save me.&rdquo; Such a prayer is real. When we touch God and let Him speak, our prayer expresses God.</p>
<p>Here is another example. Suppose that a sister&rsquo;s husband has a problem and that her child was in an accident, but she does not mention these matters to the Lord. Instead, she touches and absorbs Him. When the Lord touches her, He will speak. He might ask concerning her attitude toward her husband and toward her child. Immediately she will have a sense and say, &ldquo;Lord, I have failed my husband and neglected my child because of my disposition and my temper.&rdquo; The Lord may ask whether she has been broken or whether she has learned the lesson. She can then confess, &ldquo;Lord, I have not yet been broken, nor have I learned the lesson. My disposition and my temper have not been dealt with by You.&rdquo; Even though the sister did not pray for her husband or child, God will bless her husband and child. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word that &ldquo;all these things will be added to you&rdquo; (Matt. 6:33). This is genuine and normal prayer.</p>
<p>Our problem is that we often go to God in prayer, but we do not let Him speak to us. We must understand that the best prayer is not one in which we speak to God but one in which God speaks to us. The more we touch God in our prayer, the more He will speak to us. What matters is not how much we speak to God, but how much God speaks to us. What matters is how much we let God appear to us, speak to us, touch us, and point out our inner condition. We should drop all our burdens, forget our requests, and pay attention only to what God is touching in us. Then we should pray only according to that point. Whatever God asks for is what we say. Then our prayer will be His speaking, His expression. The most genuine and valuable prayer is one in which God expresses His prayer through man.</p>
<p>To pray by letting God speak and express Himself is to pray according to the Lord&rsquo;s word in John 15:7. When we abide in the Lord, have fellowship with Him, and let Him speak within us, what we ask will be according to His words. Such prayer is not out of our self, nor is it initiated by us; rather, it is out of the Lord, and He is its source. We are not uttering our own words but the words that the Lord has spoken within us. Such prayer is not the expression of our will but the Lord&rsquo;s will, and it is not our asking apart from the Lord. Such prayer is our praying to the Lord by abiding in Him and being mingled with Him. Such prayer is the issue of our mingling with the Lord. This is the best prayer!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
