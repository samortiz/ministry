[1]  Knowing the Lord s Leading and the Function of Life
[2]  The first four are words of fellowship given to the brothers and sisters in college concerning how to know God s work, how to know the Lord s leading, and how to know the way of the church, as well as certain life matters closely related to young people, such as consecration, the pursuit of education, and service.
[3]  Chapters 5 and 6 are words of fellowship related to the prospect and goal of the work in Southeast Asia and concerning how man is God s bridge and God s channel.
[4]  CHAPTER ONE KNOWING THE WORK OF GOD THE OUTWARD MANIFESTATION
[5]  In this universe and in every age God works according to His intention.
[6]  God s work seems to be different outwardly in every age; actually, it is absolutely the same in principle inwardly.
[7]  The Old Testament age and the New Testament age are absolutely different, and God s work in the two ages is different.
[8]  It is difficult to say what God s way of working in every age is, and it is even more difficult to say what the outward manifestation of His work in man and through man is.
[9]  When God works Himself into us, what we manifest, what we express, is different from individual to individual.
[10]  When God worked Himself into George M ller, what was manifested through him was the establishing of orphanages.
[11]  God s work in each person is manifested in a different way.
[12]  When we say that God s work in recent ages has been to build His church, our understanding may not be precise enough.
[13]  The Bible opens with these words: In the beginning God...
[14]  The old creation was begun by God, and the new creation also was begun by God.
[15]  This will bring in a cycle in which God calls us and shines on us, we obey Him, and then our obedience and response bring in God s greater call and greater shining.
[16]  If a Christian answers right away when God calls and obeys immediately when he has a sense from the Lord, he will have a hole, an opening, through which God can work Himself into him.
[17]  When God desires to give us a revelation, He does it by coming into us, clothing Himself with us, bringing us along, and giving us a certain feeling so that we sense that the revelation is from within us, yet it is of God.
[18]  Question: As we follow the Lord, what great difficulties will we encounter in the way ahead?
[19]  For example, if a young brother marries a sister and later cannot tolerate her, and then he comes to ask what he should do, we can only tell him, Brother, you must meet the Lord in this matter; the Lord is your way.
[20]  CHAPTER THREE SPIRITUAL QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CONCERNING HOW TO KNOW THE WAY OF THE CHURCH
[21]  Question: In recent days many religious activities and even many heretical and confusing things have happened in the church of God.
[22]  If we are clear about this matter, the next matter, which concerns the attitude we should have toward Christians outside our testimony, can be resolved easily.
[23]  He is truly a child of God and our brother, but he is standing on the wrong ground, which we can neither acknowledge nor participate in. If we were to stand on that ground, we would be violating the oneness of the church.
[24]  All those who did not take this way regretted it in the end. Some regretted that they were touched once but did not answer the Lord s call, and others regretted that because they were greedy in the matter of their livelihood, they did not take the Lord s way.
[25]  CONCERNING TAKING THE LORD S WAY HAVING AN ABSOLUTE CONSECRATION
[26]  Question: What is consecration, and what does it mean to take the Lord s way?
[27]  Answer: A believer s genuine consecration is to allow God to come into him and to work in him.
[28]  In order to allow God to work in this way, you must learn to follow the sense in your spirit.
[29]  When you sense in your spirit that God has a demand on you, you must go along with Him.
[30]  When you sense in your spirit that God wants you to get rid of something, you must obey Him.
[31]  Question: What is the difference between our thoughts and God s shining?
[32]  Answer: Many Christians have the question of how to know whether a feeling is given by God or a leading comes from God.
[33]  In other words, how can we clearly tell that a certain leading we have is of God?
[34]  Question: What should I do if I have the heart to serve but am still in school and feel that my studies are a distraction?
[35]  Question: If our consecration is due to the church s arrangement, does this arrangement represent spiritual authority?
[36]  The Lord speaks of not setting the mind on the things of God but on the things of men v. 23 . Then He goes on to say, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself v. 24 . This shows that the self is in the expression of one s opinions, because to not set the mind on the things of God but on the things of men is to express oneself through the opinions in one s mind.
[37]  CHAPTER FIVE THE PROSPECT AND GOAL OF THE WORK
[38]  We should ask the Lord to prepare their hearts and work in their environment so that they can readily receive the Lord s grace and His speaking and at the same time willingly answer His call and meet His need.
[39]  For many years we have had a strong feeling within that in Southeast Asia, including Taiwan, although the Lord s name has been preached for a hundred years and there are many believers among the Chinese, the Lord s work in this region has not had a proper beginning, nor have the Lord s churches been properly established.
[40]  If the Lord is willing to work among us, or perhaps we should say, if we are willing to let Him work among us, there are four matters that we must see and that must have definite results.
[41]  It is not simply a matter of being revived by the Lord through His grace; even more, it is a matter of truly being subdued from within and broken by the Lord.
[42]  In order for the Lord to have a way to advance among us, we must let Him do a thorough work in this matter.
[43]  If there are several thousand or even tens of thousands of believers in Southeast Asia today, yet only a hundred or more of us have received the Lord s mercy to lay everything aside and take the time to sit together before the Lord, opening our hearts, preparing our spirits, looking to Him, and depending on Him to do the work, this will prove and show that we are those whom the Lord desires to use.
[44]  Once we see these four matters, we must have much waiting and prayer before the Lord.
[45]  In our prayers we need not only to pay attention to these four main matters but also to see that within them there are many detailed items.
[46]  First, we must pray that the Lord will raise up people to be workers who will consecrate their time to the Lord, lay aside their careers, abandon their future, and give themselves wholly to Christ.
[47]  Rather, it requires a group of brothers and sisters to see the need, receive the burden, and tell the Lord immediately, Lord, since You have raised up this work and have many brothers and sisters responding by setting aside the world and laying down their future to work solely for You, I must stand up and do business for this need, making money and gaining material possessions to supply the need of Your work.
[48]  However, this absolutely must not be for themselves, for their families, for their children, and certainly not for their own future; rather, it must be for the Lord s work, for men s souls, for the gospel, for the churches, and for the Lord s coming kingdom.
[49]  We look to the Spirit of the Lord to move freely and work particularly so that our meeting will be filled with Him.
[50]  Rather, we are willing to hand everything over to the Holy Spirit, who is among us and is moving in all of us, that we may have the inspiration to pray, to testify, to release the Lord s word, or to admonish.
[51]  However, we also ask the Lord to restrict man s activities so that we can live under the Holy Spirit s authority and give the Holy Spirit absolute freedom.
[52]  Perhaps a brother who is a co-worker will be inspired to testify, release the Lord s word, or give us some fellowship in the matter of following the Lord.
[53]  We do not know what the Lord desires to do or will do in this time of waiting and fellowship, but we are willing to open ourselves unconditionally to the Lord and give Him a free opportunity to do what He desires to do.
[54]  We only desire to come together with the brothers and sisters, looking to the Lord, waiting for the Lord, giving Him the opportunity, and letting Him work so that He may speak freely, take the way He desires to take, and gain what He needs to gain so that His desire may be carried out through us.
[55]  God s eternal plan, which He designed in the beginning, is to be accomplished through man.
[56]  After God created man, He gave His purpose over to man s will for man to choose and to agree with.
[57]  If man agrees a little, God works a little.
[58]  History has proven that the Lord s move advanced and spread any time there was a person, a few persons, or a group of people, regardless of the age, place, or ethnicity, who were gained by the Lord to be of the same mind as the Lord, to move and work with the Lord, and to desire the Lord s purpose and work to be fulfilled.
[59]  Man can either impede, limit, bind, and hinder God, or he can complement God, help Him, move with Him, be of the same mind as He, labor with Him, and be His channel, giving Him a way, even a smooth way.
[60]  Genuine salvation is not only for us to gain a little peace, some blessings, or some benefits; it is not even merely for us to reach a certain condition in the future.
[61]  The highest meaning of salvation is that we become God s counterpart, being of the same mind as He, moving with Him, and becoming His co-workers, even to the extent that we become Him and He becomes us, that is, that He enters into us and we live in Him.
[62]  He is still God, but He has gained man; we are still human, but we have gained God.
[63]  However, if each of us is gained by Him, responding to Him from within as His counterpart, being of the same mind as He, moving with Him, being His co-workers, and being one with Him, then through us He can do what He desires to do and gain what He desires to gain.
[64]  If we listen to messages, attend meetings, pray to the Lord, and read the Word, yet we put God aside, ignore His voice, reject His demands, and cast His word behind us, God will have no way to gain a channel.
[65]  If we remain in ourselves and have no relationship with God, if we belong to Him in name but not in reality and live apart from Him, we will become a hindrance and a limitation to God.
[66]  Yes, who is willing to rise up and answer the Lord s call, placing himself in the Lord s hands thoroughly and completely, without conditions, without reservations, and without choices, desiring only the Lord Himself and rejecting the world, position, and everything that is natural and worldly?
[67]  We look to the Lord to give us this grace that He may walk among us and that we may be shown mercy, so that whomever He goes to, that one will give Him a free way, and whomever He gives a demand to, that one will bow his head and say, Lord, here am I; send me.
[68]  Since this is the case, we need to consider what influence God has on our life and what His relationship is to us in our living.
[69]  Even when we do something good, we are independent from God if what we do is done apart from God, has nothing to do with God, does not have God s promise, and does not have God in it.
[70]  If we do something in this way, no matter how well we handle the matter, God considers it to be a sin because we are independent from Him.
[71]  Without God, we become extreme, leaning too much either to the right or to the left.
[72]  Whenever we allow God to be the center, our person will immediately be balanced.
[73]  We need to worship the Lord for the leading and training He has given us recently.
[74]  In the Old Testament whenever God s people began a move, they first had a corporate consecration.
[75]  The brothers and sisters who attended the recent training, whether they attended the classes formally or audited them, must all have a desperate heart before the Lord to be willing to take the way of serving the Lord and to take this way their entire life.
[76]  If the Lord arranges our circumstances so that we have sufficient means to live without the need to acquire more material things for our enjoyment, we should use all our strength, effort, time, and energy on matters pertaining to the spreading of the Lord s gospel and the building up of the church.
[77]  However, even if the Lord does not make provision for our food, clothing, shelter, and transportation and we therefore need to use our time, energy, and strength to earn money to make a living, our living should still be for and focus on the Lord s gospel and the church.
[78]  After these sixteen weeks of classes I believe that many of you feel that reading the Bible is not simple, speaking for the Lord is not simple, knowing life is not simple, and being a minister of the word for the Lord s use is not simple.
[79]  Even though everything you heard in these sixteen weeks of classes is God s truth, and almost everything you saw is spiritual, you need to realize that what you heard, what you saw, and what you touched in the past sixteen weeks are but a small portion of the spiritual riches of God.
[80]  KEEPING THE ORDER IN THE SERVICE AND COORDINATION OF THE CHURCH
[81]  Furthermore, when we serve in different places, we should not serve in a disorderly and impractical way.
[82]  Wherever the Lord has arranged for us to serve, we should serve singleheartedly, serving the saints and the sinners.
[83]  Likewise, if we are clear inwardly that the Lord wants us to hold a job in order to earn some material riches to support the Lord s work, we should go on faithfully and diligently, doing much business and earning money to care for the Lord s work.
