   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FIFTY-ONE THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN HIS FOUR STAGES ACCORDING TO</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 2 Scripture Reading: Isa 53:10c-11b; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; John 14:17-20; Col 1:18; Rev 1:5a; Gal 6:15; 2 Cor 5:17; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; 1 Pet 1:3; Heb 2:10a, 11b-12; Eph 2:19; Gal 6:10; Eph 1:11; John 12:24; 3:30a; Eph 1:22-23; 1 Cor 10:17; Rev 1:18a; Eph 1:5, 9; Phil 2:13; Rom 4:25b; Col 3:4a, 10-11</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Prayer: Lord, we want You to know that we still need You.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need You as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need You as the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, do speak in our speaking, and do be one spirit with us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, cover us all against all the enemy's attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We hide ourselves in You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We believe that You are here with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are meeting into Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, do honor Your name, and anoint everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Visit everyone, and touch every heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This message is the second in a series of four messages on the all-inclusive Christ in His four stages according to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this message we will consider the stage of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Isaiah 53:10b-11b says, "When He makes Himself an offering for sin, / He will see a seed, He will extend His days, / And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ He will see the issue of the travail of His soul, / And He will be satisfied; / By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this portion of the Word there are four points: 1 Christ's making Himself an offering for sin; 2 His seeing a seed and extending His days; 3 His seeing the issue of the travail of His soul and being satisfied; and 4 His making many righteous by the knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first item of the four belongs to the second stage, the stage of Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The remaining three points belong to the third stage, the stage of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Isaiah 53:11a, the words the issue have been inserted; they are not present in the Hebrew text.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The issue is the outcome, the result, of the travail of Christ's soul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ suffered by pouring out His soul unto death v. 12b . Surely there should be an issue, an outcome, of that travail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Isaiah said that Christ would see the outcome, that is, the issue, of the travail of His soul, and He would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then, Isaiah 53:11b says, "By the knowledge of Him, the righteous One, My Servant, will make the many righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The phrase by the knowledge of Him does not mean by Christ's knowledge; it means by knowing Him, the righteous One, the resurrected Christ as God's Servant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By such knowledge of Him, Christ will make the many righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many versions of the Bible translate this verse, "will justify the many."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Hebrew text can mean both.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But we prefer to translate it, "will make the many righteous," because this refers to Christ in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Justification is related mainly to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, for Christ to make us righteous is not merely to justify us through His death by His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It means primarily to make us righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It must be in resurrection that the living Christ lives in us so that He can be lived out of us as righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, Revelation 19:7-8 says that when the bride is ready for the marriage of the Lamb, she will be clothed in fine linen, which is the righteousnesses of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The righteousnesses of the saints refer to the subjective righteousness lived out of us by our living of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ in His resurrection will make us all righteous by Himself as the resurrection life being lived out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaiah 53:12a says, "Therefore I will divide to Him a portion with the Great, / And He will divide the spoil with the Strong."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This brief portion in Isaiah 53 refers to Christ's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is in His ascension that Christ brought us to the heavens as His captives.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We were Satan's captives, but through His death and resurrection, Christ released us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then, in a sense, He captured us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now we are His captives.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His ascension He brought all of us as His captives with Him into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He was ascending, Ephesians 4:8 says that "He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Amplified New Testament renders this, "He led a train of vanquished foes."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that Christ conquered Satan and captured Satan's captives, making them His captives.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In His ascension Christ brought all these captives to the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There in the heavens He and the Father, who is the great One and also the strong One, shared the prey and divided the spoil.</S>
