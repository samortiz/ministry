The same principle applies to healing. Deliverance is on the same basis. We must know that it is accomplished.</p><p>There was a man who was an elder of a church in a large city. He was very zealous for the Lord. He had three or four big stores. He also supported the pastor in his church and preached with him. Furthermore, this man had a very hot temper! He came to me early one morning with tears in his eyes and said, "I am due to preach in church this morning, but I am afraid I cannot." "What is your trouble?" I asked. He said, "You know I have an awful temper. I realize this, and I hate it. I know that I should not lose my temper. I confess and then lose my temper again. I tell all my employees about the Lord Jesus, and then I lose my temper. They say, `What is the use of being a Christian?' I have lost my temper in all of my stores, so I have lost my testimony too. Yesterday, I was very annoyed with some of my employees. I managed to control myself even though I was very irritated. I thought, `It is my turn to preach tomorrow, I dare not let my temper flare,' so I kept it under control until I got home. I was shaking all over with suppressed wrath. Then I was irritated by happenings at home, but again I thought, `It is my turn to preach tomorrow so I dare not flare up.' So I kept it all under control. This morning when I got up, I recalled what had happened yesterday and shook all over at my remembrance of it. Then my daughter did something to upset me. Then, to aggravate matters, my wife burned the food. After all that I said, `This is beyond endurance; even if it is my turn to preach, I cannot keep this under control any longer. I cannot control myself, and I just cannot preach because I am about to burst!' Now what about this?" I smiled, and he said, "Do not make fun of me." I said, "I feel very happy." "Why?" "I am rejoicing in another great case for the Lord," I said. "Do not think that my case is easy; my temper is beyond my control," he replied. I said, "It may be too much for you, but it is not too much for the Lord. I believe in practical salvation, not in theoretical salvation." Then I turned to Romans 8:2 and read, "The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." I asked him, "Are you in Christ Jesus?" "Certainly I am," he replied. "All right, then what does the Word of God say?" "The law of the Spirit...has freed me." I asked him, "What tense is used?" "Past!" he exclaimed. "Yes, God says that the law of the Spirit of life has already made you free. Are you free?" "Of course not," he replied. Then I said, "I did not ask you whether or not you have lost your temper today. I am asking whether or not you are free. According to the Word of God you are free because it says, `has freed me.'" He replied, "According to Romans 8:2 I am free, but according to my experience I am not free." Then I asked, "Are you going to believe in your experience or in God's Word? Which is more reliable, God's Word or your experience?" He answered, "Of course, as a Christian I must say God's Word, but I cannot say that I am free." I said, "God does not so mind your temper as much as He minds your evil heart of unbelief. God's Word says, `The law of the Spirit of life has freed me.' When you say that the Spirit has not freed you, you are saying that God's word in Romans 8:2 is not true. I do not mind your bad temper as much as I mind your evil heart of unbelief." He said with tears, "I am convicted of unbelief, because I am hoping that I will be free but cannot believe that I am free. I cannot believe the Word of God that I am already free." I said, "This Sunday morning I have to speak; I must go and prepare. I am sorry that I cannot stay any longer, but I can let you have my sitting room. You should deal with God about this sin of unbelief." I came back a half hour later. The brother gripped my hand and said, "Praise the Lord, hallelujah." "What has happened?" I asked. He responded, "Praise the Lord, I am free!" I asked, "What about your temper?" "I only know this, I am free. I care about nothing else because I am free," he replied. Then I asked, "Are you going to be free, or are you free now?" "I am free now," was his reply. As he went out the door, he said, "Praise the Lord, I am free." Two months later I met him and asked, "How are you now?" His answer was simply, "Praise the Lord, I am free." Four months later I met him again and asked the same question. He still answered, "Praise the Lord, I am free." After six months he still had the same answer to my question. This is faith. Faith is not, "I will be free" or "God is able to make me free." Faith is standing on the Word of God and saying, "I am free."</p><p>How can we have faith? We must have our eyes opened. This is the most important point in regard to faith. We cannot just sit down and say, "I am saved; therefore, I am saved" or "I am healed; therefore, I am healed" or "I am free; therefore, I am free." This is auto-suggestion, not faith. Instead, we need our eyes to be opened; we need revelation from the Word of God so that we can say, "God has heard my prayer, I know it!" We may not understand, but we know. We may not be able to explain whether we heard a voice or saw a vision, etc., but we just know. How do we know? We know; that is all. How do we know our name? We just know it. We do not need to go to a registry office to verify it or look in our passport once in a while to make sure. We know. Someone may say, "The Word of God says so." This is all right, but it may mean nothing. Yes, the Word of God says so, but do we know it? If we reason, "Since I have had a revelation, I have faith," and ask, "What should I do next?", then we have no faith! Faith is spontaneous. Faith is: "Lord, I praise Your name; it is done." Praise is the natural outcome of faith, the spontaneous result of faith. We do not have to work it up. Whenever there is faith, God honors it; whenever there is faith, there will be praise and prayer will cease. We will say, "Thank You," and we will not plead. No one will need to urge us to praise because we cannot help but do so. May God teach us the true nature of faith. All prayer is heard on this basis.
