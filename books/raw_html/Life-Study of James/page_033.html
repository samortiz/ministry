<h2 class="head1">A MAXIM</h2><p>Many Christians treasure 4:13-17, especially James&rsquo; word in verses 14 and 15. In verse 14 James says, &ldquo;You are a vapor, appearing for a little while, and then disappearing.&rdquo; This statement may be considered a proverb. Then in verse 15 James encourages us to say, &ldquo;If the Lord wills, we will both live and do this or that.&rdquo; Here James is saying that instead of declaring that today or tomorrow we will go to a certain place, spend time there, do business, and make a profit, we should simply say, &ldquo;If the Lord wills....&rdquo;</p><p>The word of James in verse 15 sounds very much like a maxim. When I was young, I had the thought of making a sign with this maxim on it to remind me always to say, &ldquo;If the Lord wills.&rdquo; Although I still appreciate this saying, I can recognize that it has an Old Testament tone.</p><p>Christians sometimes use this verse in writing letters, saying that they will go to a certain place or do a particular thing &ldquo;if the Lord wills.&rdquo; I know from experience that this clause can be a protection to us. For example, I may be invited to a certain place and accept the invitation. But in my letter of acceptance I may add the clause &ldquo;if the Lord wills.&rdquo; This protects me in the sense that if eventually I am not able to go to there as planned, I cannot be condemned by others for not coming. Therefore, to say &ldquo;If the Lord wills&rdquo; can be a protection.</p><h2 class="head1">LED BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>What James says in these verses is different in tone from what is found elsewhere in the New Testament, especially in the writings of Paul. Perhaps you can think of certain verses written by Paul that are similar to James&rsquo; word in 4:15. Nevertheless, the basic tone of Paul&rsquo;s writing is different, for he charges us to walk according to the Spirit. For example, in Galatians 5:16 Paul says, &ldquo;But I say, walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&rdquo; Then in Galatians 5:25 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&rdquo; Furthermore, in Romans 8:4 Paul tells us that &ldquo;the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&rdquo;</p><p>In the book of Acts we see that Paul was led by the Spirit and walked in spirit. Acts 16:6 says that they were &ldquo;forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia.&rdquo; Then verse 7 says that the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go into Bithynia. Here we see that when Paul was traveling for the preaching of the gospel, he was restrained and directed by the Spirit. On other occasions Paul was stirred in his spirit (Acts 17:16), was pressed in the spirit (Acts 18:5), and purposed in spirit (Acts 19:21).</p><p>To say, &ldquo;If the Lord wills,&rdquo; is rather objective and is quite much according to the tone of the Old Testament. But to be led of the Spirit, to walk in the Spirit, and to do what our spirit constrains us to do are subjective and are much more according to the New Testament.</p><p>I certainly have no intention of belittling James or his Epistle. However, I must truthfully point out that after many years studying this book, I have learned that this Epistle is very Jewish and has a strong color, tone, taste, and atmosphere of the Old Testament. If we did not have the fourteen Epistles of Paul, we might be influenced by the book of James to go back to Judaism. Although we appreciate and need James&rsquo; emphasis on practical Christian perfection, we still need to be very clear that much of his Epistle has the tone, color, and atmosphere of the Old Testament.</p>
