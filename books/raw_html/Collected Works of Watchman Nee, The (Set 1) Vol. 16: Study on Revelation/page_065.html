<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>P. Revelation 17:16</H2><P>"And the ten horns which you saw and the beast, these will hate the harlot and will make her desolate and naked and will eat her flesh and burn her utterly with fire." </P><P>The ten horns and the beast hate the harlot. They do not hate the woman, because the woman, the city of Rome (17:18), is their kingdom. They hate the harlot because, in name, the harlot still belongs to Christ.</P><P>In this book the beast refers, on the one hand, to Rome and, on the other hand, to Antichrist. In 17:16 it refers to Antichrist. We know now that Antichrist is the resurrected Nero. When Nero was on earth, he persecuted the Christians severely. After he resurrects, how could he allow Rome to belong to Christ? Hence, the first thing he will do is destroy the great harlot. He hates the harlot for two reasons:</P><P>(1) The conduct of the harlot is too evil. Although the consciences of the worldly people have not yet been enlightened by God, they cannot tolerate the conduct of the Roman Church. This conduct includes: (a)teaching that the bread becomes Christ's actual body after the priest's blessing, (b)restricting the reading of the Bible to the priests only, (c)the practice of confessing to the priests, (d)the inquisition, (e)sending heretics to the civil government, (f)selling indulgences, and so forth. Therefore, even the heathen despise her vulgarness, wickedness, and greed.</P><P>(2) The harlot is hated also for her good. There is much truth in the Roman Church, such as God being triune and Jesus being the Son of God, born of Mary. Furthermore, the Roman Church recognizes the Lord's death, resurrection, and ascension. It still belongs to Christ in name. This is why it is hated.</P><P>The ways in which the ten horns and the beast deal with the harlot are:</P><P>(1) "Make her desolate." This may mean that the Vatican where the Pope resides will become a desolate place.</P><P>(2) "Make her...naked." If interpreted literally, this would mean material loss. If interpreted spiritually, this may mean the exposing of her secrets.</P><P>(3) "Will eat her flesh." If interpreted literally, this would mean to eat her flesh. If interpreted spiritually, this may mean the slaying of her prominent figures or of the Catholics.</P><P>(4) "Burn her utterly with fire." The literal interpretation should not be hard to understand.</P><P>"The kings of the earth" are her good friends. Yet when they see her suffering, they only weep and lament over her; they do not help her (Rev. 18:9-10). The seventh king is also her friend; however, he is only a friend temporarily and cannot help her either. Antichrist becomes her archenemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Q. Revelation 17:17</H2><P>"For God has put it into their hearts to perform His mind and to perform one mind and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God are accomplished." </P><P>Probably this will happen after the harlot is removed. That may be the time for the kingdom of Antichrist to come.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>R. Revelation 17:18</H2><P>"And the woman whom you saw is the great city, which has a kingdom over the kings of the earth." </P><P>The woman here refers to Rome because, at the time of John, only Rome had a kingdom over the kings of the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE MATERIAL (POLITICAL) BABYLON<br>(REVELATION 18:1-24)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 18:1</H2><P>"After these things I saw another Angel coming down out of heaven, having great authority; and the earth was illumined with His glory." </P><P>This is Christ Himself. Besides Him, no one else could have such authority or illumine the earth with his glory.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 18:2</H2><P>"And He cried with a strong voice, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the Great! And she has become a dwelling place of demons and a hold of every unclean spirit and a hold of every unclean and hateful bird."</P><P>God destroyed the religious part of Rome by the beast and the ten horns (17:16). Now, He Himself will come to destroy the city of Rome; hence, there is such a great proclamation. This was prophesied in the Old Testament. (The word "satyrs" in Isaiah 13:21 (KJV) was translated "devils" in the Septuagint. Although Isaiah 34:13-15 speaks of the conditions in the land of Idumea, it is very similar to what is described in Revelation 18:2.)</P>
