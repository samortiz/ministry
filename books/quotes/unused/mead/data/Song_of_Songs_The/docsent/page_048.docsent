   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Wounded 5:7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 7 says, "The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This time she does not go out to look for the watchmen, and she does not ask them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rather, they meet her.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They wonder how a person as beautiful as she, who has gone through as much change as she, would lose her beloved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They may try to help her, but their words only serve to hurt her more and increase her pain.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She yearns for consolation, but she receives only wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis quoted a good verse regarding this portion: "For they persecute him whom You have stricken,/And they recount the pain of those whom You have wounded" Psa 69:26 . They do not know how to take care of her problems.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They think that she must be wrong if the Lord has withdrawn.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They do not realize that she has suffered enough blows already; they think that their rebukes can help her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They give her more blows through their words.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At this time, she cannot help but proclaim, "Reproach has broken my heart, /And I am sick;/I looked for pity, but there was none; /And for comforters, but I found none" v. 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Her pain does not stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only are the others not able to help her or comfort her; they joke about her condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who are responsible to keep watch over her do not cover her; rather, they publicize her affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, she loses her veil, and she is without any covering; her shame is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Her failure becomes public news among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She is indeed like Job, who tried to find a friend who would help him, but ended up with those who condemned him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These keepers are the ones who take responsibility in the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spiritually speaking, they ought to be her guides.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But often even the discernment of a spiritual person can be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our brothers' attitudes toward us may be wrong many times, but this is something under the Lord's permission; the purpose of it is for us to become conscious of our own failures.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we go on with the Lord according to His will, He will have a way to deal with our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we fail, however small this failure may be, the Lord will allow our brothers to deal with us more severely than He Himself will deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>F. Seeking Help</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>from the Daughters of Jerusalem 5:8</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 8 says, "I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the maiden cannot find help from spiritual men, she seeks help among those who are less advanced than she is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When she feels that she has offended the Lord and has lost His countenance, in her desperation she tries to find help even from the daughters of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Her words amount to an admission of her failure and that, if possible, they should pray for her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Her sense of failure is so deep that she feels that even babes in the Lord can render her some help.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She is not ignorant of their immaturity, and she realizes that their fellowship with the Lord is not perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why she says, "If ye find my beloved."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>She knows that they may not find Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet in her deep remorse and helplessness, she hopes to find one or two persons who can render some help.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Her own prayers seem to go unanswered, and she now turns to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She wants to convey the message, "I am sick of love."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She used this expression once before, but her condition was different than it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She had been in the midst of an intimate tide of fellowship, but now she is in a time of dryness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is not surprising for a person to speak such a word at a time when feelings run high.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when darkness is all around and there are contrary feelings, it is not easy to speak such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This proves that she has made a considerable advance in the life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>She has learned to take control of her environment, and she can control her own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This love sickness does not arise from an overindulgence in love, but from a hunger for love.</S>
