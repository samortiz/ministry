If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
In other words, the first section covers a specific case, while the second section covers a general principle, a great principle
In verses 15-17, the Lord Jesus tells us what should be done when a brother has sinned against another brother
He meant that one should act in this way because these are crucial matters and because this is an important principle
We have to see that we should not only handle a brother's offenses against us in this way but also thousands of other things
Everything, whether it is something to be bound or loosed, should have its binding or its loosing originate from the earth
When Moses was on the mountain, the Israelites won every time he raised his hands, and the Amalekites won every time he lowered his hands
Truly, God in heaven wanted the Israelites to win, but if Moses had not raised his hands on earth, the Israelites would have lost
God has a purpose to increase the number of the house of Israel so that the Israelites would increase like a flock
Those who do not know God will say, 'If God wants to increase the number of the Israelites like a flock, He could go ahead and do it
Heaven may want to accomplish something, but heaven will not do it alone; heaven waits for the earth to do it first, and then heaven does it
The man He created was not like a piece of stone or wood; he was not a table or a chair which could be placed here or there by God at will
Even though it is obedient, you are still not satisfied, because it does not have a free will; it is completely passive
That will be the time for God's eternal will to be fulfilled and for man's free will to become harmonious with God's eternal will
All His works on earth can be accomplished only when there is a will on earth that agrees with and decides to do the works
A prayer which is in the nature of work or ministry is one in which you stand on God's side, wanting what God wants
Whatever the church binds on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever the church looses on earth will be loosed in heaven
The amount of power that the church has expresses the amount of power that God has because His power is expressed through the church
If the power of the church is small and restricted, God cannot express the height or extensiveness of His power
The water department's reservoir may be great, but if you have only a small tap in your house, a great amount of water will not flow out
If the tap is small, the amount of water flowing through the tap will not be great, even if there is as much water as the Yangtze River
There are many things that God wants to bind in heaven, and there are many things that God wants to loose in heaven
The question is whether or not there are men on earth to bind what God wants to bind and loose what God wants to loose
We cannot ask God to do something that He is not willing to do, yet we can stop Him from doing something He wants to do
We have seen that Matthew 18:15-17 speaks of a particular case and that the great principle is given in the following verses
If the church considers a brother a Gentile and a tax collector, God in heaven will consider the same brother a Gentile and a tax collector
If God's demand is rejected in the church, God will not be able to accomplish what He wants to accomplish in heaven
When the church prays, it is like turning on the tap; the more the tap is turned, the less the pressure becomes
Brothers and sisters, if you feel heavy and pressed within, you have not fulfilled your ministry before God; God's pressure is upon you
The Lord's intention is not to tell men to pray for a certain matter in harmony, but to be in harmony concerning any matter
If we are in harmony concerning any matter, then our Father in heaven will accomplish whatever we ask concerning a particular matter
If you are not in the oneness of the Holy Spirit and not praying in the harmony of the Holy Spirit, do you think heaven will listen to you?
Brothers and sisters, do not think that as long as you agree in your opinions that your prayers will be answered
Perhaps two people are trying to help others, but while they are helping others, they have friction between themselves
When our natural life is dealt with by the Lord and we are brought to the point where we truly know the Body of Christ we will be in harmony
When you are about to pray for certain things and you hold a different view you have to be careful you may make mistakes
If the whole church gathers together and is in harmony concerning a certain matter, that matter must be what heaven intends to accomplish
Before they have the same view, they must first be in harmony concerning any matter and must have prayed concerning a certain matter
We must remember that the prayer in Matthew 18 can never be covered by prayers that are in the nature of spiritual edification
The ministry of the church is the ministry of the Body of Christ, and the ministry of the Body of Christ is prayer
If the church takes up this responsibility to pray, it will see that from that day forward his life and spiritual walk will dry up
God cannot resolve them because the church has not exercised its free will to stand on God's side and fulfill God's goal
Brothers and sisters, you have to remember that the highest and greatest work of the church is to be the outlet of God's will
When John 15:16 records, 'Whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you,' the number of people is not a condition
There is only one goal with them, which is to tell God, 'We want Your will to be done, in heaven and on earth'
When the church prays in this position, whatever it asks will be done for it from the Father who is in the heavens
If we see the churchs responsibility of prayer we will see that our prayers are not big enough we are limiting God and frustrating His work
Brothers and sisters, we have to cry out loudly that God is watching to see whether the church is faithful to its ministry
We should not be afraid that the capacity on earth is too large, because the capacity in heaven is always larger
Heaven always wants to bind more than the earth binds, and heaven always wants to loose more than the earth looses
Many people come to the meeting for the sake of observing or spectating; this will surely not result in anything
For others, the Lord is speaking within them, telling them that if they do not come that day, they will miss something
Those whom the Lord has gathered this way are gathered together into the Lord's name; they come for the sake of the Lord's name
Whenever these brothers and sisters come together, they can say, 'I am here for the Lord's name and for glorifying the Son
When all the brothers and sisters are gathered together for the Lord's name's sake, there will be oneness and harmony
Our hearts have to be turned toward His name and desire that His name be exalted above every name and that every idol be cast down
If the church is normal, at the end of every meeting, the church will know whether the Lord has been in its midst
In praying do not babble empty words as the Gentiles do; for they suppose that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard
They do this in order to be seen by others, because synagogues and street corners are public places, places that men pass by all the time
Although you do not feel anything outwardly, you have to believe that you are praying to the Father who is in secret!
The expression 'multiplicity of words' in Greek is used to describe the monotonous and repetitious sound that a stammering person makes
It is like standing on a pebbled street and listening to the repetitious and monotonous sound of wheels rolling across pebbles
Many prayers are offered as a result of man's influence, and many words are uttered which are beyond one's desires
These prayers are like the sound of a stream tumbling against the rocks; they are also like the sound of wheels rolling over pebbles
The purpose of our prayer is not to inform God of something but to show Him our trust, our faith, our dependence, and our wish
In other words, the Lord was teaching us how to pray; He was not teaching us to imitate His words, but to pray in His way
Thank God that His Son has died and risen for us so that we can become God's children and receive a new position
May the Spirit of the Lord teach us more and more to know that God is our Father and to believe that the Father is loving and patient
God's name is used in the Bible to designate His revelation to man concerning Himself; it denotes everything we know about Him
Brothers and sisters, we have to remember that the main thing and the ultimate goal in our prayer is for God to gain glory
The house of Israel had not sanctified God's name, so God's name was profaned wherever they went among the heathens
Brothers and sisters, if you are filled with a historical concept of the kingdom, you have seen only one side of the truth and not all sides
When the Lord Jesus came, we had the declaration of John the Baptist, who proclaimed that the kingdom of the heavens had drawn near
In asking us to pray for His kingdom to come, the Lord is looking forward to the time when God's kingdom will fill the whole earth
In order to bring in God's kingdom, the church has to pay the price to be restricted by heaven and come under heaven's rule
At the same time, we should say to Satan, 'Depart from the earth immediately, and go to the eternal fire which God has prepared for you'
Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that it is wonderful that such a thing as prayer can exist in the Bible
Prayer means that God wants to do something, yet He will not do it Himself; He will wait for man on earth to pray about it before He does it
The reason that we need to pray is because God will not do anything by Himself; He has to wait for man to pray before He works
The Holy Spirit was to descend, but it could not descend until the hundred and twenty people prayed for ten days
It is first for God to have a will, second for us to touch this will and pray for it, and third for God to answer our prayer when we pray
Many people have the wrong concept that the reason man prays to God is to initiate something and ask God to do something
We have to ask God to open our eyes so that we can see that the move in heaven is affected by our prayer on earth
When some read this, they do not understand why the Lord turns suddenly from God's name, His kingdom, and His will to our daily bread
When a true man of God prays continuously for His name, kingdom, and will, the Lord takes care of the man himself
Brothers and sisters, if we have a strong desire to be for His name, His kingdom, and His will, we will suffer great hardships
Many brothers and sisters have the experience that as soon as their conscience has a leakage their faith is gone
Concerning faith and a good conscience, Paul said that 'some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith'
If a person is mean toward other brothers and sisters and does not forget their offenses against him, he cannot ask God to forgive his debts
A narrowminded person who always pays attention to how others have offended hurt or illtreated him cannot pray such a prayer before God
A man must have a forgiving heart before he can boldly ask the Father: 'Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors'
Brothers and sisters, just as our offenses before God must be forgiven, so we also must forgive the offenses of others against us
We must first forgive the debts of others before we can pray boldly to the Father Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors
At the same time, if a brother or sister owes you anything and you do not forget it, you are not forgiving their debts
On the other hand, our conscience needs to be clean and void of offense before God; we need God to forgive our debts
Brothers and sisters, the more we take the way of the kingdom of the heavens, the greater the temptations will be
If we do not pray this way, we will not be able to withstand temptation for a moment; we will not be able to accomplish anything
We have to pray for God to protect us so that our daily bread is provided our conscience is clean and we do not face temptation
Not only do we have to ask God not to bring us into temptation, but we also have to ask Him to 'deliver us from the evil one'
They are hidden behind the fever which comes suddenly upon a person's body and the storm which rises suddenly from the sea
The three desires concerning God are basic prayers, and the three requests for ourselves are protective prayers
We ask the Lord to deliver us from the evil one not only because we want to be delivered from the harm of the evil one
Lastly, the Lord taught us to give praise for three things: 'For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever
The Lord wants us to know that with the kingdom, there is authority, and behind the authority, the power to rule
The kingdom denotes the rule of heaven and the authority of God, while the power tells us that all power is in the Holy Spirit
Concerning God, we desire that His name be sanctified, His kingdom come, and His will be done on earth as in heaven
Since the kingdom, the power, and the glory are His, we pray to Him concerning our daily bread, our debt, our temptation, and the evil one
Some have said that this prayer is not for Christians because it does not end with the words 'in the name of the Lord'
When the disciples were on the boat and they cried Lord save us we are perishing did they end with the words in the name of the Lord
If we forgive others with our mouth but do not forgive in our heart, it is not considered as forgiveness in the Father's eyes
If Christians are irreconcilable and if they do not forgive others from their heart, the church will run into problems
The Lord knows that the more we communicate and fellowship with one another, the more we need to forgive one another
No one who is unforgiving can be in the work of the kingdom, and no one who is unforgiving can be a person in the kingdom
The Lord shows us that there is reward for prayer because prayer is too great an issue; it is too great a matter
Man often hears and reads this expression repeatedly to the point that he does not know what it means to be in the name of Jesus Christ
In the New Testament, not only do we see the name of Jesus; we also see one very peculiar expression: 'in the name of Jesus'
Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that this is the greatest thing committed to us from God and the Lord Jesus
When he goes to the bank, writes ten dollars on a check, and puts the seal on the check, he will receive ten dollars
If you commit your name to someone and he uses your name, you have to bear the responsibility of his use of your name
All you have to do is be responsible for what you do personally; you do not have to take responsibility for what others do
Today He has ascended to the heavens and is sitting on the right hand of the Father, waiting for the enemy to be His footstool
When the archangel Michael argued with the devil over the body of Moses, did he say, 'I rebuke you' or 'May the Lord rebuke you'?
Being in the name of the Lord Jesus does not necessarily mean saying the words 'in the name of the Lord Jesus'
Brothers and sisters, do you realize that here is a name, an authority, and a power that have been placed in the hand of the church?
If we did not have this name or did not know how to use this name, there would be no way for us to accomplish these things
God wants the things that pass through the cross and remain, the things that are not destroyed after death has done its work
Only those who stand on such a ground can exercise the Lord's authority, and only they can use the Lord's name
God assumes responsibility for those who stand on this ground, and He is behind them when they use the Lord's name
Luke 24:47 says, 'And that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem'
Acts 1043 says To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins
The apostles did not feel that the Lord's name remained with the Lord and that they had to ask for permission to do anything
If we are standing on the ground of baptism and we have the vision and revelation we will realize that we are in charge of the Lords name
The Lord Jesus said, 'I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy'
Suppose you send a letter to a friend through a messenger, asking your friend to return a sum of money through the same messenger
To stand before God in the name of the Lord Jesus is to say that you do not stand on your own merit but on the merit of the Lord's name
It is to say that you are not counting on what you are or what you will be, but on what the name of the Lord is
It is not because of our righteousness but because of His blood; it is not based on what we want but on what He wants
Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven'
Death and resurrection are for redemption, while ascension is for warfare; it is to execute what death and resurrection have accomplished
Just as the Lord transcended over all spiritual enemies, the church has also transcended over all spiritual enemies
The meaning of the word amen is not 'so be it' or 'may it be so,' but 'it will be so' and 'it will surely come to pass'
Since the Lord was afraid that we would not consider this to be a prayer, He pointed out in the following verse that it is a prayer
Rather, it exercises God's authority and applies this authority to deal with problems and things that ought to be removed
There is a great difference between asking God to remove the mountain and commanding the mountain to be removed
It is by the church having full faith, being without doubt and being clear that what we do is fully according to God's will
In order to not have any doubt about its accomplishment, we must first have no doubt concerning it being God's will
We must see that Christ's ascension has made Him far above all things, and we must see that all things are under His feet
Sometimes he steals man's word, turning it into a different kind of thought and injecting it into another person's mind
In our meeting prayer or conversation we must first pray Lord chase away all the evil spirits and do not allow them to do anything here
Some brothers speak inappropriate words, but we also have to bind those who quote inappropriate verses and call inappropriate hymns
Sometimes people disrupt the peace of the meeting; they may disrupt it through their speaking, crying, or movement in and out of the meeting
Many times, we do not have to say anything; all we have to do is to go to the throne and let the throne take control of them
In many places the truth cannot break through, and in many places it is impossible for men to receive the truth
To pray with authority is for heaven to rule on the earth; it is for the earth to exercise the heavenly authority
We have His life, and we have been transferred from the kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of the Son of His love
The brother commanded the demon with authority, saying, 'I command you in the name of Jesus not to undress yourself'
A poisonous snake could not hurt the hand of God's faithful servant Paul , yet worms could kill the proud Herod
Brothers and sisters, if we submit to God's authority, the demons will be afraid of us and submit to our authority
Brothers and sisters, if we seek after God but do not deny our self, we do not have faith, and we do not have authority
If we seek after God and deny our self, immediately we will have faith and authority and be able to utter prayers of faith and authority
Satan's strategy is to put everything related to the Lord before prayer and make prayer the least important matter
Many people are enthusiastic about attending preaching meetings, Bible study meetings, and other meetings of the church
One brother who had a deep knowledge of the Lord once said, 'We have all committed the sin of negligence to prayer
At the same time, we have to realize that if we had not been so deceived by Satan, we would not have been so negligent concerning prayer
He knows that unless spiritual work is built on a foundation of prayer it will not have much value and its eventual result will be failure
We are busy in the morning and busy in the evening to the extent that prayer is pushed into a corner, and we do not have much time to pray
Of course, in fighting for a time of prayer, there may be some dispute concerning our responsibility, duty, and obligations
Some may think that by devoting ourselves to prayer we may neglect our obligations, give up our duty, and damage or hurt our responsibility
We have to stand strongly, powerfully, and firmly upon our position in Christ and should pray according to the victory of the cross
We must remove all the hindrances in the battleground of prayer by the Lord's name and according to the victory of His cross
Our minds may be very clear and our thoughts uncluttered before we pray, but as soon as we kneel down to pray, our thoughts become confused
We begin to remember things that we do not need to remember and we begin to think of things that we do not need to think about ahead of time
We may want to discharge a burden through prayer, but when we kneel down to pray we cannot offer a single word
If we do not realize that this is Satans deception to destroy our prayer we will want to stop praying and stand up soon after we kneel down
In order to pray, to pray thoroughly and release our burden through prayer, we have to be watchful in our prayer
We cannot glide comfortably into this prayer life, and we cannot follow our imagination to drift into this prayer life
It may seem that we are praying out of habit, but actually within these prayers there are suggestions, instigations, and deceptions of Satan
Brothers and sisters, when we kneel down to pray, if we do not know what we want, how can we expect God to answer our prayer?
Sometimes in our desire we have something we want, but the more we speak the further away we seem to be from our desire
Satan will often accuse us after we fail a little and cause us to analyze ourselves while we pray so that we cannot open our mouth to God
Brothers and sisters, if our prayer is to be according to God's will, we have to persist in our prayer until the end
Even when we fail, we can come before God through the blood of the Lamb; there is no need for Satan to interfere with us
If we are watchful, we will find that many unnecessary, inaccurate words and things are deceptions from the enemy
Our answer to Satan's threat is: 'There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart
We must also be watchful in our prayer so that we do not fall under Satan's deception of not making our prayer specific
If we are watchful, we will find that many cases of forgetfulness, oversight, procrastination, and carelessness did not happen intentionally
Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that a hasty, 'economical' prayer is often a careless prayer that will give ground to Satan
We must not let go, and we must ask the Lord to remind us of all the burdens in our prayer and give us the utterance to pray them
When it became day, He called His disciples to Him, and He chose from them twelve, whom He also named apostles'
If we have spiritual insight, we will see that the work of the devil is present, and we will cast out all the demons behind these things
Otherwise, the difficulty will be like a mountain; either we have to command it to move to the sea, or we have to walk around it
Not only do we have to be watchful before we pray and while we pray, we also have to be watchful after we pray
We must realize that all serious prayers and prayers with burden are made not only 'by means of all prayer' but also 'at every time'
Perhaps, after some time, he will soften, and you can then change to another kind of prayer to cast another net
We have to watch and pray, and we must practice conscientiously, so that Satan will not have the opportunity to destroy our prayer
