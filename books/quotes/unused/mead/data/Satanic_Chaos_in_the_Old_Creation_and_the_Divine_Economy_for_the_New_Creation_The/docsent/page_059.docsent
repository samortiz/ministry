   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>of the Universal Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We meet on the ground of the church as the local expression of the universal Body of Christ.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truth is the Triune God, taking Christ as His center and His circumference so that the church as the Body of Christ, as the organism of the Triune God, can be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The church is the pillar to support such a truth and the base to hold such a truth.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the divine revelation, the truth is the Triune God, taking Christ the Son as the embodiment and as the centrality and universality of His divine economy to have a church to express Him as His organism.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First Timothy 3:15-16a says, "But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
