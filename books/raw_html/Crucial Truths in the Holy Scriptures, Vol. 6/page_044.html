<p>After studying the topics of death and resurrection, we need to consider the topic of judgment. Sin gives birth to death, and death brings in judgment. These topics are interrelated, so we must consider them together.</p>
<p>Judgment is a matter of God&rsquo;s administration. The Bible shows that God executes His judgment according to His righteousness, by His holiness, and for His glory. His judgment is the execution of His government in the universe. The Epistles of Peter speak of God&rsquo;s government and God&rsquo;s kingdom, so they especially speak of God&rsquo;s judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment is an important part of His rule and government. The fact that He judges the devil, the people of the world, and the angels shows that He is the sovereign Lord of the universe with the authority to rule. Without His ruling, there would be no government. God is the Ruler of the universe, so the universe has a government. Since there is a government, there is also judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment is a part of the exercise of His government.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on God&rsquo;s judgment of man. When some look at this matter in a general way, they think that God&rsquo;s judgment concerns only the matter of whether a man will go to heaven or hell. But if we carefully examine what God reveals in the Bible, we will see that this is not the case. The Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s judgment on man that is very particular and that has many distinctions. There are at least six kinds of judgment. Thus, we must spend some time to study God&rsquo;s judgments carefully. This also will help us to understand the Bible and its prophecies.</p>
<p>We will look at the six judgments of God on man according to six different aspects: (1) the time of judgment, (2) the place of judgment, (3) the one who is judging, (4) the ones being judged, (5) the basis for judgment, and (6) the result of judgment. If we clearly see these six aspects with respect to each type of judgment, we will fully understand each of the judgments of God on man.
