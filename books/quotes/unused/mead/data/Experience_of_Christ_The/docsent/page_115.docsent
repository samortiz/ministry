   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In doctrine we may be very clear about this, but we may not practice it in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am not concerned for doctrine, but for your living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In your daily life do you live the life that Christ is living within you?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps as you get up in the morning, you want to talk, but He does not.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In such a case there is a discrepancy between your living and His.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Normally, your living and His living should be one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But instead of this, in your talking too often there are two persons with two different livings instead of two persons with one living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, as you are about to talk about a certain brother, the Lord, who does not want to talk, moves within you to give you a certain feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You sense something moving within.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, many times you do not care for this inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, although the Lord does not want to talk, you proceed to talk anyway, sometimes gossiping for more than an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All this talk is disobedient to God's inner working.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When you gossip in this way, you are not obeying the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem here is that in our talking we very often get off the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Christ was on the cross, He was tempted to prove that He was the Son of God by coming down from the cross Matt 27:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the Lord did not come down from the cross, we do so very often, even many times in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I must confess that this has been my own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am familiar with this illness because I have suffered from it myself for years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, I can illustrate this according to my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Early in the morning, I may talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Unable to eat breakfast in a good way because I am condemned for this, I go to my room and confess to the Lord, saying, "Lord, I confess how natural I am.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Please forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hate my natural man and my talkativeness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, put my tongue on the cross."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every kind of repentance and confession is a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After being killed in this way, I am on the cross again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But later in the day some brothers may come to visit me, and again I may find myself talking too much.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although something within tells me to be quiet, I keep talking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems that there are no brakes on my spiritual car.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Later, I regret my talkativeness and confess to the Lord once again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This time it is difficult even to speak to the Lord, because I feel so ashamed in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, I ask Him to forgive me once again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through my confession, I get on the cross once again.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe that this is not only my experience, but also yours.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The problem is that we get off the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yes, it is a fact that we have been crucified with Christ, but are we on the cross right now?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The secret of taking care of the inner anointing is to stay on the cross.</S>
