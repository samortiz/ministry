   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WILDERNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By the time the seeking one comes out of the wilderness, she has lost her personality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The wilderness, according to my experience, is just our will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To come out of the wilderness is to come out of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The wilderness is really the willderness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as we are remaining in our will, we are wandering in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We could never take a straight path to follow the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our will becomes a deception to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thus, when the seeking one comes out of the wilderness, she comes out of her will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>She was like a horse, a lily, and a dove; but now such a strong-willed person has become the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Who is this that comes out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The answer is that this is Solomon's couch.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>She no longer has a character or a will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all know that a couch does not have a will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as we have a will, we can never be the resting place of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To try to rest upon anything with a strong will would be dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But it is easy to rest on a bed or a couch, because it has no will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If our couch or bed had a will, it would be impossible for us to rest during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But now she has become a couch and a palanquin with no will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And eventually she becomes the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ONE WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is quite interesting to see that when the question is asked concerning the one coming out of the wilderness, even the answer shows some improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First, she is the couch, then, she is a palanquin, and finally, she is Solomon with a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She is not simply something with Solomon, but she is Solomon with something.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is just Christ with a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She is not only the couch of Solomon, the palanquin of Solomon, but also Solomon himself with a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This proves that now the seeking one is really one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She has become Christ with a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only when we are one with Christ, can He boast and glory in us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Praise the Lord, someday when others ask about us, the answer will be about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We will be Christ with His crown.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE EXTERNAL STRUCTURE AND THE INTERIOR DECORATION</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With the palanquin there are two aspects: the exterior structure and the interior decoration.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Solomon built a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the substantial structure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Wood signifies humanity, and Lebanon signifies resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The humanity of the resurrected and ascended Christ is the wood of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ can make wild horses into a palanquin with His resurrected and ascended humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A horse is something natural by birth; there is absolutely nothing of building up related to it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is altogether natural.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the palanquin is not something of birth; it is something built up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And the substantial material used for this building is the humanity of Jesus in resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The moving vessel of Christ is not of natural birth, but something built with the resurrected and ascended humanity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not be shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to see something substantial, solid, real, deep, and yet so practical.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How much we must repudiate our old nature and our own humanity!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must learn to take the Lord's resurrected and ascended humanity as our basic structure, so that we may be built into the moving vessel which contains and expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, there is not only the wood of Lebanon, but also the pillars of silver and the golden bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Silver signifies the Lord's redemption, and gold, God's divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The redemption of Christ is our supporting strength, and the divine nature of God is the very base of our building.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to take all of these things in prayer to the Lord that He may bring us into the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must be such a builded structure, not with our natural strength, but with the humanity of Christ, the redemption of Jesus, and the divinity of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Solomon made the palanquin himself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is not that we make it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one can make such a palanquin except Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Throughout the years, the Lord has been working on us with the intention to make a palanquin for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He does not use anything of our natural make-up, but He uses His humanity, His redemption, and the divinity of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is our responsibility?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our responsibility is simply to offer our love to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The interior decoration of the palanquin was fitted with love from the daughters of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must offer our love to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He does not want anything from us other than our love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Simon, son of Jona, lovest thou me more than these?"</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>John 21:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is always seeking our love, and only our love affords something for the interior decoration of the palanquin.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord Jesus made it, but it is decorated with our love.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The basic structure is of wood, silver, and gold, but our love is the only thing with which the interior is decorated.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we love Him, the more we will lose our character and personality.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more we love Him, the more we will lose our will, but the interior of the palanquin will be fully decorated.</S>
