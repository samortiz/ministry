	<h2 class="head1">THE MIND WHICH WAS IN CHRIST</h2><p>Let us now consider verses 5 through 8 in more detail. In verse 5 Paul says, &ldquo;Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus.&rdquo; The Greek words translated <i>let this mind be in you</i> can also be rendered &ldquo;think this in you.&rdquo; The word <i>this</i> refers to the counting and regarding in verses 3 and 4. This kind of thinking, mind, attitude, was also in Christ when He emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, and humbled Himself, being found in fashion as a man (vv. 7-8). To have such a mind requires us to be one with Christ in His inward parts (1:8). To experience Christ, we need to be one with Him to such an extent, that is, in His tender inward feeling and in His thinking.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STEPS OF CHRIST&rsquo;S HUMILIATION</h2><p>Verse 6 says, &ldquo;Who subsisting in the form of God did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered <i>subsisting</i> denotes existing from the beginning. It implies the Lord&rsquo;s eternal preexistence.</p><p>The word <i>form</i> refers to the expression, not the fashion, of God&rsquo;s being (Heb. 1:3). It is identified with the essence and nature of God&rsquo;s Person and thus expresses His essence and nature. This refers to Christ&rsquo;s deity.</p><p>In verse 6 Paul tells us that Christ did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped. Although the Lord was equal with God, He did not consider this equality a treasure to be grasped and retained. Rather, He laid aside the form of God, not the nature of God, and emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave.</p><h2 class="head2">Emptying Himself<br />and Taking the Form of a Slave</h2><p>Verse 7 goes on to say that Christ &ldquo;emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.&rdquo; When Christ emptied Himself, He laid aside what He possessed&mdash;the form of God. The word <i>form</i> in verse 7 is the same word as used for the form of God in verse 6. In His incarnation, the Lord did not alter His divine nature, but only His outward expression of the form of God to that of a slave. This was not a change of essence; it was a change of state. The word <i>becoming</i> indicates entering into a new state.</p><h2 class="head2">Becoming in the Likeness of Men</h2><p>According to verse 7, Christ became in the &ldquo;likeness of men.&rdquo; The form of God implies the inward reality of Christ&rsquo;s deity; the likeness of men denotes the outward appearance of His humanity. He appeared outwardly to men as a man, but inwardly He had the reality of deity.</p><h2 class="head2">Humbling Himself and Becoming Obedient<br />unto the Death of the Cross</h2><p>Verse 8 continues, &ldquo;And being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross.&rdquo; When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men. The word <i>fashion</i> implies the outward guise, the semblance. What Christ looked like in His humanity was found by men to be in fashion as a man.</p><p>Being found in fashion as a man, Christ humbled Himself. First He emptied Himself by putting aside the form, the outward expression, of His deity and becoming in the likeness of men. Then He humbled Himself by becoming obedient even unto death. Christ was God with the expression of God. Although He was equal with God, He put aside this equality and emptied Himself by taking the likeness of men. This indicates that He became a man through incarnation. Then, being found in the appearance of a man, He humbled Himself. This means that when He was a man, He did not insist on anything. Rather, He humbled Himself to the point of dying on the cross. This is Christ as our pattern.</p><p>Humbling Himself was a further step in emptying Himself. Christ&rsquo;s self-humbling manifests His self-emptying. The death of the cross was the climax of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation. To the Jews this was a curse (Deut. 21:22-23). To the Gentiles it was a death sentence imposed upon malefactors and slaves (Matt. 27:16-17, 20-23). Hence, it was a shameful thing (Heb. 12:2).</p><p>The Lord&rsquo;s humiliation involves seven steps: emptying Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men, humbling Himself, becoming obedient, being obedient even unto death, and being obedient unto the death of the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING A CRUCIFIED LIFE</h2><p>The pattern presented in these verses is now the life within us. This life is what we call a crucified life. The seven steps of Christ&rsquo;s humiliation are all aspects of the crucified life. Although Christ had the expression of deity, He laid aside this expression. However, He did not lay aside the reality of His deity. He laid aside the higher form, the form of God, and took on a much lower form, the form of a slave. In this, He emptied Himself. Surely this is a mark of a crucified life. Then, after becoming a man and being found in the appearance of a man, Christ humbled Himself even unto the death of the cross. This was the crucified life lived out in a full and absolute way.</p><p>Christ is not only an outward pattern for us; He is also the life within us. As this inner life, He would have us experience Him and thereby live a crucified life. In this crucified life there is no room for rivalry, vainglory, or self-exaltation. On the contrary, there is self-emptying and self-humbling. Whenever we experience Christ and live Christ, we automatically live such a crucified life. This means that when we live Christ, we live the One who is the pattern of a crucified life. Then we also shall empty ourselves and humble ourselves.</p><p>If we did not have the crucified life within us, we could never live according to the pattern presented in Philippians 2. Only the crucified life can live such a pattern. If we still do things out of rivalry and vainglory or are still ambitious to be leaders or elders, we are not living a crucified life. We are not emptying ourselves or humbling ourselves. However, we have a life within us that truly is a self-emptying and self-humbling life. This life never grasps at something as a treasure. Instead, it is always willing to lay aside position and title.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN BECOMING OUR SALVATION</h2><p>When the pattern in Philippians 2 becomes our inward life, the pattern becomes our salvation. Then we are saved from rivalry and vainglory. If the Philippians were not willing to live according to this pattern, they could not make Paul&rsquo;s joy full. He would still be troubled by their rivalry and vainglory. But if they were willing to live the crucified life, a life that always empties itself and humbles itself, not grasping anything as a treasure, they would have the genuine experience of Christ. Their experience of Christ as such a pattern and inward life would make the apostle extremely happy.</p><p>Living a crucified life shows that toward the apostles we have encouragement in Christ, consolation of love, fellowship of spirit, and tenderheartedness and compassion. Only when we live a crucified life can we make the apostles happy and cause their joy to be full. In prison Paul was not concerned with how he was treated by others. His concern was whether or not the believers would take Christ as their pattern and live a crucified life. This was the desire of Paul&rsquo;s heart, and only this would make his joy full.</p>
