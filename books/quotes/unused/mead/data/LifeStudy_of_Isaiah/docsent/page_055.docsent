   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Standing as a Standard to the Peoples</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Isaiah 11:10 says, "In that day the root of Jesse,/Who stands as a banner to the peoples /Him will the nations seek,/And His resting place will be the glory."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that Christ is also the root of Jesse and that His resting place will be the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Where He rests, there the glory is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Glory is God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Where Christ is, there is God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The expressed God is Christ's resting place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, Christ as the twig, the branch, and the root of Jesse is connected to humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, Christ is very much related to God, because where He is, God's expression is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This picture depicts Christ as both God and man, as the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. The Restored Beasts and Cattle 1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Wolf Dwelling with the Lamb</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to verse 6, in the restoration brought in through Christ, the wolf will dwell with the lamb, the leopard will lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a young boy will lead them about.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everything will be peaceful and loving.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Cow and the Bear Grazing,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>and Their Young Lying Down Together</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the restoration, the cow and the bear will graze, and their young will lie down together.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Also, the lion will eat straw like the ox v. 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Nursing Child Playing by the Cobra's Hole</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 8 goes on to tell us that in the restoration the nursing child will play by the cobra's hole, and upon the viper's den the weaned child will stretch his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 9a continues by saying that they will not hurt nor destroy in all Jehovah's holy mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Earth Being Full</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>of the Knowledge of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Furthermore, according to verse 9b, in the restoration brought in through Christ, the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The question I have when reading these verses is why in the restoration all the different animals will live together so peacefully, pleasantly, and lovingly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I believe that although God did not create the beasts with a negative element in them, as a result of the fall, a negative factor entered into them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Adam fell, sin entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since he, the head of all the creatures, became fallen, something of Satan also entered into them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the restoration this negative factor will be removed, causing a change not only in outward action but also in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reason for this change is given in verse 9 the knowledge of God, that is, the knowing of God, will fill the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ's restoring power will deliver all the creatures from the poisonous element of Satan, and as a result the situation among them will be pleasant, peaceful, and loving.</S>
