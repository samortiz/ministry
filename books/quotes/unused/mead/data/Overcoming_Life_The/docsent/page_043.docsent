   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BOASTING OF KING JEHOSHAPHAT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Old Testament, there was a king of Judah by the name of Jehoshaphat.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us read 2 Chronicles 20 to learn about his tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time, the children of Moab, and the children of Ammon, and with them other besides the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle v. 1 . At the time of Jehoshaphat, the kingdom of Judah was very weak and helpless in fighting against its enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jehoshaphat was, of course, afraid when he looked at himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He could do nothing before, and he could do nothing now.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the enemies came again, what could he do?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet he was a man who feared God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah v. 3 . He could do nothing except come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He prayed to the Lord, O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee v. 12 . He acknowledged his helplessness, and his eyes were set upon the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brothers and sisters, during the past few days, we have repeated the conditions for surrendering many times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are: 1 to realize that we cannot make it, and 2 to stop trying to make it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should also believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was what Jehoshaphat did.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He acknowledged this by saying that he did not have the strength to withstand the enemy and did not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He could only look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God sent a prophet to him immediately, and said to him, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God s v. 15 . The battle is the Lord s! Victory or failure has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Temper, pride, doubt, unclean thoughts, greed, and all kinds of sins have nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The battle is not ours, but God s. God has said, Ye shall not need to fight in this battle v. 17 . God demands only that we stand still.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He wants us to put down our hands and leave everything up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need only to stand still and see the salvation of the Lord v. 17 . Brothers and sisters, we are not the ones who are fighting; we are the spectators.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever we stop boasting in victory, we fail.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do not have to be afraid before God, because He is the One who will battle for us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jehoshaphat did one thing more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He not only stood still and watched the battle, but he also fell down on his face to worship God when he heard the word of the prophet!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem also fell before the Lord and worshipped Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Others were joining hands to attack them, but what were they doing on their part?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They asked a group of Levites to stand up to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They were in holy array v. 21, ASV , and they went before the army to praise Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Were they crazy?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They were not afraid of rocks and arrows; they were singing praises to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the tone of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They had the tone of victory because they knew that Jehovah had given them the victory and that the enemies were already defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They knew that they had already won the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some believe that when temptations come, they should struggle and withstand them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God said, And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten v. 22 . Whenever songs of praises are sung to the Lord, the enemies are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What was the result?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And when Judah came toward the watchtower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped v. 24 . Either God does not give the victory at all, or He gives a victory in which no one escapes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If it were up to us, we might leave five or six persons behind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God did not leave one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The words when they began in verse 22 are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the people were beginning to sing, the Lord set an ambush against the Ammonites, Moabites, and children of Mount Seir.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Brothers and sisters, God can work only when we begin to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever we begin to praise, God begins to work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers and sisters, I know that we are faced with many temptations, and I know that we have many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There may be physical weaknesses, adverse circumstances, or various difficulties at work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We may say, What should I do?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How can I overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Brothers and sisters, we know that we should overcome, but our tone is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When temptations come, we should say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When trials come, we should say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we see difficulties come, we should say, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once we shout, Hallelujah, the enemies will be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we praise, our God will begin to work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once we begin to sing, He begins to work.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to acknowledge that we cannot make it, and it is not enough to believe that God can make it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to shout from our heart, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thank You, God, because I am under trials.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank You, God, because I cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thank You, God, because the victory is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Jehoshaphat continued to sing because he believed that he had overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the eyes of Jehoshaphat, everyone was already a dead corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Consequently, he could go on and sing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was not afraid of the rocks, because he considered his enemies as already being dead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When they went up to the watchtower and looked, there were only dead bodies fallen to the earth.</S>
