<p>This book is a collection of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei and Manila in 1953. It contains eight chapters. The first four are words of fellowship given to the brothers and sisters in college concerning how to know God&rsquo;s work, how to know the Lord&rsquo;s leading, and how to know the way of the church, as well as certain life matters closely related to young people, such as consecration, the pursuit of education, and service.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 are words of fellowship related to the prospect and goal of the work in Southeast Asia and concerning how man is God&rsquo;s bridge and God&rsquo;s channel. Chapter 7 speaks of how God is the center of human life and how He regulates and balances man. Chapter 8 is a word of fellowship given at the conclusion of the co-workers&rsquo; training in 1953 concerning the proper exercise and learning of those who serve the Lord.</p>
