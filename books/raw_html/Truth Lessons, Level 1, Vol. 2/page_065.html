<h1 class="title">TEXT</h1><h2 class="head1">I. THE DESIGNATIONS</h2><p>The kingdom of God has many aspects, as revealed in the New Testament by the following different designations:</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Kingdom of God</h2><p>The kingdom of God (Matt. 12:28) is a general term that refers to God&rsquo;s reign (Matt. 6:10, 13b; Dan. 6:26b). Its scope is unlimited, comprising eternity past, the patriarchs, the nation of Israel in the Old Testament, the church in the New Testament in this age, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the new heaven and new earth in eternity future. The words spoken by the Lord in Matthew 21:43 and the parable preceding it in verses 33-41 show us that the kingdom of God was there with the children of Israel in the Old Testament, but due to their rejection of the Lord, it was given to the church in the New Testament.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>The kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 16:19) refers to the ruling of the heavens (Dan. 4:26). It began on the day of Pentecost when Christ poured out the Holy Spirit and established His church (Acts 2), and it will continue until the end of the millennium (Rev. 20:7). Its scope is narrower than that of the kingdom of God, since it includes only the church in this age and the millennial kingdom in the coming age. It is a section within the kingdom of God; hence, it is also called the kingdom of God (Mark 1:15, cf. Matt. 4:17; Mark 4:11, cf. Matt. 13:11). The kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: its reality, its appearance, and its manifestation. Its reality and its appearance are the inward and outward aspects of the church in this age; its manifestation will be in the millennial kingdom in the coming age.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Kingdom of God&rsquo;s Beloved Son</h2><p>The kingdom of the Son of God&rsquo;s love (Col. 1:13) is composed of the church in this age, the millennial kingdom in the coming age, and the new heaven and new earth in eternity (cf. 2 Pet. 1:11). The emphasis in Colossians 1:13 is on the kingdom of God&rsquo;s beloved Son in this age as the reality of the church, into which all the believers have been transferred (John 3:5).</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Kingdom of Christ and of God,<br />the Kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ,<br />and the Eternal Kingdom of the Lord<br />and Savior Jesus Christ</h2><p>The kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5), the kingdom of the Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15), and the eternal kingdom of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 1:11), all refer to the millennial kingdom in the coming age and to the new heaven and new earth in eternity as His eternal kingdom which will be brought in by Christ&rsquo;s second coming (Dan. 2:34-35, 44; Heb. 1:8). The overcoming believers in the church in this age, the defeated ones not included, will first enter into the millennial kingdom in the coming age to inherit the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium as their reward; and then they, together with the believers who are defeated in this age but will be perfected in the millennium, will enter into the new heaven and new earth in eternity to enjoy the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth as their eternal portion.</p><h2 class="head2">E. The Kingdom of the Father<br />and the Kingdom of the Son of Man</h2><p>The kingdom of the Father mentioned in Matthew 13:43 and 26:29 refers to the heavenly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age, which is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Only the perfected saints in the Old Testament and the overcoming believers in the church in this age will be able to enter into and enjoy this kingdom (Heb. 12:23; 11:39-40; Matt. 8:11; 13:43). The kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41) refers to the earthly part of the millennial kingdom in the coming age. It is the kingdom prepared for the nations who will be restored in the coming age as its people (Matt. 25:34). It is also the kingdom in which the restored kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6), that is, all Israel who will be saved in the future, will be the priests (See point III.B.1 in this lesson).</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Kingdom Prepared<br />from the Foundation of the World</h2><p>The kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world (Matt. 25:34) is the earthly part of the millennial kingdom, in which the restored nations will dwell as the people (Matt. 25:46b).</p>
