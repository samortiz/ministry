   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the Head of the church Eph 1:22 , the universal new man, and Christ is also the Body 1 Cor 12:12; Col 3:11 .</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If verse 11 ended with "Christ is all," we might feel that Christ has replaced the members in the church.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This very all-inclusive Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In eternity past the Triune God was not consummated, but by passing through the processes of incarnation, human living, the all-inclusive death, and resurrection, He was consummated to be the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
