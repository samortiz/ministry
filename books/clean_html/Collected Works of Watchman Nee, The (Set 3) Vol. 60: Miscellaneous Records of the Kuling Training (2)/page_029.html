Concerning this point, Paget Wilkes has written in much detail. We will quote some of his words. [Translator's note: we are not able to find the original quotations; the following is a translation from Chinese.]</p><p>In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus said, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." The Lord called those who toil and are burdened to come for rest. This creates a sense of need in man. Some people are satisfied with their human life; they do not feel the need for salvation. We have to create in them a need, a dissatisfaction, so that they will feel the need for salvation.</p><p>Luke 4:18-19 says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to send away in release those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord." This was the Lord's proclamation at the time He began His ministry. Here the Lord pointed out the two kinds of people His gospel is directed toward: those who have need and those who sin.</p><p>In Romans 1:29-31 Paul enumerated twenty-one kinds of sins committed by man. On the one hand, man has needs. On the other hand, he has sins. Man is ignorant of both of these things. A preacher of the gospel should create a sense of need as well as a sense of sin within men. In China it is easier to give people a sense of need than a sense of sin. For those who understand the gospel but who are not saved, our preaching should awaken a sense of sin in them because they are more prone to have a feeling of sin.</p><p>The Chinese are utilitarians. This is the reason that the Chinese do not ask for forgiveness of sins when they pray to their idols. Instead, they ask for blessing and goodwill. In preaching to the Chinese, it is very hard to invoke a sense of sin in them. Yet unless they are conscious of their sins before God, it is not easy for them to be saved. In preaching the gospel to them, we have to first plant within them a sense of their offenses against God, not just a sense of sin per se. Our preaching should not only invoke the sense of sin in general, but a sense of offense against God. If a man has only the sense of sin without a sense of offense against God, he is like a dog or a sow. Eventually, he will return to his own vomit and wallow in his own mud. Since the Sung dynasty in China, Confucianism has pointed out the struggle between reason and lust. Yet the Chinese are only aware of the sin which dwells within them; they are not aware of their offenses against God. They have no consciousness of such a thing. They can understand a teaching on deliverance from sin, but they cannot understand a teaching on forgiveness by God. If a man claims to be saved yet does not see his utter depravity and offense against God, his salvation is not firm.</p><p>Therefore to preach the gospel in China, we must not only help men have a sense of sin but must show them that they have offended the living God. Only then will they be saved. This is not easy, and we have to use all kinds of methods to support the Holy Spirit in His good works within man. Once the Holy Spirit works on man, he will have a sense that he has offended God. Although a man does not have such a sense before he is saved, he will have such a sense once the Holy Spirit operates within him.</p>
