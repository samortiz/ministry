<H1 CLASS=TITLE>QUESTION AND ANSWER BOX</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(6)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 11</H2><P>If anyone desires to ask biblical or spiritual questions, he may send letters to the editor. We will try our best to answer them. Please forgive us for not answering unprofitable questions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PARADISE</H2><P>Question: Paradise is mentioned in Luke 23:43, Revelation 2:7, and 2 Corinthians 12:4. Is there any difference between them? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: The Paradise in Revelation 2:7 is "the Paradise of God" which is the New Jerusalem in the future. We can see this by considering the tree of life which is in the midst of it. The Paradise in Luke 23 and 2 Corinthians 12 refers to the Paradise underneath the earth where the dead believers go.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TRANCE</H2><P>Question: What is meant by trance in Acts 10:10 and 22:17? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: A trance is when the Holy Spirit causes the saints to leave their bodies temporarily and enter into the spiritual realm to receive supernatural vision. John's revelation is such a one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF SAMUEL</H2><P>Question: In the whole chapter of 1 Samuel 28, witchcraft was used by the medium to bring up Samuel. Was it his soul or body that came up? Why did he come up from underneath the earth? (Liu, Feng Village)</P><P>Answer: It was his spirit, because his body had been buried and had already decayed. The spirit also has its form. Therefore, the rich man in Hades still had eyes, a tongue, and so forth. Both Hades and Paradise are underneath the earth. This is why Samuel came up from underneath the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION FOR THOSE<br>WHO NEVER HEARD THE GOSPEL</H2><P>Question: Before the gospel of the Lord came to China, there were many God-fearing, righteous people who had not heard the gospel and had no knowledge to believe in the Lord. May I ask, how did these people get saved? (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: One thing is certain, "There is no respect of persons with God" (Rom. 2:11). Romans 2:7-8, 12-15 refers to this question.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BAPTIZER</H2><P>Question: Baptism by immersion is the most scriptural method. It is the Lord's command. But my previous baptism was not by immersion. I am aware of the fact that this is incomplete, and I really hope to be baptized by immersion in the near future. I do not know who should be the baptizer or whether there are any qualifications for such a one. Please answer in detail. (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: It is correct to say that baptism by immersion is most scriptural. There is no reason that any faithful child of God should be excused. Baptism by a pastor is part of the system of the denominations today. However, is this the teaching of the Bible? Where is there such an ordinance in the Bible? This is but a poison of the Roman Catholic Church that has not been completely removed from the denominations! In the Bible baptism is committed to the "disciples" (Matt. 28:16, 19). The disciples were the Christians (Acts 11:26). Hence, every disciple, or Christian, can baptize others. All who believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior can baptize others. Aside from this, all are human traditions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RELEASING SATAN</H2><P>Question: In Revelation 20:7-8, since Satan has been locked up by then, and can be thrown into the lake of fire any time, why is he loosed to deceive many? (Lai, Chingliu)</P><P>Answer: It is very difficult for men to explain what God has ordained. However, in the millennium many people will still be born. They cannot be identified as being good or evil unless they are tested by Satan. Furthermore, it seems that without this step, the millennium cannot come to a proper end, and the new heaven and new earth cannot be ushered in.</P>
