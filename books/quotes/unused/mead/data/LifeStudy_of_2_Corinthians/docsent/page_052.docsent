   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>INSCRIBING CHRIST INTO THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul also knew how to use the divine typewriter to write Christ on others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever he was with the saints, he would write Christ upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul knew Christ in a detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He also knew how to write living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If Paul were to speak with you for a period of time, a certain amount of Christ, perhaps a paragraph, would be written on your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul uses the word inscribe to portray the way he wrote living letters of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His writing did not merely write Christ on the saints; it inscribed Christ into them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In my ministry I also endeavor to follow Paul to inscribe Christ into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not my desire merely to pass on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not even like to talk about being one spirit with the Lord simply as a doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, I care for the writing of Christ in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the saints will receive not only the knowledge of doctrine, but the actual inscribing of Christ in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose a brother learns the doctrine that he is one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this doctrine may not help him in his relationship with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if a brother has Christ inscribed into him, he will experience being one spirit with the Lord in his married life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a proof that he has been helped by the ministry that inscribes Christ into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul, a pattern of living Christ for the church, was made competent, sufficient, qualified, to write living letters.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His qualification was of Christ and of all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Paul s spiritual writings, Christ was every letter, word, sentence, paragraph, and chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This inscribing of Christ into others is a deeper aspect of living Christ for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My concern is not only for living Christ, but also for inscribing Christ into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This inscribing of Christ into others is not for my work; it is for the church so that God s administration may be carried out and His eternal purpose may be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord s recovery has a very promising future.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The future is bright because Christ is all the letters of the heavenly alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I believe that in the years to come the Lord will use many of the saints to inscribe Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These saints will not preach the gospel merely in a doctrinal way; they will write Christ into the inner being of others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who hear such a preaching of the gospel may not remember all the doctrinal points, but they will not be able to erase the Christ who has been written into them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We also may forget many of the messages we have heard.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, Christ has been inscribed into us, and He remains in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if you rebel against the Lord, you will not be able to remove what has been inscribed of Christ into you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some have written to me saying that they are not able to forget the Christ I ministered to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though they do not agree with me in certain matters, they still appreciate my ministering Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This proves that we cannot erase the Christ who has been inscribed into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Religion is a matter of mere doctrine, not of the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many are still arguing over doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in the Lord s recovery we care for Christ in a deep way, not in a superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We want to go deeper than the feathers and skin to touch the meat of Christ, to experience Christ as the deep things of God to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I came to this country with a positive burden to write Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sinners are not the only ones who need to have Christ written on them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even pastors, theologians, and professors need more of Christ written into their being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some have spent a great deal of time to gain academic knowledge, but they do not have much of Christ written into them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some have a thorough knowledge of the Greek language; however, they do not experience Christ as all the letters of the heavenly alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>LETTERS OF CHRIST READ BY OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, we should seek to write Christ on others; on the other hand, we are living letters of Christ, living epistles, and others can read the Christ who has been inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Young people, when you visit your parents, be assured that they are reading the Christ who has been written into you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may read you in a secret way, without letting you know that they are reading you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some may even oppose you and criticize the church life in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I would encourage you not to be bothered by this kind of opposition or criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Instead of being offended or discouraged, you need to realize that your parents are reading the Christ who has been inscribed into you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sometimes even opposition is a sign that others are reading us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I know of many cases of parents who eventually turned to the Lord s recovery because of what they read of Christ in their children.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A father may repent, weep in the presence of his son, and say to him, Son, I am sorry for the way I offended you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Over the years I opposed you and even rebuked you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But all the time I was reading you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I must admit that I saw something in you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What I have seen in you now causes me to weep before you and before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I would like to go with you to one of the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Parents who oppose their children may later come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It may take time for a young person to exhibit before his parents the Christ who has been written into him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But after a while the parents will be convinced of the genuineness of this experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Young people, when you visit your parents, you should exhibit Christ to them, but you should not perform in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Neither should you try to defend the Lord s recovery by arguing with your parents or by claiming to know many things.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Simply be what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul says, By the grace of God I am what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When you visit your parents at home, simply be what you are by the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ has been inscribed into you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Others will be convinced not by your performance, but by what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What a young person is in his being especially convinces his parents, for every parent desires good things to happen to his children.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Eventually, if you continue to have Christ written upon you and manifest this Christ to your parents, they will be convinced and may even decide to follow you into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The important matter is that Christ is inscribed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The more Christ is written into our being, the more others will be able to read Him in us.</S>
