   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT A HEAVENLY MANSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the Father's house in 14:2 is not a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To bring the thought of a heavenly mansion into the Gospel of John can be compared to adding a foreign element to our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every part of our body is organic, but a foreign element added to it will not be an organic part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To bring the thought of a heavenly mansion into the Gospel of John is to inject into it something that is not of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is basically against John's principle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have indicated, if the Father's house in 14:2 refers to a heavenly mansion, this means that today the Lord Jesus is carrying on two kinds of building work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to Matthew 16, the Lord is building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you think that, on the one hand, the Lord is building the church on earth and that, on the other hand, He is building a mansion in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This thought is not logical, and it is also against the divine principle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible clearly reveals that God has two creations: the old creation and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In God's old creation, God did everything by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He simply had to speak, and item after item came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If God had needed a heavenly mansion, it would already have been created.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not correct to say that after God's creation it was necessary for Him to add something to His creation or to remodel it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's second creation, the new creation, does not take place by His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Rather, the new creation is accomplished by Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way He works Himself into God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By such a process He makes His creation divine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The old creation was not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although it was created by God, it did not have anything of God's nature in it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The new creation is different, for it is an entity saturated with God's being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God works Himself into this entity not through speaking it into being, but through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may also add transformation and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the building of God in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not the building of a heavenly mansion in a material sense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the contrary, it is the building up of the Body of Christ organically, and this Body is the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Like the vine in John 15, the Father's house is an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, the Father's house is the oneness for which the Lord Jesus prayed in John 17.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this chapter the Lord prayed that the Father would make all the believers one in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, in chapter seventeen we have the oneness of the believers in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the mingling of the Triune God with His people, and this oneness is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a divine organism, an organism that is Christ's Body, the Father's house, and also a mutual dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this age this dwelling place is the church life, and in eternity it will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the proper understanding of John 14:2.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Kittel's Theological Word Book of the New Testament, it was the Gnostics who used the Greek word for house oikia to refer to a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By this we see that the thought of a heavenly mansion is pagan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This thought is also heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of the Gnostic concept of a heavenly mansion, some expositors have thought that John was under Gnostic influence when he wrote his Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to these expositors, in chapter fourteen John was following the Gnostics to speak of a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, John certainly was not a Gnostic, and he did not use the word oikia to denote a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did not use this word with a Gnostic denotation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Actually, it was not John who used this word as recorded in the Gospel of John; it was the Lord Jesus who spoke of the Father's house, and He surely was not a Gnostic.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Neither did the Lord use any other word with a Gnostic denotation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word of the Lord Jesus in the Gospel of John concerning the Father's house does not refer to a mansion in the heavens; it refers to Christ's mystical Body, that is, to a divine organism composed of the Triune God mingled with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To say that John 14:2 refers to a heavenly mansion is to take in a concept that is Gnostic, pagan, heathen, and heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We surely must utterly abandon such a concept.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This thought is leaven brought in from a pagan source.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the truth has been leavened, I believe that the Lord Jesus will recover the pure truth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As part of this recovery, we must purge out the leaven of a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The thought of going to a heavenly mansion after we die is superstitious, superficial, and false.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is also deceitful, for believers are cheated when they are told that their departed loved ones are now in a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This leaven must be altogether cleared away.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I encourage you to pray over these matters and to have fellowship concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we shall see that, truthfully speaking, there is no such thing as a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is not building a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the contrary, by the Spirit and through His death and resurrection, He is building an organism, the church, which is His Body and the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This house is composed of the mingling of the Triune God with His chosen and redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>May we all be nourished with the truth concerning the mingling of God with us to produce a mutual dwelling place.</S>
