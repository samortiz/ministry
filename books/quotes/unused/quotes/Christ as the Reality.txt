The first important matter in regard to seeing Christ as the reality is to realize that Christ is the reality by which we worship God
To take Christ as our reality means to take Christ as our being, our doing, our living, and even as our worship to God
Just in the one book of Leviticus, we can see all the details of Christ as the reality to us by which we worship God
In the above verses, we have read both the first and last verses of Genesis and Exodus before coming to Leviticus
Whenever there are the words, 'the tabernacle of the congregation' or 'the tent of the congregation,' we should read 'the tent of meeting'
On Mount Sinai, God spoke from the heavens, but since God has a tent of meeting on the earth, He can speak out of it
Out of all the coffins, God raised up a people and brought them out of Egypt to build them together to become the tent of meeting
After Exodus we need the book of Leviticus, because in the tent of meeting God wants to enjoy Christ as the reality
Leviticus is a book of the church life in the meeting, because it covers all the things related to the tent of meeting
The ark is the vessel that contains the Ten Commandments of God, and the Ten Commandments are the very expression and representation of God
Praise the Lord that we have Christ enlarged on the earth as the tent of meeting, and in this tent of meeting there is the dwelling of God
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us'
He as the Word was God, and one day this Word became flesh to tabernacle among us and bring God from heaven to earth in the tent of meeting
If we are only fulfilling a demand, it is not so pleasing, but if we offer a present, how sweet and pleasant it is to God
Note: In order to be more accurate according to the original language, changes should be made in the above verses
Change all the instances of 'bring' to the verb 'present' except in Leviticus 1:15; 'the priest shall bring it unto the altar'
Once the tabernacle is erected, God is no more just the God in the heavens, but the very God on the earth among His people
If we would contact this very God who is now on the earth among His people, we need to pass through this fence
If we would enter the Holy of Holies to meet this righteous, holy, and glorious God, we need to meet all His requirements
Christ as the offerings is capable, qualified, and equipped to meet all the requirements of the divine righteousness, holiness, and glory
On the one hand Christ is the tabernacle for God to come to us, and on the other hand Christ is the offerings for us to go to God
Whether we are good or whether we are bad, whether we are doing right or doing wrong, the pitiful thing is that we are not really for God
If you would read the four Gospels again, you would see a Man living on the earth who was one hundred percent for God
God is hungry; God needs something to satisfy Himself, and this something is the burnt offering offered by His people
God commanded the children of Israel to present the burnt offering every day both in the morning and in the evening
You may say that you will go to the mission field to glorify God, but God would say that He desires food from you today right where you are
If they would be honest, they would say that although they are doing much work to glorify God, yet they are so hungry
According to the record of Leviticus 1, those who present the burnt offering must kill it, flay or skin it, and cut it into pieces
Whenever we come to the meeting, we must come with such a Christ as the burnt offering for us to present to God
The more he experiences Christ as the burnt offering, and presents Him to God in the tent of meeting, the more he is covered with Christ
In the meetings there will be so many who can present Christ as the burnt offering to God and share the covering of Christ
God needs food to satisfy His hunger and the burnt offering according to divine revelation is not just a kind of sacrifice but food for God
There is only a small portion for our enjoyment, that is, the skin for the priest who presents the burnt offering to God
We must realize that God has been hungry for centuries because many Christians have not known how to labor on Christ as the good land
In the tent of meeting, the first thing which we must present is the burnt offering, not for our enjoyment, but for God's enjoyment
We must labor on Christ that we may have something of His surplus to bring to God when we come to the tent of meeting
We must check to see what is the size of the Christ we have experienced and have brought to present to God in the tent of meeting
We need to pray, 'Lord, be gracious to us that we may enlarge our experience of Christ and always have a bullock to present to You'
We must see that to present the burnt offering or even to present all the other offerings, we need four things
Moses told them that when they entered into the good land, they must present their burnt offerings in the very place of God's choice
Once we are resting in Christ inheriting Him as our portion we should not do things according to our eyes but according to the choice of God
For the presenting of the offerings there is the need of a proper place, a place which will keep the unity of the people of God
Through all the centuries the people of Israel have been kept as one as far as their worship to God is concerned
You may have the enjoyment here, but if you go to other places to copy these things, you will immediately lose the enjoyment
The second of the four things which we need in order to properly present the offerings to God is the tent of meeting
As long as they are fellowshipping with the Lord in their home or somewhere else, they feel that it is all right
Leviticus 1:3 says clearly that we must present our burnt offering at the door of the tent of meeting before the Lord
We need the coordination of the body of priests, the priesthood, in order to properly present the burnt offering to God
If our hand has been kept away from Christ, yet we come to the meeting and try to present Him as our burnt offering, it is indeed awkward
When your wife or your husband is cutting you into pieces, if you are one with Christ, you will be willing to be cut
On the other hand, if you quarrel a little with your wife and reason with her in even a small way, you are through
For we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh
If we are all going to be built up together and have a rich recovery of the church, we all must experience these things
We all have cut one another many times, but today we are here in real oneness because we are willing to be cut by one another
The wood is not thrown upon the altar, but arranged in order, and the pieces of the burnt offering are also laid in an arrangement
It is not like the burning of the lake of fire, but the burning on the altar as the burning of the incense altar
Sometimes we are just a little too much in certain things, and sometimes we lack in the things that are necessary
John 12:24 says, 'Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
We are told clearly that the burnt offering is not for our food or satisfaction, but wholly for God's satisfaction
In the burnt offering, the blood is prominent, but with the meal offering, the prominent things are the oil and the frankincense
Not only do we need to see the difference between the burnt offering and the meal offering, but also between manna and the meal offering
As to His divine nature, He is the branch of Jehovah, and as to His human nature, He is the fruit of the earth
And the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord'
Manna is not for God's satisfaction, but the meal offering is for God's satisfaction, and it is a memorial in His presence
Manna is sufficient only to sustain a life in the wilderness, but the meal offering will support a life in the dwelling place of God
Another important point of difference between the manna and the meal offering is that manna never constituted worship to God
We must labor on the good land by tilling the ground, sowing the seed, watering the plants, and reaping the harvest
Solomon says in Proverbs 19:24 that the lazy man, even when he stretches out his hand for food, will not take it back
When we come to the church meeting, we need to offer such a perfect Christ in His humanity as a kind of present to God
Praise the Lord that upon the earth among the human race there was a man so perfect, so even, so fine, and so tender!
Nothing could be so dear and precious to God as a present to Him of the humanity of Jesus in the tent of meeting
The more we enjoy Christ as such a diet the more we will be nourished qualified strengthened and supported to serve God in a priestly way
It is not just to have the Holy Spirit poured upon us, anointing us, but to have the Holy Spirit mingled with us
When the Lord was on earth, whatever He did in all His activities, behavior, and conversation was always a sweet, fragrant manifestation
He never did anything according to His natural concept; He was always in the manifestation of resurrection life
He was not only mingled within with the divine Spirit, but also anointed without with the divine Spirit in the form of a dove
We see that the oil, as a spice of the meal offering, was mingled with the fine flour and was also used to anoint the fine flour
Even before He was crucified and resurrected, there was always something so sweet and fragrant in all His behavior and activities
In the humanity of Jesus, the meal offering, there is the spice of the divine Spirit and the spice of the resurrection life
When we read the biography of Jesus in the four Gospels, we see that all His activities on the earth are forever
The oil, the frankincense, and the salt are the positive spices in the meal offering, but there are also some negative spices
Worldliness, sinfulness, anything related to corruption, and all evil things are likened in the Bible as leaven
We do not like to have a brother who thinks he knows everything nor do we like to have a brother who always says he knows nothing
In the meal offering, which is the humanity of Jesus, there is the killing of the cross, and there is also the resurrection
The meal offering includes the humanity of Jesus, the divinity of Jesus, the cross of Jesus, and the resurrection of Jesus
If we are feeding on such a Jesus, we will have the fine flour, the oil, the salt, and the frankincense, without any leaven or honey
Whether we present Christ as one suffering in the oven or in the pan depends upon our apprehension and experience
Some who bring Christ to the tent of meeting as the meal offering must have this deepest appreciation of His suffering
There is some form, for it is divided into portions, yet it is not so much in form as the cakes and wafers in the oven
As we feed upon the Lords humanity and grow we should have at least a little appreciation of Jesus as the cakes and wafers baked in the oven
Our appreciation and experience of the Lord's humanity must become deeper and deeper, higher and higher, and much more definite in form
Sometimes in the meetings, the testimony of a certain brother gives the sense of something really green, something new and fresh
We must labor on the good land with the expectation that some day we will have a new harvest with many fresh ears
If we have no intention to function in the church life as a priest, we do not have the standing to eat this diet
Strictly speaking, we cannot enjoy Christ properly as the meal offering at home; we must be in the church meetings
We must be ones serving and actively working in the presence of God in His dwelling place; then we have the right position to eat this diet
Many of us can testify that while we enjoy something of Christ at home, we never enjoy Him as much there as we do in the church meeting
The meal offering itself has no leaven or honey in it, and we should not eat any of these negative spices with this offering
Many times after we have enjoyed Christ as the meal offering in the meetings, we are more separated from the world
We mentioned in the last chapter the different appreciations of the Lord Jesus as the burnt offering and the meal offering
Or is it just a little of Christ, not having such a definite form, and with only fine flour and a little oil from the frying pan
Strictly speaking, among today's Christians, there is the service, the work, the preaching, and the teaching, but there is almost no worship
The worship that God desires is that the people of God would bring the very Christ whom they have experienced in their daily life
We must have something of Christ experienced by us to bring to the tent of meeting, which are the meetings of the local church
These verses are unique to the Gospel of Luke because this Gospel more than any other reveals the humanity of Christ
Luke 2:40 says, 'And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him'
When they are still under age, as Jesus was when He was twelve, they must be for God, yet at the same time be subject to their parents
Luke 19:41 says that He wept over Jerusalem: 'And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it'
If we have never rejoiced, if we have never wept, it simply proves that we are not experiencing the man Jesus as our life
The disciples said, 'Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elias did'?
But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities
With the humanity of Jesus as the fine flour, there is the oil as the Spirit anointing, mingling, and saturating Him
Regardless of what kind of situation or circumstance He was in, He was always under the killing in His actions and words
We all need to pray-read these verses at least three or four times, and put them into practice in our daily walk
It is only by feeding upon His humanity in these verses that we will experience His humanity in our daily life
What the Lord is seeking today is the local churches where the saints worship God with their experiences of Christ
All the cakes, wafers, and portions of the meal offering were made and cooked at home and then brought to the tent of meeting
If He were not a perfect man, He could never be the King, the Servant, the Man, or the very God incarnated in a man
If we do not have this humanity, as typified by acacia wood, it is impossible for us to have a proper church as the Body of Christ
There is only one kind of wood that is good for the structure of both the ark and the tabernacle-that is acacia wood
There is only one kind of humanity that is good for God's testimony today in the local church life-that is the humanity of Jesus
If we would pray-read all the verses in Matthew concerning the Lord's humanity, we would see the humanity it takes to be a king
Many years ago, a Christian teacher argued with me, saying that we would all be kings when the Lord comes back
Do you believe that we can be so sloppy in our humanity now, yet when the Lord Jesus returns He will suddenly make us a king?
Sometimes we, and especially the younger brothers and sisters, think that it may be necessary for others to do certain things, but not us
Matthew 8:20 says, 'The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man has nowhere that He may lay His head'
If we seek a way to get the single bedroom for ourselves, that means that we are taking the humanity of foxes, not the humanity of Jesus
Our own humanity can only give an appearance, but we do have His humanity within us that is meek and lowly in heart
In Matthew 12:19-20, there is a quotation from Isaiah: 'He shall not strive nor cry out, nor shall anyone hear His voice in the streets
A bruised reed He shall not break, and smoking flax He shall not quench until He brings forth judgment unto victory'
The older ones said that they could not tolerate the young people because they were too bold, too loud, and too wild
They do not clean the house; they do not wash the dishes; they do not take care of their clothing; they do not do anything
They reasoned together and realized that if they were to say that John's baptism was from heaven, He would ask why they had not believed him
If they were to say that John's baptism was from man, the people would stone them because all believed that John was a prophet
At the beginning of the book of Matthew the Lord took His standing as a man, and at the end of the book He still stood as a man
He said that the Son of Man would sit in the heavens at the right hand of God, and the Son of Man would come on the clouds of heaven
The humanity which is only good for the so-called eleven o'clock service can never be good for the church life
His relatives said that He was beside Himself , but sometimes we need to be the kind of man that is beside himself
When He was feeding the five thousand, He commanded the disciples to make all the people sit down by companies
Most of us would forget about all the fragments, but the Lord was careful not to leave anything in a sloppy way
He poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded'
We must prepare something of Christ and bring it to the tent of meeting to present to God as a kind of memorial
They say that Jesus was only a Jewish man, denying the Lord's divinity and not recognizing that He is the very God incarnated to be a man
They stress the divinity of Christ so much, but they teach and preach very little regarding the humanity of Christ
He took humanity upon Himself, and this very humanity is the main structure for Him to destroy the serpent, the enemy of God
He does not say, And to the seeds, as concerning many, but as concerning one, And to your seed, Who is Christ'
By the one man, Adam, we were all constituted sinners, but by another man, Jesus, we were all constituted righteous
He fought the battle against the Catholic Church on this matter saying that if man is to be justified by God it is not by works but by faith
Today some Lutheran pastors hold the teaching of justification by faith, yet they themselves have never been justified
Satan on the one hand has been bruised and destroyed on the cross, yet on the other hand he is still here making trouble
In Jesus all the nations are blessed, and through us as Christians, the people around us should also be blessed
An angel could tell Cornelius to send for a man named Peter, but that angel was not able to speak a word about the gospel
We must be human to preach the gospel, but we must not be human according to our natural self-that is devilish
Only this offering can satisfy God and be a kind of memorial to Him, and only this offering can afford a living for the priesthood
It seems the more we look to the Lord as the mighty Savior to deliver us from our temper, the more temper we have
If we simply learn to enjoy Christ as the meal offering and masticate His humanity all day long, we will see what will happen to our temper
Medical doctors tell us that if we have a certain kind of disease, it indicates that we are short of life supply or vitamins
If we will masticate the humanity of Jesus just like the people in that village ate the fish liver, we will be healed spontaneously
We have been reading the Scriptures for years, and still we have not seen it, simply because we are veiled by our natural concepts
After the Lord's resurrection and ascension, John saw Him walking in the midst of the local churches as the Son of Man
You are the fine flour with which we make the meal offering to bring to the tent of meeting as a present to God the Father'
The man Jesus is the succoring One; He is the aiding One; He is the supporting One; and He is the supplying One
His divinity may be sufficient to succor and supply some angels, but to succor and supply us, He must have His humanity
We must look to the Lord for His mercy that from now on, in all the meetings, what we present to God would be mainly the meal offering
We have seen in the past what the ark and the tabernacle signify: the ark is Christ, and the tabernacle is the enlargement of the ark
The most interesting aspect of this Jesus is not the gold, but the wood, not primarily His divinity, but His humanity
And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing up And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold'
We all know that gold is valuable, weighty, and shining, but in a sense gold is not capable of standing by itself
We need humanity, and we also need divinity, but it is the humanity in the church that causes the church to stand up
As we look at today's situation, we see that in so many places the so-called Christian churches are not standing up, but rather falling down
If we go on from John to the book of Revelation, not only is Jesus Himself the tabernacle, but He is also the church, the New Jerusalem
The church must have God living in it, and this church of the living God is the pillar and base of the reality
By this we see that the manifestation of God in Christ is not only a matter of Christ the Head, but also a matter of His Body, the church
Ye also as living stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ
In 1966 when we covered the matter of the priesthood we pointed out that in the New Testament the word priesthood has two different meanings
In English there is only one word, but in Greek there are two different words with these two different meanings
These two categories typify one thing in two aspects, that is, God's building which is the tabernacle, the house of God
Today as the priests, we are the boards of the tabernacle, but to stand up we must feed on the humanity of Jesus
Suppose that not one of the Israelites offered the meal offering, and the priests did not receive anything as a meal offering
The tabernacle is composed mainly of the boards, and the boards are the priests, who can exist only by feeding on the meal offering
Without the meal offering, there can be no standing boards for the tabernacle, and the whole tabernacle will fall apart
Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ has already created the new man, and then Ephesians 4:24 tells us to put on the new man
The new man has been created, but we need to put on the new man and apply to ourselves what Christ has created on the cross
Wood was the main element which enabled the tabernacle to stand, and the wood was even the main element of the tabernacle
Wood is a type of the humanity of Jesus, indicating that the standing power of the church, today's tabernacle, is the humanity of Jesus
Thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for holders for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold'
If we enjoy the humanity of Jesus we become strong standing boards, but we may not be united with other boards
The fourth bar must have gone halfway across below the middle bar, and the fifth continued the other half at the bottom
Since the middle bar extended from end to end, we can realize that the other four bars must be arranged in this way
We have the number five, since there are five bars, and we have the number three, because there are three layers of the bars
According to typology, the uniting bars are the Holy Spirit, and the rings for the bars are also the Holy Spirit
The last part of Ephesians 1:13 says, 'In Whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise'
In the same book, Ephesians 4:3, we read, 'Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace'
There may be three brothers who all believe in the Lord Jesus; therefore, they are sealed with the Holy Spirit
They have been sealed with the Holy Spirit, but they are short of being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit
Two brothers may be saved and have the sealing of the Holy Spirit, but they may still argue and always act independently of one another
Not only will they have experienced the Holy Spirit as the golden rings, but they will also experience Him as the uniting bars
He is the Spirit of God for He has divinity in Him, and He is also the Spirit of Jesus because humanity is also within Him
The Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man-most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man'
As the Spirit of divinity, He is the ring that seals us, but as the Spirit of humanity, He is the bar that unites us in the ring
For the standing up of the church life, we need the humanity of Jesus, and for the uniting, we also need the humanity of Jesus
He mentions lowliness or humility, meekness or gentleness, longsuffering, and bearing with one another in love
All these are human virtues, and they are all required for keeping the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace
It is not the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of God that is mentioned here, but the Spirit, which is the Spirit of man or the Spirit of humanity
The more they masticate the humanity of the Lord Jesus, the more they will be spontaneously one with each other and with others
The mighty power of Jesus is in His divinity, but lowliness, meekness, and all His human virtues are in His humanity
Now there is something in the universe which never existed before His resurrection-the new uplifted human nature of Jesus!
We do not need to pay so much attention to miracles or to having a victorious life, but we do need to enjoy Jesus as a man
Since we are the boards today, we must be fully united by taking the humanity of Jesus in resurrection with the Triune God
We have seen that the meal offering is a present to God of the humanity of Jesus which we have experienced, enjoyed, and appreciated
The point we must see is that the main element by which Paul was constituted an apostle is the humanity of Jesus
Christ ascended on high and having conquered all His enemies He led captive a corporate train of vanquished foes including Paul the Apostle
He went to the high priests and obtained authority to go to Damascus and bind all those who called on the name of the Lord
Such a constitution required a long time, a long process, for all the elements of the ascended Jesus to be added into Him
Jesus has received all the saved persons from the Father, and all of these, including Saul, eventually become the gifts
Christ received these gifts in His humanity, and then He gave all of these saved ones to His Body for the perfecting of His Body
After His ascension, He did not receive the gifts in the position of the Son of God, but in the position of man
After the Son received us, He sent us, for example, to the church in Los Angeles where we became gifts for the building up of the church
If we spend more time in pray-reading the Word, we will see that God intends to work into us the divine life with a human nature
We need another category of humanity, a new, holy human nature, as mentioned by Andrew Murray in his book, The Spirit of Christ
Brother Watchman Nee used to tell us that some people build up twelve inches by what they do, but tear down fourteen inches by what they are
In the church life, we need the humanity of Jesus much more than the gifts, the so-called baptism, or the knowledge of the Bible
Many of the members of this little babe do not yet function properly because it is short of growth and maturity
The main food which will enable us to grow into mature priests is the meal offering, which signifies the humanity of Jesus
In the church there should be a number of mature ones who labor on the good land to produce the grain for making the meal offering
Regardless of what kind of gifts we have, it is exceedingly easy for us to be carried away and tossed to and fro by the winds of doctrine
They must labor on the land, produce the grain, make the flour, and prepare the meal offering for the tent of meeting
In the last chapter we saw how the humanity of Jesus has so much to do with the making and producing of gifted persons
Christ as the Head of the church received all the useful, gifted persons from the Father in the position of man
Previously, the Spirit had only one element, the divine; now the Spirit of Jesus includes two elements, the divine and the human
The Spirit with the divine essence was there, but the Spirit with both the divine and human essence was not yet
We realized that some might accuse us of teaching heresy when we said that the human essence is in the Holy Spirit
According to the light we received from the Lord and the experiences we had had in the past, we saw that this is absolutely the truth
We know how the Son, who had from eternity been with the Father, entered upon a new stage of existence when He became flesh
He could do this, not by an exercise of Divine Power on man, but only in the path of a free, moral, and most real human development
In virtue of His atonement, man now had a right and title to the fulness of the Divine Spirit, and to His indwelling, as never before
The Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man-most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man
He can now come down to witness of the perfect union of the Divine and the human, and in becoming our life, to make us partakers of it
The form is low, but if the seed is sown in the earth, it grows, through decay and death, from a lower degree to a higher
His form was low, but by His crucifixion and resurrection, His form became higher, yet it still remained the same nature
By this we realize that today the Spirit of Jesus has not only the divine essence, but also the human essence of Jesus
Few Christians today have the concept that when they drink of Jesus they are not only drinking of a divine Person but also of a human being
We must drink not only of the Spirit of God, but of the Spirit of an exalted Person, the Spirit of an exalted Man
Perhaps you have never had the desire to be an angel, but you did hope to be a spiritual person full of power and able to do many miracles
As a husband, the Lord's humanity will strengthen you to be a husband who is absolutely agreeable with God's economy
If we are drinking daily of the Spirit of Jesus whatever we are will be a flow of life that will satisfy not only ourselves but also others
To be a mother is a very human matter, but you should not be a mother by your own humanity, but by the humanity of Jesus
The other teachers and students would realize that there is something satisfying, living, and flowing within you
There is no other way to have such a flow of life but by enjoying the humanity of Jesus by drinking of the Spirit of Jesus all the time
We are not drinking of the Spirit for power, might, or miracles, but we are drinking of the Spirit of Jesus for the humanity of Jesus
According to the Bible, the spiritual warfare is between Satan and God, yet God would never fight the battle by Himself
The spiritual warfare between the enemy and the saints is not so much in divine power, but in the proper humanity
In other words, if we are not proper in humanity, it is impossible for us to defeat Satan; we are defeated already
Under the sovereignty of God, there is a boundary line drawn by Him to preserve the human spirit for His purpose
According to the revelation of the Bible, Satan has liberty to do whatever he can to damage our mentality and our body
According to our experience it is easy to deal with demon possession but it is really difficult for any Christian to deal with a mental case
By considering how greatly they have changed from 1965 until today, we may realize how much the enemy is working
He injects all his evil, satanic, devilish concepts and ideas into the young and fresh mentality of the young generation
All the young brothers and sisters in the church life must be clear that the source of all this damage in the mentality is Satan
He first injects so many devilish concepts into the mentality of the young people, and the first issue of this is fornication
If you study the proper statistics, you will see that the number of suicides is much larger than it was five years ago
We all need to keep our body in sanctification and honor because our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and a member of Christ
A proper humanity is one not only with a strong, living spirit, but also one with a sound mind and a body kept in sanctification
Such a humanity has a strong, living spirit, a clear, healthy, and sober mind, and a body kept in sanctification
We are not fighting against flesh and blood or any human beings, but against the principalities, the powers, and the darkness in the air
By ourselves we cannot be such a person, but He is such a Person in us, and His humanity is such a proper humanity for the spiritual warfare
The function of the deacons, who care for the church business and church affairs, is also included in the church service
All those who know the Bible agree that the two books written by the Apostle Paul to Timothy cover this matter of the church service
Paul says that he writes these things that we may know how to behave ourselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God
Eventually what they were and what they did became a distraction and damage to the building up of the local church
They were capable persons, yet they did not have the qualifications mentioned by the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 3
They may build up twelve inches by their spiritual capabilities, but eventually they tear down fourteen inches by what they are
We all know what it means to be temperate to exercise selfcontrol and to be forbearing gentle patient and to make allowances for others
Timothy 3:8 says, 'Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not seeking gain by base means'
Paul says, 'I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and reasoning'
If the sisters take the humanity of Jesus, this humanity will give them a sober understanding in the way they should wear their clothing
We should not remain as a piece of clay, but be transformed by the Lord's humanity into precious materials for God's building
How much the church life will spread and be prevailing depends upon what kind of humanity the young people practice in the church life
We will not only be a strong testimony to human society, but also a strong protest to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places
In the past five or six years, Satan has sought to destroy this country because he knows the Lord needs it for His recovery
We should not be like so many defeated Christians who say that it is impossible to have the proper church life
Praise You, Lord, that You are going to build up a strong church in this city that will really shame the enemy'
The church today does not need the teachings; the church is short of the real realization of the humanity of Jesus
There are three kinds of serving ones in the church: the elders, the deacons and deaconesses, and the workers for the Lord
Many young sisters, before they were married, thought that they were indeed wonderful, but marriage became a real exposure to them
Before we are enlightened in the church, we may not admit that we are wrong; we may not admit any kind of evil or corruption in ourselves
On one hand we need to be exposed by the divine light but on the other hand after being exposed we have the covering of the redeeming blood
He only wants us to see how worthless and hopeless we are in our humanity so that we may learn to take His humanity
We all know that the two books to Timothy and the one to Titus were written in the latter time of Paul's ministry
These books are quite different from Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and other books which were written in his earlier ministry
There will be the manifestation of the humanity of Jesus in the schools, on the jobs, and wherever the brothers and sisters are
Paul mentions something concerning the matter of humanity in these three books, and he also speaks of human virtues in Philippians 4:8
He also tells us in this book that we are the children of God as lights shining in this world among a crooked and perverted generation
Healing is something which is performed outwardly, but gentleness, meekness, and self-control are part of one's being
Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, once said that God pays more attention to what we are than what we do
Rather, the proper humanity shining forth through the young brothers and sisters will be a strong testimony and remedy to this present age
The more we apply, experience, and live by the humanity of Jesus, the more we will be the salt to this corrupted and corrupting generation
We all need the real transformation that comes from the application of the humanity of Jesus in our daily walk
The burnt offering and the meal offering are the basic offerings, and all the other offerings are built upon them
History tells us that the Roman Empire began to decline at exactly the same time as the church, during the last part of the first century
Paul said that in the last days perilous times would come, and it was not long before this prophecy was fulfilled
History tells us that by the end of the first century, there was much corruption and ruin in the society of the Roman Empire
All the verses related to these serving ones mention something concerning the human virtues of the proper humanity
Paul did not tell Timothy to be an example in power, but in love, in word, and in the way he conducted himself
To deal with the older brothers and sisters as well as the young brothers and sisters requires the uplifted humanity of Jesus
The mood today is to be ungrateful to parents ungrateful to grandparents ungrateful to brothers and sisters and even ungrateful to country
In the prophecies of the Bible, there is always a double fulfillment: one at the present time, and the other in the future
In the midst of the degradation of the churches and the corruption of society, we are here for the Lord's recovery
Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
We have to call on the Lord, we must breathe in the Word, and we must do these things in a Body way in the church life
By exercising our spirit to call on Him and to breathe in the Word in a corporate way, we simply enjoy His humanity
The proper enjoyment of the humanity of Jesus will swallow up all the negative things and replace them with all the positive things
In the above verses, we can see from Genesis 1 to the end of Revelation that humanity has much to do with God's kingdom
The word over is used five times in Genesis 126one time for the living things in the air and three times for the living things on the earth
At the end of the Lord's prayer, we have the words, 'Yours is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory forever'
God's intention is to build a kingdom on the earth, and in this kingdom God will be free to exercise His authority and power
If we put these chapters together, we can see that the kingdom of God mentioned in Romans 14 is just the church
Satan told God that Job feared Him simply because He blessed him, and if God were to take away all the blessings, Job would not fear Him
For all of these so-called 'ex-hippies' to take the Lord's humanity for a proper human life is the biggest shame to Satan
Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21, and Ephesians 5:3-5 are verses which show us the humanity which is not fit for God's kingdom
These verses mean that if we do not have the proper human virtues, we are finished as far as the kingdom of God is concerned
Paul says in Ephesians 5 that we should not allow these negative things to be even named among us as is fitting for saints
Finally, when we come to the end of the Bible, we see the overcomers who will reign with Christ a thousand years
When we come to present Christ to God as the peace offering, we need to exercise our spirit to declare that we are one with Christ
You may enjoy the Lord in other aspects, but you cannot enjoy the Lord as the peace offering in any place but in the tent of meeting
The offering was killed on the altar by the presenter, and then the priest sprinkled the blood around the altar
It was not for God, but for the presenter, for when the presenter looked at the blood, he immediately had peace
Besides the cakes, he shall present for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings'
We all must realize that though there are five kinds of offerings, yet only two are the base: the burnt offering and the meal offering
If we are going to offer Christ as the peace offering, we need many experiences of Christ as the meal offering
The more we experience Christ as the meal offering by enjoying His humanity, the more we will enjoy Him as the peace offering
Corinthians 10:18 refers to the peace offering, for it says that the people of Israel ate the sacrifices and were partakers of the altar
The second party to enjoy the peace offering is the serving priest who sprinkles the blood and offers the fat unto God
The proper way to have the Lord's table is not simply a matter of singing hymns, praising, and praying while taking the bread and the wine
There must be the enjoyment for God, for the serving ones, for the priesthood, for the presenter, and for all the attendants who are clean
As the redeemed ones, we have peace with God, we have peace with one another, and we even have peace with ourselves
We all must realize that the Lord's table is a feast with Christ as the peace offering for all five parties to enjoy
God is here, the serving ones are here, the priests are here, and the presenters with all the children of God are here
When all five parties are together we do not sit inactively, but trumpet and proclaim to the universe, 'What a Christ we have'!
What we bring to the meeting is the very Christ whom we have experienced as the burnt offering and the meal offering
We cannot appreciate them so deeply, and we cannot apprehend the mystery, but we can present them to God and let God enjoy this hidden part
All the fat of the inwards and all the tender, sweet, and precious parts are for God's appreciation and God's enjoyment
The leg as we have pointed out signifies the walking strength and the different kinds of cakes signify the rich nourishment and satisfaction
In addition to this, we have the right to enjoy the flesh, because we are one of the clean ones among God's people
The serving ones have the right to enjoy everything but God's portion, which is too deep and too mysterious for them
The unclean ones must be cut off from the church fellowship, and that is the meaning of the term 'excommunication'
Whenever we come to participate in the fellowship of the Lord's table, we must realize that this is a holy matter
The humanity of Jesus is very basic in our experience in order for us to bring the peace offering to the Lord's table
The children of Israel did not have the right to enjoy the passover lamb without the sprinkling of the blood upon the outside of the house
Whenever we come to the Lord's table, we must realize that we need the covering of His redeeming and cleansing blood
Whenever we come to our altar, the Lord's table, to enjoy and partake of the Lord, we must realize that we need the sprinkling of His blood
Regardless of how good, how nice, how pure, and how clean you consider your flesh, it is still filthy and fallen
Some may say they have been victorious for many months, and during all this time they did not lose their temper once
There are times when we realize that the dear one who is offering Christ as the peace offering to God is rather wild
If in our daily walk we experience Christ in a certain way then surely when we come to the church meeting we will present Christ in that way
If we experience Christ in our daily walk in a mild way, then surely we will present Christ in the meeting in that way
If we experience Christ daily in a wild way, then, of course, we can only present Christ in the meeting in the same way
They bring the Christ whom they experience to their meeting and present Him to God, and this portion is God's food
The meat of the peace offering is for the presenter, and there is also a portion for the presenter to share with all the clean ones
There are some who are just like the common people of Israel, because in the church meeting they do not function
They listen to the message and the testimonies, but they never realize that they must serve in the meeting as a functioning priest
There are a number of brothers and sisters who do put their shoulder under the ark of the meetings of the church
They pray and are burdened for the meetings all day long, and when the time comes for the meeting, they are more and more burdened
When the meeting seems to be going down, they immediately exercise their spirit to pray that the Lord will uplift the meeting
If you are not in the actual priesthood, you are just one among the people, and you miss the right to enjoy the wave breast
Of course, if you are not presently serving, you have no right to enjoy the heave shoulder and the heave cakes
They will be very thankful to the Lord, and they will come to the meeting with a peace offering for thanksgiving
The Lord Jesus told John's disciples to tell John that He did many things for the blind and the lame, but He would not do one thing for him
If we would be offended when the Lord treats us in this way, then we could only offer a peace offering for thanksgiving
If we are here simply for the Lord to do something for us, we can only offer the peace offering of thanksgiving
If we are here for the Lord, with a voluntary vow for His purpose, we do have a strong motive to bring as a peace offering to the meeting
It is really poor to apply what we experienced two months ago, and it is also not good to apply something of yesterday
Deep within, in our spirit, we are cut off already, because we are unclean or we have touched something unclean
We ourselves may be clean, but the Word says that if we touch something unclean or someone unclean, we are defiled
Some brothers and sisters may become involved in fornication, and if we talk to them in detail about all these things, we too become unclean
In 1 Corinthians 5 Paul speaks of six sinful things that make us unclean, and in the next chapter he mentions several unclean things again
He says, 'Such were some of you: but ye are washed in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God'
Many of us were very sinful, but we are washed; we are cleansed by His precious blood, in His mighty name, and by His Spirit
We may have realized that we were not so good and that we had done many wrong things, but we never realized that we are just sin itself
We may think that we are doing a wonderful deed, but eventually we may discover that what we had done was terrible
It says that if the congregation of the Lord's people does something unwittingly, they must offer the sin offering
Later it says that if a ruler among the people does something wrong unwittingly, he must offer the sin offering
By this picture, we can realize that this is a congregation that is worshiping and serving God, which is exactly what we are doing today
We are simply a congregation that worships God by enjoying Christ as our burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering
The priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the veil of the sanctuary
The blood was shed; then the priest brought the blood into the holy place to sprinkle the blood seven times before the veil
After the sprinkling in the presence of God, the priest put some of the blood upon the four horns of the incense altar
We know that the incense altar is in the holy place just before the veil on the other side of which is Gods presence in the Holiest of All
The sprinkling of the blood seven times is for God, but the pouring out of the blood at the bottom of the altar is for the presenter
One is for the priest who did wrong unwittingly, as well as for the whole congregation that did wrong unwittingly
The blood of the sin offering for a ruler or for one of the common people need not be brought into the sanctuary
As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering
These verses tell us clearly that the fat must be burned on the burnt offering altar as a sweet incense to God
The whole body, including the skin, the inwards, and the dung is brought out of the camp to a clean place where the ashes are put
There is a difference in the fat and the rest of the body because the fat is for God's satisfaction; therefore, it was burned on the altar
He is sufficient to meet all the needs of the congregation, and He is more than sufficient to meet the need of individuals
If the sin offering is for individuals, because individuals can never exhaust Christ, there is a part for others to enjoy
The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tent of meeting
You may enjoy Christ by yourself in a certain sense, but you can never enjoy Christ as the sin offering to God
But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken and if it be boiled in a brazen pot it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water
Whether they are brothers or sisters, they are the males among the priests because they are the stronger ones in the church life
As with the other offerings, there are degrees in the appreciation and apprehension of Christ as the sin offering
For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the Holy of Holies by the high priest concerning sin are burned outside the camp
Since Jesus suffered outside the camp, those of us who enjoy Him as the sin offering must also be outside the gate
In all of your experiences as a Christian, how many times have you realized that the Lord Jesus was your sin offering?
A good person may have done little wrong, but he still must confess to God and apply the blood of Christ to himself
By all of these items we can see that the sin offering has the strongest items, and the trespass offering has the weakest
Isaiah 53 also tells how Jesus was made a trespass offering on the cross by God to bear our iniquities, transgressions, and sins
Chapter four speaks only of a priest, the congregation, a ruler, or a common person doing something unwittingly against God
When we are restored we have the release the joy the rest and the peace because sin is dealt with and we are right with God and all others
