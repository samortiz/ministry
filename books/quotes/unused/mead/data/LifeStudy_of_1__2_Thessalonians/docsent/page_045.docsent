   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING WORTHILY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 12 says, "That you should walk worthily of God, Who calls you into His own kingdom and glory."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's calling is according to His selection, and it follows His selection 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As worshippers of idols 1:9 , the believers were in the kingdom of Satan Matt 12:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now, through the salvation in Christ, they are called and have believed into the kingdom of God, which is the sphere for them to worship and enjoy God under the divine ruling with a view of entering into God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's glory goes with His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 12 Paul exhorts the believers to walk worthily of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If he himself had not walked worthily of God, how could he have exhorted others to do so?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this matter also, he set an example for the believers to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 12 indicates that walking worthily of God is related to entering into His kingdom and being ushered into His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The thought here, in contrast to that in verses 1 through 11, is quite deep.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here we have a matter often neglected by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not many believers are taught to have a Christian walk that will enable them to enter into the kingdom of God, a walk that will usher them into God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many Christians have never heard such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless, this is included as part of Paul's teaching to young believers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A GOOD PATTERN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Thessalonians 2:1-12 shows us how we should conduct ourselves as a pattern for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to be a proper pattern, we need to be pure in our motives, especially concerning money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Much of what is written in these verses is related to money, greed, and covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not pure concerning money, if we are not sincere, honest, and faithful regarding it, we may be among those who adulterate the word of God and peddle it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, this motive may cause us to use flattery and to have a pretext for covetousness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All these are serious matters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, if we would be a proper pattern for young saints, our greed must be dealt with, and money matters must be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should never speak words of flattery, we should never have any pretext, and we should never seek glory for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Moreover, instead of trying to please man, we should do our best to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then other believers will have a good pattern to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you consider the situation among believers today, you will realize that many Christians have no sense of direction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The reason for this lack of direction is that they do not have a proper pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to be a pattern to others and foster them, cherishing them as mothers and exhorting them as fathers to walk worthily of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have pointed out in a foregoing message, to walk worthily of God is actually to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only a life that lives God is worthy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we live God, we walk worthily of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a walk will lead us into the kingdom and usher us into the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the goal of God's calling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has called us to enter His kingdom and glory.</S>
