   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUB-SECTION FOUR THYATIRA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2:18-29 VERSE EIGHTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 18:"And to the messenger of the church in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, He who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet are like shining bronze."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now the situation in Thyatira is completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prophetically speaking, Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos are a historical representation of three aspects of the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thyatira also represents one period of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, Thyatira is different from the previous three churches which supersede one another and were raised up consecutively.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thyatira came after Pergamos, yet she remains until this day.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ephesus, Smyrna, and Pergamos have in reality passed away and have become churches in history.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, Thyatira, which comes after Pergamos, does not pass away like the other three churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It remains until the Lord comes back v. 25 . Although after Thyatira there is still Sardis, the church in Sardis does not replace Thyatira or supersede it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the one hand the church in Sardis comes in. On the other hand, the church in Thyatira still remains.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have seen how the church in Ephesus represents the church after the time of the apostles, how Smyrna represents the suffering church after this, and how Pergamos represents the corrupted church that was welcomed by the Roman emperor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Historically, Thyatira represents the Roman Catholic Church in the Middle Ages, which continued until the time of the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the Lord Jesus is revealing Himself as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He reveals His person and His discerning power, how He walks in the midst of the churches, and how He searches man's inward parts and heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In revealing Himself in this way, we can find out the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Ephesus, although there was no apparent failure before men, in the Lord's eyes the first love and the first works were forsaken already.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After this, the Lord detected the teaching of the Nicolaitans in Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Still after this, in Pergamos, the church began openly to be mingled with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church began to live in the world and housed many heresies in it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now in Thyatira we see how the children of Jezebel are allowed to remain in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This gradual apostasy of the church and steady increase in sin are all under the Lord's searching!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In all previous letters, the Lord did not mention His name, but in this letter the Lord mentions His name for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What John saw was the Son of Man, yet here He declares Himself to be the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here, as in His revelation to John in chapter one, He unfolds His own nature.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It mentions here His eyes, which are like a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As such they can search out all sins and can put fear into the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His feet are like shining bronze, which are for His vengeance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything that His eyes condemn will be trampled by His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Here it says that the Lord's feet are as bronze, for bronze is the hardest and strongest of all metals.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Micah 4:13 says: "Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass bronze : and thou shalt beat in pieces many people."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here, unlike in Pergamos, He does not appear as "He who has the sharp two-edged sword."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We know that the sword is God's word of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Himself said, "He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him; the word which I have spoken, that will judge him in the last day" John 12:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In chapter nineteen we see how the sharp sword that comes out of His mouth slays many.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here, however, the word is merely a prophecy of judgment alone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the time of Pergamos, He was still reminding men of this word, warning men of the future judgment, and piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, so that all things are naked and laid bare to the eyes of Him to whom we are accountable Heb 4:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although many have rebelled against God's word in Pergamos, the same word testified against them in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, in Thyatira, there is no more word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What we hear now is just the teaching of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Her disciples consider her words to be from the prophets, clearer and more sure than the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Man considers the word of the church more reliable than the words of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why we do not see the Lord Jesus speaking as the One who has the sharp two-edged sword.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, He reveals Himself as "the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here He is executing His authority and dealing with a church that has raised itself to an inordinate position.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now He is unveiling Himself as God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only He has eyes as a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Besides Him there is no one who has the real holy and clear insight.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Furthermore, only He, the One with feet like shining bronze, is able to execute the overpowering judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Up to this point, He must reveal His own person, because the one who calls herself the bride has contemptuously lowered His status.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church has abused the Lord's humility, grace, and incarnation by putting Him under a human mother.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It reckons that since He is called God, Mary must be "the mother of God."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The teaching of the Roman Catholic Church greatly depreciates the Lord Jesus and ranks Him as one of the many mediators and interceding saints.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The foremost among all these saints is the "queen of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Roman Catholic Church claims that her heart is more compassionate than the heart of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thyatira, the type of the Roman Catholic Church, says that the Lord Jesus is the son of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, the Lord Jesus revealed Himself as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since man has confused the authority of the church with His own authority, He is here revealing His own status as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His eyes are like a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is the church the same as He is?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He has feet like shining bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Does the church have the same?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If what it binds on earth must be bound in heaven, as the Roman Catholic Church claims, can it bind up God's throne just by its command?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Can God's omniscience be compared to the childish babbling of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Can God's holiness be compatible with the church's sins and weaknesses?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although this passage refers specifically to the Roman Catholic Church, we know that the Lord's word is also addressed to all those who champion the authority of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Lord is revealing His own qualifications to those who are uplifting the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He reveals His own qualifications in this way to show others that the church is not qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He alone is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He occupies a position which His people can never attain.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He has a glory which no one else can ever share.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He alone is the Head of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The church is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He deserves to have all the rights to rule over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although He has a very close relationship with the church, the church nevertheless can only remain as the submitting one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is always under Him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the same way that the body submits to the head, the church should submit to the Son of God.</S>
