Yet you realize in the Lord's light of life that you are not that wonderful. You are still full of the self, living in the natural life, and doing things in a natural way always by yourself. You do not trust in the Lord. Every day you need to confess your failure that you do not live Christ, that you do not walk according to spirit (Rom. 8:4). This is a very good practice. Day after day you will learn to practice to walk according to spirit, to practice being one spirit with the Lord. He that is joined to the Lord is one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). We need to confess to the Lord that we are not practically one spirit with Him. We need to ask the Lord to have mercy upon us and grant us the grace that all day long, from morning to evening, we would practice the one spirit with the Lord. As we practice the one spirit with the Lord, we will grow and be transformed for the building up of the Body of Christ. If we would live such a life that practices the one spirit with the Lord and have such a walk that is according to spirit, we would never have a divisive opinion. We would never fight with any brother but would be one with the church. Wherever we would go and wherever we might be, we would be one with the churches, which means that we are built up.</P><P>If all the believers today on this globe would grow, be transformed, and be built up in this way, what a strong testimony of Jesus there would be on this entire earth. If we would live in such a oneness, this would convince the entire world. This is why the Lord prayed, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me" (John 17:21). The situation we see among Christians today, however, is one of endless divisions. We endeavor to preach the gospel to the people of the world, but we may not have much impact. Our preaching may not be powerful because we have lost the testimony. We have missed the oneness. Instead of the expression of the one Body of Christ, there are divisions after divisions. This is why the power is lost and the impact is gone. In the Lord's recovery, the Lord is not concerned with the many works related to the miraculous manifestation of the Spirit. The Lord wants one thing&#151;that we all grow in life and be transformed in life for the building up of the Body of Christ. We should take no other way but this one way to live Christ, to walk according to spirit, to practice the one spirit with the Lord. Then we will grow daily, be transformed daily, and be built up into the one Body. We will be one wherever we go.</P><P>We enjoy the divine oneness by the dispensing of God and for the dispensing of God. When we live in such a oneness, God has an opportunity to dispense Himself more and more into us and more and more into other people. Once we live Christ and practice the one spirit with the Lord, we afford the Lord the best opportunity to dispense Himself to all the people around us, and we will also receive more dispensing of the divine life into ourselves. It is by this way that the church will grow and that the Lord's recovery will increase. Then the Lord will gain the victory, and He will be glorified.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Economy &nbsp; pg 53</div><br></body></html>
