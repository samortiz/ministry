 <h2 class="head1">THE ELDERS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
BEING THE ADMINISTRATORS AMONG GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament God originally ordained for elders, not kings, to be the administrators. God&rsquo;s desire was not that kings would take care of the administration among His people. Hence, the elders need to be careful. None of us should think that if we become an elder, we become a king. Once a person becomes a king, he is through; this is not what God desires. God is not seeking to have kings; rather, He desires to have elders. Among God&rsquo;s people, the elders must represent God to carry out His administration. God&rsquo;s administration cannot be carried out according to the elders&rsquo; view; rather, it must be carried out according to the perpetual law of God, represented by the Ten Commandments in the Old Testament, which are firm and unalterable. In addition, God&rsquo;s administrators must follow His instant, living revelation. Hence, there is not only the perpetual, written law but also living revelation.</p>
<p>The first thing spoken of in the Old Testament in regard to God&rsquo;s administrative arrangement among His people is God&rsquo;s kingdom. As soon as the kingdom and the people of God came into being, there were elders among them. These elders were not appointed in the same way as kings are appointed in a monarchy. The principle for the appointment of elders in the church is that elders must be &ldquo;grown-up and older&rdquo;; hence, it is a matter of life, growth, and maturity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTS IN THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
BEING THOSE WHO BORE GOD&rsquo;S PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy God did not arrange for the elders to come directly into God&rsquo;s presence in the Holy of Holies; rather, He wonderfully arranged for there to be another group of people&mdash;the priesthood. In the priesthood there was a high priest who, according to God&rsquo;s Old Testament economy, entered into the Holy of Holies once a year to draw near to God. When the high priest entered the Holy of Holies, he wore two kinds of plates. One kind was the shoulder plates upon which were two onyx stones engraved with the names of the sons of Israel; six names were engraved on the one stone and six names were engraved on the other stone (Exo. 28:9-10). This indicates that the high priest should bear God&rsquo;s people on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The high priest also wore another kind of plate, the breastplate, which hung upon the high priest&rsquo;s garment. The garments of the high priest were very special. The most important garment was the ephod, which was similar to a vest. Bible translators have found it difficult to express this word with an equivalent in their own language; as a result, they simply transliterate the Hebrew word (v. 4). The ephod was a long vest worn over the robe of the priests. The ephod was attached to the breastplate, on which were twelve precious stones, each representing a tribe of Israel. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel were engraved on the twelve precious stones. These names contained only eighteen of the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Thus, according to the Hebrew alphabet, there was still a shortage of four letters. Hence, God instructed Moses to add another object&mdash;the Thummim, which means &ldquo;perfecters, completers&rdquo; (v. 30).</p>
<p>When this object was added, the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet were complete. The breastplate was similar to a typewriter. An English typewriter contains keys for the twenty-six letters of the English alphabet, and the combination of these letters is unlimited. They can be combined to form words, sentences, and even a composition. The breastplate was a spiritual typewriter worn on the breast of the high priest. Its being worn on the breast signifies care. The high priest cared for God&rsquo;s people and carried them with him. The high priest needed to put the Urim and the Thummim in the breastplate (v. 30; Lev. 8:8). Some versions indicate that the Urim was a kind of illuminator and that the Thummim was an object upon which were inscribed four letters of the Hebrew alphabet.</p>
<p>When a problem arose among the children of Israel that could not be solved according to the Ten Commandments, the high priest would bring the breastplate before God to inquire of Him. In the process of inquiring, one of the letters or one of the names of the tribes would suddenly become dark. This can be likened to the telegraph, in which a message is sent letter by letter until eventually the entire sentence can be read. The breastplate along with the Urim and the Thummim were the Old Testament &ldquo;telegraph.&rdquo; Hence, the breastplate of the high priest was called the breastplate of judgment (Exo. 28:29). When there was a problem among God&rsquo;s people, the high priest would receive a judgment from God by means of the breastplate and the Urim and the Thummim.</p>
