   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AND SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the previous message I indicated first that in order to speak for God, prayer is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, I said that to speak for God also requires the filling of the Holy Spirit, which is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have already mentioned that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, or the filling of the Holy Spirit, is a matter accomplished by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the last of the seven great accomplishments of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have believed in the Lord, and we all have faith; therefore, we need to enjoy these seven great accomplishments of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have been speaking for the Lord for more than fifty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I cannot say that every time I speak for the Lord I am filled with the Holy Spirit or have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but I can tell you that many times I knew that indeed I had the filling of the Holy Spirit; this was undeniable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not pay much attention to outward miracles; however, in the past when I spoke for the Lord, such things as miracles and wonders did occur.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, we do not like to emphasize these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all should realize that the Lord in whom we believe is the Lord who accomplished these seven great items: as God He was incarnated; He passed through human living; His all-inclusive death solved all our problems; He was resurrected, and He caused us to be resurrected together with Him in order that we might be regenerated; then He became the life-giving Spirit and breathed Himself into us; He ascended to the height and was made both Lord and Christ; and as the outpoured Spirit, who is also the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit, He poured Himself upon us, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today, the One in whom we believe is such a Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Let us enjoy all that He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When you exercise to speak the word of God to others, you must believe that you have the Spirit within you and that you also have the Spirit upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have the Spirit of life, the essential Spirit, within you and the Spirit of power, the economical Spirit, upon you.</S>
