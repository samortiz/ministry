[1]  The Divine Trinity as Revealed in the Holy Word CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN GENESIS Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1-3, 26-27; 3:22; 6:3; 11:6-8; 18:1-2; 16:10; 21:17-18; 22:11-12; 31:11-13; 48:15-16 NEEDING TO SEE
[3]  I studied all the traditional teachings when I was young, but I eventually began to see certain points concerning the Divine Trinity that are directly according to the revelation of the pure Word of God.
[4]  THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN GENESIS In the Beginning God Created
[5]  There are at least twelve instances in Genesis that indicate or imply the Trinity.
[6]  The plural subject, God, implies the three of the Godhead, and the singular predicate, created, implies the one God.
[7]  This verse reveals that God s intention and goal in creating the heavens and the earth were to have a man with a spirit so that man may possess Him and enjoy Him and so that God may work Himself into man to fulfill His eternal plan.
[8]  God s aspect of being singular yet plural is also shown in Genesis 1:26-27, which says, God said, Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness;...God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.
[9]  Jehovah God Said, Behold, the Man Has Become like One of Us, Knowing Good and Evil;
[10]  Genesis 3:22 says, Jehovah God said, Behold, the man has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever.
[11]  This implication of the Trinity is in relation to man s eating of the tree of life to take God in as man s life.
[12]  Genesis 21:17-18 says, The Angel of God Elohim called to Hagar out of heaven and said to her...God has heard the voice of the boy where he is.
[13]  CHAPTER TWO THE DIVINE TRINITY AS REVEALED IN EXODUS 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 3:2, 4, 6-7, 14-15
[14]  In Genesis 48:15-16 Jacob said, The God who has shepherded me all my life to this day, / The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the boys.
[15]  Exodus stresses two matters concerning the Trinity: the Angel of God, or the Angel of Jehovah, and the Spirit of God.
[16]  One who is sent to us may come to us but not enter into us, but the Spirit comes from God to reach us not only objectively but also subjectively by entering into us.
[17]  As the I AM, Christ is everything He is the Angel of Jehovah, Elohim, God the Father, God the Son, God the Spirit, our Provider, our Healer, the Warrior who triumphs over all our enemies, our peace, our Shepherd, our righteousness, and the One who is present for our enjoyment.
[18]  Prayer: Lord, we love You, and we love Your word.
[19]  Exodus 14:19-20 says, The Angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved from before them and stood behind them.
[20]  The Angel of God, the Pillar of Cloud, and Jehovah, as the Divine Trinity,
[21]  The Angel of God, the pillar of cloud, and Jehovah, as the Divine Trinity, protected God s redeemed people and fought their enemies for them for the purpose of bringing the redeemed into the enjoyment of the Triune God.
[22]  We may wonder why God did not do things as Himself directly but was complicated by doing things as the Angel of God and the pillar of cloud.
[23]  The lampstand as God s embodiment Christ the Son , gold as God s nature the Father , and the seven lamps as God s expression the sevenfold Spirit signify the Divine Trinity and show that the Triune God is consummated as the sevenfold intensified Spirit to shine out the Triune God as light into us Rev 4:5; 5:6 .
[24]  The Triune God was processed to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit for the purpose that the Triune God in His ultimate expression may impart His divine element with all the processes He went through, including incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection, into His redeemed people, making them one with Him.
[25]  Prayer: Lord, we take You as our sin offering and trespass offering.
[26]  Mount Sinai was not only where the Old Testament law was decreed; more importantly, the children of Israel were brought into the presence of God at Mount Sinai Exo 19:11 through sanctification v. 10 and in resurrection v. 11 to hear the speaking of God v. 9 . Furthermore, in fellowship with God they were brought into the knowledge of God to know the grace of God v. 4 and the holiness of God vv.
[27]  Exodus 33:2-5 says, I Jehovah will send an Angel before you...Jehovah had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff-necked people; if I were to go up in your midst for one moment, I would consume you.
[28]  Exodus 34:5-10 says, Jehovah descended in the cloud and took His place there with him Moses and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.
[29]  Then Jehovah passed by before him and proclaimed, Jehovah, Jehovah, God compassionate and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in lovingkindness and truth, keeping lovingkindness with thousands of generations, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; but He will by no means clear the guilty, but visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the grandchildren, to the third and fourth generations.
[30]  The merciful and governmental God and the rebellious, stiff-necked people can be brought together only through the Angel, the pillar of cloud, the cleft rock, and the hand of Jehovah, which typify Christ as God s sent One, the pneumatic Christ, Christ in His death, and Christ as the covering in God s manifestation.
[31]  At the end of Exodus we see a profound and wonderful picture of the Divine Trinity.
[32]  Most readers of the Bible probably do not consider that there is a picture of the Trinity in this brief portion of the holy Word.
[33]  The anointing oil used to anoint the tabernacle in Exodus 40:9 typifies God the Spirit compounded with the Triune God, Christ s humanity, Christ s death with its effectiveness, and Christ s resurrection with its power.
[34]  The one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God, and the four spices signify Christ s humanity, since the number four denotes God s creatures Ezek.
[35]  The Triune God was embodied in Christ as the tabernacle for the purpose of dispensing Himself into His redeemed people for their enjoyment of all the riches of His being.
[36]  The tabernacle and the offerings, which also typify Christ, show that the Triune God mingles Himself with His people to dispense all the riches of His being into them for their enjoyment and their portion as their eternal inheritance so that they might become His enjoyment and His portion as His inheritance for eternity.
[37]  The footnote for the phrase designated as an inheritance says, On the one hand, we have become God s inheritance v. 18 for God s enjoyment; on the other hand, we inherit God as our inheritance v. 14 for our enjoyment.
[38]  Through this picture we see the Triune God s mingling with and dispensing of Himself into His redeemed for their enjoyment and their portion as their inheritance, which causes them to became God s enjoyment and portion as His inheritance for eternity.
[39]  AS REVEALED IN LEVITICUS 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 1:3, 8-9; 2:1-2; 3:1-3, 11; 7:11-12; 4:3-6; 5:6-7
[40]  In this chapter we will consider the Divine Trinity as revealed in the types of the five basic offerings in the first part of Leviticus.
[41]  Although I began to study Leviticus decades ago, I did not realize until recently how much of the Divine Trinity is revealed and applied to us in the types of the offerings.
[42]  It is difficult to understand how Christ could be God s food, since Christ as the Son is part of the Triune God.
[43]  Leviticus 2:1-2 says, When anyone presents an offering of a meal offering to Jehovah, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it and put frankincense on it.
[44]  Christ as a man with all His perfect and complete virtues is food to God and to those who serve God.
[45]  As in the types of the other offerings, Jehovah is God the Father as the Receiver of the offerings, the Tent of Meeting typifies Christ the Son as the place of offering, the priest typifies Christ the Son as the serving One, and the fire typifies God as the accepting agent.
[46]  In this case, the sin offering signifies Christ the Son as an offering for our sin to deal with the source of our sins, and the burnt offering signifies Christ the Son as the offering for God s satisfaction to deal with the cause of our sins.
[47]  AS REVEALED IN LEVITICUS 2 Scripture Reading: Lev 8:2, 12, 14, 18, 26, 30-31; 9:23-24; 14:4-5, 10, 12, 17-19; 24:2-4
[48]  Prayer: Lord, we need Your blood to cleanse us, and we need Your Spirit to anoint us.
[49]  Exodus reveals the redemption of fallen man, consummating in the tabernacle, which was God s dwelling among His redeemed for God to fully give Himself to them and for them to enter into Him to enjoy Him in full.
[50]  Then Leviticus continues to show us how God s redeemed people can enjoy God in fellowship through the offerings in the Tent of Meeting.
[51]  The bird that was killed signifies the crucified Christ, and the bird that was released signifies the resurrected Christ v. 7 . The cleansing of our sinful condition requires the crucified Christ with His shed blood and the resurrected Christ with His resurrection life.
[52]  This indicates that we have trespasses because we do not hear the word of God properly, we do not do things according to God s will, and we do not walk in the ways of God.
[53]  AS REVEALED IN NUMBERS Scripture Reading: Num 6:13-16, 22-27; 7:1, 11-17; 9:15-18, 21; 20:6-8
[54]  Prayer: Lord, we believe that the reality of the Divine Trinity is with us.
[55]  Numbers 6:22-27 says, Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying, Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, Thus you shall bless the children of Israel; you shall say to them, Jehovah bless you and keep you; Jehovah make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you; Jehovah lift up His countenance upon you and give you peace.
[56]  The cloud and the fire covering the tabernacle indicate that the Divine Trinity is for God s people to stay or to journey that they may enjoy the riches of the Divine Trinity all the time and all the way.
[57]  The intrinsic reality of the record in Numbers is the Divine Trinity, as revealed in the separation of the Nazarite, Jehovah s threefold blessing to His people, the function of the tabernacle and the altar, God s continual presence with His people in their journey, and the thirst-quenching rock that followed them as they followed God.
[58]  After God s people received their respective portions of the good land to enjoy, in Judges we see that they did not keep Moses exhortation to live according to God s law and ordinances so that they might please God.
[59]  The Divine Trinity s involvement in Deborah s victory over Sisera, the captain of the Canaanite army, was for her and her followers to enjoy the Triune God.
[60]  Judges 13:3-25 says, The Angel of Jehovah appeared to the woman...Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me; and His appearance was like the appearance of an angel of God...Then Manoah entreated Jehovah and said, Oh, my Lord!
[61]  Let the man of God, whom You sent, come again to us, I pray; and let Him teach us what we should do with the boy that is to be born...And the Angel of God came again to the woman...And the woman hurried and ran off; and she told her husband and said to him, The man who came to me that day has just appeared to me.
[62]  The kid that Manoah offered typifies Christ as the burnt offering for God s satisfaction, and the meal offering typifies Christ for God s food.
[63]  AS REVEALED IN 1 AND 2 SAMUEL Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 1:3-5, 7, 10-11, 20, 24; 19:20, 23; 2 Sam 22:1-3, 47; 23:1-3; 24:25; 1 Sam 10:1, 6-10; 11:6; 16:1-3, 13
[64]  In order for God s chosen people to be His house, His expression, the Trinity was needed.
[65]  However, God s purpose for His people was not merely to defeat the enemies and take full possession of the land but for them to set up a kingdom.
[66]  From his childhood Samuel was a Nazarite, serving as a priest in the house of God v. 24; 2:11, 18 . While Samuel was staying with Eli in the temple, God appeared in a vision to Samuel 3:4-14 . Samuel was still a boy, just as the Lord Jesus was when He went to Jerusalem with His parents Luke 2:42 . Eventually, Samuel became a renowned prophet and the judge of Israel 1 Sam 3:20; 7:6 . However, for Samuel to be a priest, a prophet, and a judge was not God s goal.
[67]  Our present situation and God s need today are the same in principle as the situation and the need at the time of Samuel.
[68]  Some today need to pray according to God s need, as Hannah did.
[69]  Samuel was the last judge because God used him to terminate the confused situation among God s people, who were without a king or a kingdom.
[70]  In this portion of the Word we can see that the Triune God with His embodiment and redemption was fully involved in bringing forth Samuel and David so that the kingdom of God might be brought in. To bring in the kingdom of God is a great thing.
[71]  First Samuel 10:1 says, Samuel took the vial of oil and poured it upon his Saul s head...and said, Jehovah anoints you ruler over His inheritance.
[72]  Oil here typifies the Spirit of God, and Jehovah is the eternal One.
[73]  Verses 6 through 10 say, The Spirit of Jehovah will rush upon you; and you will prophesy with them and be turned into another man...For God is with you...I will come down to you to offer up burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings...God gave him Saul another heart...And when they came there to the hill, there was the group of prophets, coming to meet him.
[74]  As in the previous verses, the Spirit of Jehovah is the third of the Trinity reaching man, and God in Hebrew is Elohim, the Triune God.
[75]  Similarly, the burnt offerings typify Christ for God s satisfaction, and the peace offerings typify Christ for the peace between God and His people.
