To prophesy is to speak for the Lord, and in our speaking for the Lord, we have to speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into others. To prophesy is to dispense the very Christ whom we have experienced into others.<sup>143</sup> [That it does not denote foretelling or predicting] is proven by the words building up, encouragement, and consolation in verse 3; by the words convicted and examined in verse 24; and by the words all may learn and all may be encouraged in verse 31. Speaking the Lord into people builds them up, encourages them, and consoles them. When we speak for the Lord, others are convicted and judged. The fact that all may learn and all may be encouraged also shows that this is not predicting but speaking for the Lord.<sup>144</sup></p><p>The apostle Paul taught that we all can prophesy (1 Cor. 14:31).<sup>145</sup> This verse is one of the clearest verses in the entire Bible. It says that all the believers have the capacity to prophesy. Capacity denotes an ability by birth....[Nevertheless], many saints among us may feel that all can prophesy except them. However, there are no exceptions. We may not be eloquent, but we can still prophesy....The Lord wants all of us to speak.<sup>146</sup> To build up the organic Body of Christ, all of us need to speak.<sup>147</sup></p><p>In order to prophesy, there are a few things which are indispensable. First, we must love the Lord and have fellowship with Him. We must live before the Lord and be a person who is joined to Him as one. Second, we must spend the effort to learn the truth. We need to read much of the Bible and the spiritual publications....Third, we must be flexible, walking according to the Spirit, and receiving instant and fresh inspiration all the time. Fourth, we should learn to have a heavenly, enlarged view, to know Christ and the church, and not to have our own opinions or view, but to have the view of God....Fifth, we should be prepared to prophesy in our daily life.<sup>148</sup></p><h2 class="head1">The Consciousness of the Body</h2><p>In the church life, we should learn to have the consciousness of the Body....Some Christians are like butterflies; they act independently. Others are like bees; they live and move together. The butterfly flies from flower to flower, going its own sweet way; but the bee works for the hive. The butterfly lives and works individually, but the bee has a body-consciousness. We should all be like bees, having the consciousness of the Body so that we can live together with other members in the Body of Christ. Wherever there is Body-revelation, there is Body-consciousness, and wherever there is Body-consciousness, individual thought and action are automatically ruled out. Seeing Christ results in deliverance from sin; seeing the Body results in deliverance from individualism....It is not a matter of changing our attitude or conduct; revelation does the work. We cannot enter the realm of the Body by anything other than seeing. A real inward seeing settles the whole problem.<sup>149</sup></p><p>The real significance is that we have become the members of the Body of Christ, possessing the same one life and needing one another....Therefore, whatever we do must be in the Body, joined to the Body, and regulated by the Body, because we are one Body.<sup>150</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
