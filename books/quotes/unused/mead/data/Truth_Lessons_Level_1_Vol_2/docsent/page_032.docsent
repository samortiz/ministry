   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HIS CONCEPTION A. Conceived of the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Born of a Virgin</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This wonderful person, Jesus Christ, was conceived of the Holy Spirit of God in the womb of a chaste virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His source was on the one hand God and on the other hand man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the biblical sense, the Holy Spirit of God is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, His being conceived of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a chaste virgin was the coming of God Himself into this chaste virgin to be conceived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Surely this conception had the two elements of God and man; with the Holy Spirit there was the element of God, and with the virgin there was the element of man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the result of this conception was that a God-man was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. With God and Man as His Essences</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus Christ was born with two natures, the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has not only the divine nature but also the human nature; He has both natures, divinity and humanity, at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word nature not only indicates His nature, but even more it denotes His essence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The essences of Jesus Christ are His two natures: the divine and the human.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is a God-man, One who is constituted with the divine nature and the human nature, that is, the divine essence plus the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, He is both the complete God and the perfect Man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As God, He is completely God; as man, He is really a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is a God-man, a mingling of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Any conception is a mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the conception of Jesus Christ there were two essences, the divine essence and the human essence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The two essences were not only added together; they were mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, what was produced was a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>HIS BIRTH A. In the Reign of Caesar Augustus</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Luke 2:1-3 says, Now it came about in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for all the inhabited earth to be enrolled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This first enrollment took place when Quirinius governed Syria.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was sovereign of God that such a decree was issued during the reign of Caesar Augustus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By this enrollment Mary and Joseph were brought from Nazareth to Bethlehem so that Christ might be born there for the fulfillment of the prophecy in the Old Testament Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Luke 2:4-5 says, And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to David s city, which is called Bethlehem, because he was out of the house and family of David, to be enrolled with Mary, who was espoused to him and was pregnant.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apart from the decree of Caesar Augustus, it might not have been possible for Mary and Joseph to go from Nazareth to Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a move was necessary for the fulfillment of the prophecy that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>B. At Bethlehem</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Micah 5:2 prophesied clearly that Christ was to be born in Bethlehem of Judea; then, in due time, under God s sovereign arrangement and leading, Christ was born there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew recorded this particular prophecy which was omitted in the other three Gospels , especially to prove that the child Jesus was born a descendant of David to be the legal heir to his throne.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>C. Laid in a Manger</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Luke 2:7 says, And she gave birth to her son, the firstborn; and she wrapped Him in cloths and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The life of the Lord Jesus began with a manger, in the lowliest estate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Due to the occupancy of the busy activities of fallen mankind, there was no room for Him in the inn, so that He had to be laid in a manger.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may say that the manger is a symbol of His human living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>D. Announced to the Shepherds by an Angel</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There were shepherds in Bethlehem, living in the fields and keeping the nightwatches over their flock.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And an angel of the Lord stood by them and said to them, I bring you good news of great joy, which will be to all the people, because a Savior was born to you today in David s city, who is Christ the Lord Luke 2:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This good news of great joy was announced to all people, not only to the Jewish people but to all of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The angel went on to say, And this is the sign to you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger Luke 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A baby in a manger, signifying smallness in lowliness, was a sign of the Lord s life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nevertheless, this little baby was the mighty God Isa 9:6 .</S>
