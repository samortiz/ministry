   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Concerning Sisters Who Need</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Care for Their Families</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another situation involves sisters who are zealous for the Lord but do not care for family matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They do not adequately care for their husbands or for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A sister in Peiping, whose husband was a university professor, went everywhere serving the Lord zealously.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every day she went to visit the saints early in the morning, neglecting her housework and her children.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She did not return home until evening.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As a result, her husband came to the meeting hall and complained about her, saying, What are you doing in this church?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not have a wife anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This sister felt that her husband and children could take care of their needs without her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How could such a sister be approved to serve the Lord full time?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Instead of approving her, we recommended that she return home to be a full-time wife.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When she could be a proper wife at home, she could serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1938 there was a sister in Chefoo who was so zealous in serving full time that she did not even stop to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She said that when she ate, she wasted the time she could spend praying.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She wanted to pray all the time, even at the expense of eating and sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She justified herself by saying that the Bible tells us to pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She would not listen to any exhortations, and this hindered her service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This type of abnormal service is at best short-lived.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The churches must consider such situations when they approve the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Having a Good Reputation before Others</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Paul says, We exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men 2 Cor 8:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a person wants to serve full time, we must pay attention to his reputation in the church and before men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a brother who serves the Lord does not have a good reputation outside the church, we must exhort him to correct the matter that caused him to have a poor reputation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He must learn how to be a proper person before he can serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some brothers and sisters are not improper in their behavior, but they love to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When such a person arrives at a meeting, he does not stop talking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He speaks in every meeting, and every time he speaks, he speaks for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even if the elders ask him to stop speaking, he does not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such saints might turn in consecration slips and desire to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we want to approve them, we must find an opportunity to fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The localities must consider these situations when approving the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We hope that the saints who give their time to serve, both those who will serve full time and those who will serve part time, will be useful and not be a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, the churches must approve them according to these principles.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By so doing, we will be able to confirm whether a saint should serve full time or part time in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>NOT MAKING THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A SPECIAL CLASS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must not consider the full-time or part-time serving ones to be a special class.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do, we will fall into a religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After 1952 we had more than one hundred full-time serving ones in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In mainland China we did not use the expression full-time serving one very often.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We used the term co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Taiwan the term full-time serving one became so prevalent that the full-time serving ones were considered a special class of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Strictly speaking, we are all full-time serving ones because we are for the Lord whether we die or we live.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Nee once said that serving the Lord is our primary profession and that our job is our secondary profession.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every one of us is a full-time serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It does not matter whether we are students, teachers, doctors, nurses, or even housewives who take care of their children; we are all for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our goal is to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>From this viewpoint, we are all full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>ASSIGNING WORK TO THE FULL-TIME SERVING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Assigning work to the full-time serving ones will depend on the practical situation in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whether the full-time serving ones preach the gospel on the campuses, in the homes, or in the community, or whether they coordinate with the children s work, it will depend on the situation in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christianity is an organized religion, and the assignments in Christianity are often made by a centralized committee.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We cannot take that way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Concerning the support to the full-time serving ones, we do not want to set up a centralized financial unit in the work that would collect offerings and distribute them to the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The local churches must take care of the matter of supplying the needs of their full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Neither do we want to touch the matter of assigning duties to the full-time serving ones in a centralized way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, we should let every local church make its own assignments.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The leading that we see in the Bible does not come from a centralized authority but from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must avoid division in the move of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, if an arm becomes separated from the body, it is a division.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Such division is a damage to the body and makes the arm completely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This applies to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In order to avoid centralization and division, we must have much fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Suppose there are many full-time serving ones in the church in Taichung.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After they are approved and assigned to the work, the leading brothers might discover that they do not need so many serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then the leading brothers should fellowship with the other churches.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If, for example, there are not enough full-time serving ones in the church in Taipei, the church in Taichung and the church in Taipei can balance the needs through fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should not forget that in our natural man, we are all like politicians who set their heart to grasp power and rule over others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If twenty sisters come to clean the meeting hall, there will be problems.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First, everyone wants to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Second, whoever is the leader expects the other nineteen sisters to submit to her.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the elders say that four sisters should take the lead in cleaning four areas of the meeting hall, each of the four sisters will want the rest of the sisters to serve in her group.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is an example of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should not think that only people in government play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There can be politics even in the matters of sweeping the floor and washing the windows in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>After the elders assign some young full-time serving ones to the children s work, some to work with the junior high school students, and some to work on the universities, these serving ones may recruit others to serve with them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Such recruiting will result in disputes.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This kind of political disposition is in every one of us, and we must do our best to avoid it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should not think that the full-time serving ones produced by a church should necessarily stay in that church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Neither should we think that a church that produces only a few full-time serving ones is deserving of its lack.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Someone who cannot cook should not be forced to go hungry if others have food.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, it is easy to want extra glory for our locality, even if other localities are suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This kind of attitude is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All those who love the Lord and His recovery must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must see that God does not want politics.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must eliminate politics.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The churches must get rid of politics, and every one of us must get rid of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When a young brother begins to serve full time, he consecrates himself to the Lord and to His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The locality that nurtured him should not hold on to him.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>His placement in the work should be decided in the fellowship of the Body and according to the Lord s leading within him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>There is no organization among us, nor is there a pope among us to give commands as to who must go to a certain place or who must stay in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Such a practice is the way of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The local churches must not have disputes concerning full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Whether there is an excess or a lack is in the Lord s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We have been serving for many years and have seen many situations.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We can testify that those who tried to keep some extra glory in their locality found that it did not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The serving ones whom they vie for are like the night-blooming cereus flowers that bloom only at midnight and wilt before dawn.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should not fight to have any flowers for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Even if we have many flowers, they are like the night-blooming cereus flowers that fade and wilt in a very short time.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>There may be a certain local church that does not seem to be doing well.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>However, even though this locality may struggle for eight or ten years, heavenly grace will eventually fall upon it, and it will rise up to become a very living local church.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We must believe that our future is bright and that all the local churches are promising and living.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>All the serving ones must have a broad view to see that we are serving the Head of the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The church refers to the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We should not care only for the church in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>It is good if the effect of our service helps our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>It is also good if our service helps another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Everything is for the Lord and in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Taiwan is a small island.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We must not get stuck in our small well.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The localities should fellowship with one another and the full-time serving ones and the part-time serving ones should fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Everyone should seek the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>With such a practice it will be easy to assign work to the full-time serving ones.</S>
