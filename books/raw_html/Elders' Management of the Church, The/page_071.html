<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Be Open</H2><P>All those who do not open themselves to the brothers are keeping themselves whole. As such, it is impossible for them to coordinate. Many problems result from a lack of openness, the most serious of which is misunderstanding. If you never open up yourself or share your feeling with others, but you hold on to what you consider as right, misunderstanding and misinterpretation will very easily result. This misunderstanding is the enemy's most serious weapon to destroy coordination. I know of some places where elders cannot be coordinated together simply because of misunderstanding. Wherever misunderstanding occurs and exists, coordination is finished. Everyone may still be able to come together for talks and discussions, but it will be of no avail, because the germ of misunderstanding has killed the life of coordination.</P><P>Openness can solve many problems. Sometimes there are problems among the brothers. Do not avoid the problems; rather face them head on. Suppose you avoid the problem, and I avoid the problem; the more we avoid it, the closer we will become, and the closer we become, the more misunderstanding there will be. This is only the problem on the negative side. On the positive side, a person who is not open cannot supply others with grace and life, and cannot receive others' supply. This is because there is no flow between you and others; what is in you cannot flow out, and what is in others cannot flow into you. Hence, in order to coordinate together, everyone must be open.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Humble yet Not Passive</H2><P>In order to coordinate together well, the elders need to be humble and not be passive. I may be a very humble person. Yet at the same time I am very positive. When a person is humble, it is easy for him to be passive. But when a person is positive, it is not easy for him to be humble. This is common human nature. But in the coordination, we have to learn to be humble without being passive. I have to touch everything, and I want to participate in everything. I have my view in everything, and I am happy to express my feeling in everything. Yet I remain humble. This humility with this positiveness is a difficult lesson to learn. It is not easy for those who are positive to be humble, and it is not easy for those who are humble to be positive. In order to be humble as well as positive, there is the need for grace and for brokenness.</P>
