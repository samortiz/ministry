We have to submit to the careful arrangement of the older, leading brothers who make decisions under the control of the Holy Spirit. These brothers should also give clear advice concerning proper occupations. We want all the consecrated ones to be able to work together, even for the gospel migration. In the past our occupation was for our personal interest and livelihood. In the future we hope that we will offer up our occupation to God for the accomplishment of His gospel. We hope that we can say that any occupation is acceptable as long as it benefits the gospel. We have no choice of our own. We do not want to take our own way. Rather, we will go where the gospel goes. If we can do this, we can send some to Sinkiang province or to Tibet. If the whole church can send out five thousand, ten thousand, or even fifty thousand people, how much the Lord will bless His church! If everything we have is offered up for the gospel, the church, and the Lord's service, the Lord and the gospel will have a free way through the church.</p><p>Brother Liu was a very good doctor. He and his wife were sent to Yi-Yang. They had a good place to live in Chung-Shan Hospital. When they arrived in Yi-Yang none of the walls of the saints' houses were made of solid material. They did not even have tiled roofs; many lived in tents. Brother Liu and his wife did the same. They did not have their own choice. His job at Chung-Shan Hospital was not bad, but for the sake of serving God, they chose to live in these unbearable conditions. Thousands of people throughout church history have forsaken everything for the sake of serving the Lord. Brother Liu and his wife gave up their good living and moved to Yi-Yang for one purpose only&mdash;to join the other brothers and sisters in serving our God.</p><h2 class="head1">FORSAKING EVERYTHING TO SERVE OUR GOD</h2><p>I hope that no one in Hong Kong will hold back anything. I hope that everyone will be absolute and forsake everything to serve our God. We must be this kind of people before God will allow us to serve Him. We have to be clear about what we are doing here. I do not believe there is another force as powerful in preaching the gospel as the whole Body rising up. Yet there are not many places where men dare to say that they will forsake everything to serve our God. Actually, no one wants to say such a thing. A man is willing to say such a word only after God has worked on him and dealt with him. Brother Witness, Sister Wang, and myself have considered this matter for many years. We dared not say this word because we felt that we had not been dealt with enough. Today we have not lost our sanity when we say such a word. The Lord has brought us to a point that we cannot hold back this word. We have to realize that we have to bear the responsibility for what we are saying here. Indeed, this is not something that we love to speak in ourselves. I know the consequence of saying such a thing. But this is the only way we can serve our God. No cheaper way will work. Let me say this again: Only those who have forsaken everything can serve our God. I know the serious responsibility I am bearing for saying such a word. Perhaps you would rather be a spectator in this meeting, but we have to fulfill our responsibility. I can only say what Paul said to Agrippa when he testified that he was not insane. He had not lost his mind. This is the way that God has put in front of us.</p><p>If we take the way God has laid before us, the glorious church in Ephesians 4 and 5 will be before our eyes. May God open our eyes, and may such a glorious day be hastened through our absoluteness.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYERS</h2><p>Brother Weigh: Lord, in Hong Kong everything is loose, but everyone has a tight grip on mammon. Everyone is building up his Babylon and Jericho. These are the things the world boasts of. But You will destroy them all. How easy it is for us to follow the world. Unless You deal with all these things by Your mighty power, Your great glory, and Your love, we will have no way to go on. Lord, grant us the grace to willingly destroy what we have built and to give ourselves to You entirely for Your service.</p><p>A sister: Lord, apart from the cleansing of Your blood, no one can be accepted by You. Unless we consecrate ourselves absolutely to You, we are not qualified to serve You. May Your glorious face on the throne attract us once more so that we can run after You.</p><p>Brother Luk: Lord, grant us a persevering faithfulness. We want to put this word into practice immediately. We do not want to have any compromise from our head to our very toes.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Lord, do a work in Hong Kong as You have never done before. Clear out the situation here entirely. We want to give ourselves to You unconditionally and gloriously. We desire to consecrate ourselves to You absolutely and thoroughly. In the past we built up many things for ourselves. Work in us today to destroy them all. Clear out everything until nothing is left. Work on us again and again. Have a way among us and then have a way here in Hong Kong. May we see the whole Body rising up to serve in Hong Kong, and may many other places follow in its footsteps. We consecrate ourselves to You. We offer ourselves to You so that You will have a way to go on in the church. When You have a way to go on in the church, the gospel will have a way to go on in Hong Kong. Be merciful to us and be gracious to us. Send us the heavenly fire. Accept our offering so that Your gospel will have a free way among us. Amen.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
