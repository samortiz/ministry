<h1 class="title">Living a Crucified Life<br />
for the Manifestation of the Resurrection Life<br />
by the Excellent Power of the Treasure<br />
in the Earthen Vessels</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 4:7-18</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Second Corinthians 3 and 4 are an accurate and precious record of Paul&rsquo;s spiritual constitution:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>What the apostles ministered was their constitution; they ministered what they were, what they had become&mdash;cf. Phil. 1:20-21a.</li>
	<li>This means that their reconstituted being became their ministry&mdash;cf. Acts 20:18.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The indwelling Christ as the treasure in us, the earthen vessels, is the divine source of the supply for the Christian life and the excellent power for us to live a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life&mdash;2 Cor. 4:7; Phil. 4:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Paul said that he and his co-workers &ldquo;were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living...that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 1:8-9.</li>
	<li>Actually, resurrection requires death, discouragement, and disappointment in order to be manifested&mdash;v. 4; 7:5-6.</li>
	<li>The working of the cross terminates our self that we may enjoy the God of resurrection; such experience produces and forms the ministry&mdash;1:4-6.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The apostles lived the resurrection life under the killing of the cross, for the carrying out of their ministry:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body&rdquo;&mdash;4:10:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Jesus, in a positive sense, is always killing all the negative things within us in order to heal and enliven us&mdash;Phil 1:19; cf. Exo. 30:23-25.</li>
		<li>When we reject ourselves in the morning to receive God into us, we have the sense during the day that a killing process is going on within us&mdash;cf. Prov. 4:18.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus&rsquo; sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:11:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The killing of the cross results in the manifestation of the resurrection life; this daily killing is for the release of the divine life in resurrection&mdash;1 Cor. 15:31; 2 Cor. 4:16.</li>
		<li>The title <em>Jesus</em> implies that the apostles lived a life like the one the Lord Jesus lived on earth; the Lord&rsquo;s life was a life under the killing of the cross for the manifestation of the resurrection life, a life lived in such a way that His person was one with His ministry and His life was His ministry&mdash;John 6:14-15; 12:13, 19, 23-24.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>&ldquo;So then death operates in us, but life in you&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>When we are under the killing of the Lord&rsquo;s death, His resurrection life is imparted through us into others&mdash;cf. Josh. 3:17.</li>
		<li>The way for the church to come into being and to increase is not by human glory; it is by the death of the cross for the release of the fire of the divine life&mdash;Luke 12:49-50; John 2:19; 12:24-26:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord, as a grain of wheat that fell into the ground, lost His soul-life through death that He might release His eternal life in resurrection to the many grains.</li>
			<li>As the many grains, we also must lose our soul-life through death that we may enjoy eternal life in resurrection.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>It is by the spirit of faith that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for the carrying out of their ministry&mdash;2 Cor. 4:13; 5:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must exercise our mingled spirit, the spirit of faith, to believe and to speak, like the psalmist (Psa. 116:10a), the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection.</li>
	<li>Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind; doubts are in our mind&mdash;cf. Heb. 11:6.</li>
	<li>Through the exercise of our spirit of faith, we regard the unseen things of eternal glory, not the seen things of temporary affliction&mdash;2 Cor. 4:18:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Christian life is a life of things unseen&mdash;Heb. 11:1.</li>
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover His church from things seen to things unseen&mdash;v. 27; 1 Pet. 1:8.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>&ldquo;Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:16:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The outer man consists of the body as its organ with the soul as its life and person; the inner man consists of the regenerated spirit as its life and person with the renewed soul as its organ.</li>
	<li>In order to live a crucified life, the life of the soul must be denied (Matt. 16:24-25), but the functions of the soul&mdash;the mind, will, and emotion&mdash;must be renewed and uplifted by being subdued (2 Cor. 10:4-5) so that they can be used by the spirit, the person of the inner man.</li>
	<li>Our outer man is being consumed and worn out, but our inner man is being daily renewed by being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Christian life is a life of being renewed day by day with the divine element through the process of sufferings&mdash;1 Thes. 3:3; Jer. 48:11:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>We are renewed by the cross, the Holy Spirit, our mingled spirit, and the word of God&mdash;2 Cor. 4:10; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23; 5:26.</li>
			<li>We need to be revived every morning&mdash;Matt. 13:43; Prov. 4:18.</li>
			<li>We should come to the Lord&rsquo;s table in the principle of newness by forgiving others and seeking to be forgiven&mdash;Matt. 26:29; 5:23-24; 18:21-22, 35.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>&ldquo;Our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. 4:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>All the sufferings God has assigned to us have one unique purpose&mdash;to renew us; today we are in the process of being renewed to become the New Jerusalem&mdash;Rev. 21:2.</li>
			<li>The weight of glory will become the beauty of the adorned bride&mdash;v. 11.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
