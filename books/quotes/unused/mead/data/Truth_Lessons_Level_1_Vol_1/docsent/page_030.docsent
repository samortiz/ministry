   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Concerning the Birth of Christ 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Virgin Conceiving and Bearing a Son</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Isaiah 7:14, God more clearly reveals the promise of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, it tells us that the coming Christ, as promised in Genesis 3, was not to be born of a married woman but of a virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the other hand, it also tells us that this Christ who was to be born of a virgin to be our Savior is God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is God with us, Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He comes into the midst of men, God comes into the midst of men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He comes to be man s Savior, God comes to be man s Savior; God Himself comes of a virgin to be man s Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unto Us a Child Being Born</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and a Son Being Given</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although this Christ who came to be our Savior was a child, He was called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although He was a son, He was called the eternal Father Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s promise tells us clearly that the coming Christ is both man and God, both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He became a man; nevertheless, He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the Son, yet He is also the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although He came to the earth to be a newborn child, He is still the mighty God who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although He was manifested to be the Son in time, He is also the self-existing and ever-existing Father in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His Goings Forth Having Been</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>from of Old, from Everlasting</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although He was born in Bethlehem of Judah, His origin is from eternity Micah 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the eternal Father, yet He came to be a man in time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He certainly is God, and He surely is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>F. Concerning the Human Living of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The earthly human living of this Redeemer promised by God was clearly foretold to us in every aspect in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was born lowly as a tender plant.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He came from a poor family, as a root out of a dry ground, without a rich supply and without a comfortable living.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, He had no form nor comeliness; His visage was so marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men; and when we shall see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire Him Isa 53:2; 52:14; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2 Cor 8:9b; Matt 13:55-57 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Men would have expected that when the Redeemer came, His countenance would surely be desirable to them, just as Moses and David both were handsome in appearance Acts 7:20; 1 Sam 16:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And yet He had no comeliness, but appeared worn and old.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was a man of thirty, but people took Him for a man of fifty John 8:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In reality, He was altogether lovely and entirely handsome; but this is invisible to our natural eyes and can only be seen through our spiritual eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He became a man of sorrows, despised and rejected of men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We hid as it were our faces from Him, and the people of God esteemed Him not Isa 53:3; Psa 22:6-7; Luke 23:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was destined to be despised and rejected, to endure suffering and hardship, and to grieve daily for the sinner s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With sacrificing love, He came to seek His people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, they rejected Him, and would not even set their eyes upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even so, God s anointed One still did not give up man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He preached the gospel to the poor and proclaimed the year of jubilee of the Lord Isa 61:1-2; Luke 4:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was the great light shining upon those who sat in darkness and in the shadow of death Isa 9:2; Matt 4:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, He would be a light to the Gentiles, that God s salvation might be carried out to the ends of the earth Isa 49:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He would not strive nor cry out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A bruised reed He would not break, and the smoking flax He would not quench Isa 42:1-3; Matt 12:17-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only would He not cry out in the streets, but He also would not break the bruised reed nor quench the smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Old Testament time, Jewish children used to make flutes of reeds.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When a reed was bruised and could not give the proper note, they broke it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Jews also made torches with flax to burn the oil to give a shining light at night.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, when the oil ran out, the flax smoked and could not shine forth light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then people would quench it and throw it away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Jews who were against Christ were like a bruised reed and smoking flax.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, Christ was full of compassion toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He did not break them, and He did not quench them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He still opened the door of grace to them.</S>
