   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN EATING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY PRAYING OVER THE WORD Scripture Reading: Psa 36:7-9; 34:8; 42:1-2; Matt 4:4; 1 Pet 2:2-3; 1 Cor 10:3-4; 12:13; John 6:57, 63 EATING AND DRINKING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s eternal intention, which is the central thought of the Bible, is that we would be mingled with God and become the Body of Christ by eating, drinking, and even digesting Him as our spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This matter of eating is revealed at the beginning of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was the first matter that God raised up with man after creating man Gen 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God told man that he had to eat the proper thing, and if we examine the Scriptures carefully, we will realize that the proper thing for man to eat and to take as his food supply is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man was created as a vessel to contain God Rom 9:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, we must take God into us as our content.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has revealed that the way for us to take Him in is by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Gospel of John the Lord Himself said, I am the bread of life, and He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me 6:48, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many Christians are concerned with knowing about the Lord, but not many have seen that the Scriptures reveal that we must also eat and drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old Testament the psalmist said, As the hart pants / After the streams of water, / So my soul pants / For You, O God / My soul thirsts for God, / For the living God Psa 42:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The psalmist was thirsty for God as the living water cf.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>John 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the New Testament the apostle Paul tells us that the manna and the water that the people of Israel ate and drank in the wilderness are both types of Christ 1 Cor 10:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today, since we have Christ as the reality of the types, we must make eating and drinking the Lord our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First Corinthians 12:13 tells us that we have not only been baptized in the Spirit but have also been made to drink of this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must eat and drink the Lord as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be deeply impressed regarding our need to eat and drink the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The experience of eating and drinking a certain thing is much more subjective than merely knowing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may know many things about bread and milk, but if we do not eat and drink the bread and milk, they will remain objective and be of no value to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The most important thing is that we take the bread and milk into us by eating and drinking them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Similarly, we may know many teachings about Christ, but if we do not eat and drink Christ, Christ will remain objective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This does not mean that Christian teachings are bad; they are actually good and necessary, but this depends on what we do with them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must certainly know about the person and work of Christ, but the main thing is that we receive Him in a practical and subjective way by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to take Christ as our food and drink, we must be very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One does not need a great amount of knowledge in order to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In fact, our knowledge often complicates us and hinders us from eating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After I was regenerated, I was taught many Christian teachings and was trained in a profound way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Consequently, I became a complicated person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, today I am a very simple Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being a Christian is less a matter of knowing and more a matter of eating and drinking Christ day by day and moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to be simple and take in the Lord as our food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PRAYING OVER THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must realize that the Lord today is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17 and that the Lord is also the Word John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These are the two biggest gifts we have as Christians the Spirit within our spirit and the Word of God in our hands Rom 8:16; 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, if we want to eat and drink Christ, we must come to the Word of God and enjoy the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to receive the Lord through the Word, we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we want to look at something, we will automatically exercise our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we want to hear something, we will spontaneously use our ears.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we are going to walk or run, we will begin to exercise our legs and feet.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Similarly, when we are going to pray, we must exercise our spirit Eph 6:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without exercising our spirit, we cannot pray in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since we may be accustomed to praying from our mind, we need to practice exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a baby first begins to move around, he mainly uses his hands and arms.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, as he continues to move around, he eventually reaches a point at which he begins to use his feet and legs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Likewise, when we begin praying, we often begin by using our mind, but after praying continually for a while, we will reach a point at which we will begin to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must pray over what we read in the Word and take in what we read by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Ephesians 6:17 and 18 tell us to receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should receive the word of God not merely by exercising our mind to understand but by means of all prayer and petition, praying by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>By this, the word becomes spirit and life to us in our experience John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For instance, Philippians 2:6 says, Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In taking this verse, we may pray, Lord, You have the form of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I praise and worship You that You have the form of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Just as we eat bread by taking a little piece and chewing it, we should simply take a short phrase of a verse and turn the words of the Bible into our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we may take the next phrase and chew on it by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we pray over the Word in such a way, we eat and drink the Lord who is the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This kind of practice is vital to our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This practice will cause the Word to become the life supply to our spirit instead of mere knowledge to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There are all kinds of food and riches stored in the Bible, and our urgent need is to take and receive them little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we read through the Bible in this way, we will be fed and filled.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As the psalmist said, we will be saturated with the fatness of the Lord s house and drink of the river of His pleasures Psa 36:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we exercise our spirit to pray over the Word, we will be satisfied, strengthened, and refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, if we merely take the Word in as knowledge, we will become proud.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will think that we have spiritual vision or revelation, when in fact we may not.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Knowledge makes us proud 1 Cor 8:1 , but the inward working of the Spirit makes us humble.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we take the Word as our life supply, as the Lord Himself, we will spontaneously be humble, because the Lord as the humble One will live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Also, if we do this, our spirit will be strong, living, and active in the meetings and in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many Christians are weak in their spirit because they exercise their mind too much to merely study the Word and do not spend enough time exercising their spirit to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus, although they may be experts in the doctrinal knowledge of the Bible, it is difficult for them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more we take the Word in by praying over it, the more our spirit will be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have diligently studied the Scriptures for many years, and today I continue to study them.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, my way of studying is different than it was before.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When I was young, I studied merely with my mind, but today I do not merely study the Word with my mind but also take the Word into my being by praying over the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Many things may begin to happen when we pray over the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord will speak to us from the Word, using the words that we read to converse with us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For instance, we may read Philippians 2:7, which says that the Lord emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We may tell the Lord, Lord, thank You for emptying Yourself, but then the Lord may ask us, What about you?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Have you emptied yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then we may repent to the Lord for not emptying ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Furthermore, the Lord may check with us regarding our spouse or the saints, which may lead us to intercede for them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thus, the Lord will use the words that we read to converse with us.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this way the Lord will adjust us, correct us, enlighten us, cleanse us, and anoint us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If our time is occupied with this kind of prayer, and it turns out that there is no time left to pray for our situations, we may tell the Lord, Lord, there are many matters on my heart, and there is no time to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You know what is in my heart; take care of all these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Word promises that if we seek first the kingdom and His righteousness, all our daily needs will be added to us Matt 6:33 .</S>
