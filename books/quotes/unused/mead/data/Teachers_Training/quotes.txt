[1]  CONTENTS The Proper Understanding of Teaching Receiving the Word as the Living Spirit and Coming to the Full Knowledge of the Truth Learning to Teach God's Economy in an Experiential Way Knowing the Structure of the Truth, Being Saturated with the Truth, and Converting Doctrine into Experience
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF TEACHING Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:16-17; John 6:63; Eph 6:17
[3]  In this series of messages we will cover some important matters related to training teachers to serve with the young people in the Summer School of Truth.
[4]  The reason we need to set aside our personal lexicons and study the words of the Scriptures is that the Scriptures teach us the things of God and the things concerning God.
[5]  My burden in this message is to point out what the nature of the Summer School of Truth is.
[6]  If you realize this, then you will also realize that it is not sufficient merely to teach your class with the lesson book as if you were teaching in a secular school.
[7]  You need to labor to bring every young person in your class to the Triune God, so that by the time you have finished all the lessons, the students in your class will have gained the Triune God and will have been filled with God, not with mere knowledge about God in letters.
[8]  In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus says, "It is the Spirit who gives life the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."
[9]  The goal of our summer school is to present teaching after teaching, revelation after revelation, so that the young ones may see God, see themselves, and be reproved, corrected, and instructed to be right with God and man that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO RECEIVING THE WORD AS THE LIVING SPIRIT AND COMING TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:16-17; John 6:63; Matt 4:4; Eph 6:17-18; 1 Tim 2:4
[11]  NOURISHING OTHERS WITH THE WORD THAT PROCEEDS OUT THROUGH THE MOUTH OF GOD
[12]  In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God."
[13]  When you teach the Bible to others, you should nourish them.
[14]  At this juncture I would ask you to consider how, in a practical way, the word of the Bible can become the sword of the Spirit for fighting against the enemy.
[15]  I am concerned that in the Summer School of Truth you will teach the young people merely in a mental way, as if you were teaching in a secular school.
[16]  According to Paul's word toward the end of Ephesians, a book concerning the church, we need to receive the word of God in a living way, that is, receive the word as the Spirit.
[17]  CHAPTER THREE LEARNING TO TEACH GOD'S ECONOMY IN AN EXPERIENTIAL WAY Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 1:3-4; 2 Tim 1:6-7; 2:2, 22
[18]  In the books of 1 and 2 Timothy we can see the way we should teach others.
[19]  Regarding teaching, Paul charged Timothy, saying, "The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also" 2 Tim 2:2 .
[20]  In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul spoke to Timothy, one of his closest co-workers, saying, "Even as I exhorted you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God's economy, which is in faith."
[21]  Those who teach in the Summer School of Truth must open their entire being spirit, heart, soul, mind, emotion and will so that the "draft" may come in. The Spirit is in you already, but you need to fan the fire, the Spirit, into flame.
[22]  You have the Spirit and eternal life within you, but because you are closed the draft cannot come in. If you are this kind of person, you will teach the young people merely according to your knowledge or according to what is printed in the lesson book.
[23]  We all should be those who teach God's economy, who fan the gift of God into flame, who call on the name of the Lord Jesus, and who exercise our spirit.
[24]  I have no doubt that, as believers in Christ, you have received the eternal life and the divine Spirit, but I am concerned that you will go to your class with "ice water" instead of a flame.
[25]  Not Giving Lectures but Talking in a Personal Way
[26]  As you are teaching the young people in your class, you should frequently talk to them in a personal and practical way.
[27]  For instance, you might say, "Are you not unhappy when your brother or sister has something that you do not have?
[28]  CHAPTER FOUR KNOWING THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRUTH, BEING SATURATED WITH THE TRUTH, AND CONVERTING DOCTRINE INTO EXPERIENCE Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:4; 3:15; 2 Tim 2:15, 25
[29]  In order to teach in an experiential way, you must convert every point in the lesson from doctrine into experience.
