<p>In the second step God was merely among men. He was manifested among men, but He still had not accomplished His purpose, which is to enter into man as man&rsquo;s life. If God cannot enter into man, He will not become man&rsquo;s life. If God wants man to worship Him, to serve Him, to please Him, to obey His will, or to work for Him, it is sufficient for Him to stay outside of man. However, in order to be man&rsquo;s life, He must enter into man. He cannot be man&rsquo;s life unless He enters into man. Hence, as the eternal God who dwells in unapproachable light, He cannot be man&rsquo;s life. Neither was it sufficient for Him to be manifested among men, because He still could not be man&rsquo;s life. In order to achieve His purpose of becoming man&rsquo;s life, the Son had to be transfigured. The Father was manifested as the Son, and the Son was transfigured as the Spirit. God is embodied in the Son, and the Son is realized as the Spirit so that He can enter into us as life. This is the third step.</p>
<p>Chapter 14 of the Gospel of John is a turning point. The first thirteen chapters speak of the Father being manifested in the Son, that is, the Word becoming flesh and dwelling among men. However, He could only dwell among men; He could not enter into men. Then in chapter 14 the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;If I go...I am coming again&rdquo; (v. 3). His going was His coming. His going was His suffering death, and His coming was His resurrection. By His going and coming through death and resurrection, He was transfigured to be the Spirit. Through such a transfiguration He is now able to enter into us. His going was His coming (vv. 2-3). He came to us as the Comforter, who is in us and will be with us forever (vv. 16-20). Before chapter 14 the Gospel of John does not speak of the Lord being in His disciples and of their being in the Lord; rather, it speaks of the Word becoming flesh and dwelling among men. In chapter 14 the Lord began to speak of His entering into man. This turning point depends on His coming as the Spirit.</p>
<p>In the evening on the day of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, while the doors were shut where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, the Lord came and stood in the midst of them (20:19). No one knows how the Lord came in; this is something we do not understand. The Lord Jesus stood among the disciples and breathed into them and said, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (v. 22). The Bible does not tell us where the Lord went after He breathed into the disciples.</p>
<p>In chapter 13 the Lord washed the feet of the disciples. After washing their feet, He spoke to them at length for three chapters, chapters 14 through 16. After speaking with the disciples, He prayed, and His prayer is recorded in chapter 17. After praying, He took the disciples to the Garden of Gethsemane, where He was seized, and He was taken to the high priest and to Pilate to be judged; this is chapter 18. In chapter 19 He was nailed to the cross and put into a tomb. In chapter 20 He was resurrected, and He first ascended to the Father God. Then in the evening the Lord appeared to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, &ldquo;Receive the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Bible does not tell us where He went after this. However, on the evening of the next Lord&rsquo;s Day He came again and said to Thomas, &ldquo;Bring your finger here and see My hands, and bring your hand and put it into My side.&rdquo; Thomas answered and said to Him, &ldquo;My Lord and my God!&rdquo; Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed&rdquo; (vv. 27-29). Again the Bible does not tell us what happened next. Thus, we do not know where the Lord went. Then in chapter 21 the disciples went fishing for a whole night but caught nothing. Suddenly, the Lord Jesus appeared on the shore and invited them to breakfast. After breakfast the Lord asked Peter three times, &ldquo;Do you love Me?&rdquo; (vv. 15-17). Then He said, &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; (v. 19). Again we are not told where the Lord went after this incident.</p>
<p>It seems as though the Lord disappeared. Some people have said that the Lord ascended to heaven. However, chapter 21 does not record the ascension of the Lord Jesus. Where did the Lord go? He said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (14:20). The Lord entered into the disciples. He entered into them as the Holy Spirit. The Father was manifested among men in the Son, and the Son was transfigured as the Spirit to enter into man. When the Son was transfigured as the Spirit, He could enter into man. The Spirit enters into man to be man&rsquo;s life. God the Son can enter into man because He has been transfigured as the Spirit. God is Spirit.</p>
<p>Perhaps some do not understand this. They think that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three and wonder how can They be one. This is truly a mystery, but here is an illustration. When we take an ice cube out of the freezer, it will become water after a period of time. Although ice and water have different forms, they are actually one. Water is ice, and ice is water; the two are one. If we keep the water out of the refrigerator for a whole day, it will evaporate, disappear. The water will become vapor. Vapor has a different form from water, but vapor is water, and water is vapor; the two are one. Hence, ice is changed into water, and water becomes vapor, which is in the air for man to breathe. When we breathe in vapor, we are breathing in water, which is also ice. The three are one. Although this illustration cannot fully describe the relationship between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, it at least provides a general explanation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Father was manifested as the Son, and the Son was transfigured as the Spirit. Revelation 5:6 speaks of the Spirit being sent forth into all the earth. Hence, the Spirit fills the universe; He is omnipresent, not being limited by time or space. The Spirit is present at any time and in any place. This Spirit is the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit fills the universe. Hence, regardless of time or place, the Triune God will touch a person whose heart is turned to God, whose spirit is open, and whose inner being is aligned with God. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit will immediately touch his spirit and move in his spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO HAVE GOD AS OUR LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Touching the Spirit</h2>
<p>Do we want God? Do we want to obtain Him and allow Him to enter into us? In the Old Testament God was intangible and could not be found. But today He is real; He is not vague. God is embodied in the Lord Jesus, the Lord Jesus has become the Spirit, and the Spirit has been sent forth into all the earth. The Spirit is everywhere; He is omnipresent and ever-penetrating. Today He is waiting for proper persons with a proper heart and a right spirit. Wherever there is a broken and contrite heart with a spirit that is turned to God, that is, a person whose heart and spirit believes and who confesses the Lord Jesus as his Savior, the Spirit of the Triune God will enter into this person. Thus, this person will obtain God. The Father is in the Son, the Son is in the Spirit, and the Spirit enters into man. Thus, this person has the Triune God in him as his life. He has the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and eternal life; he has four items.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contacting the Word</h2>
<p>If there were only the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and life&mdash; without the Word&mdash;our obtaining God would be vague. However, the Lord is not only the Spirit but also the Word. The Gospel of John says that the Word is God, that God is Spirit, and that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit (1:1; 4:24; 6:63). If we consider these verses together, we can see that God is not only the Father, the Son, and the Spirit but also the Word. In order to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life, God became a man, the Son, and was transfigured into the Spirit. However, we still need to touch or sense Him in a concrete way. Thus, He is also the Word. The Word is real. If I am asked where we can find God, I would say in the Word and the Spirit, for the Word and the Spirit are God. Regardless of where a person is, if he uses his heart and spirit to read God&rsquo;s Word, the Spirit will touch his inner being and bring the Triune God into him, because the Word conveys the Spirit. When this Word is manifested within man, it is <em>rhema,</em> the instant word, which is also the Spirit.</p>
<p>Initially, the Bible is the constant word, <em>logos.</em> When we read the constant word with our heart and our spirit, the ever-penetrating Spirit will touch our spirit and will shine on every word that we read so that He can manifest Himself within us. Then every word and every sentence will become living and operative. This is <em>rhema</em>. The living, instant word is spirit and life. Hence, when we receive these words, we receive the Spirit as well as life. At the same time, we also receive the Triune God. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit will enter into us through the Word to be our life. Hence, we will touch and receive life; that is, we will receive the Triune God. This experience of the Triune God as the Word and life in man is the most central and mysterious matter in the universe.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
