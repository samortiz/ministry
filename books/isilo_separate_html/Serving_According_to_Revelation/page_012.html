<h1 class="title">LIMITING GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:9-10; 28:18-20</h1>
<p>We have greatly limited and hindered God in the leading and future growth of the churches and in the work in Taiwan. We are greatly indebted to God. When I consider the future of the churches and the work in Taiwan, I bear a heavy burden. We have been saved by grace, but we are limiting and hindering the Lord in this age, and yet we consider our situation to be normal. We do not sense that this is a serious matter. If we would be enlightened, we would see that it is a serious matter to limit and hinder God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING</h2>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War, the Lord opened a great and efficacious door across mainland China for us. The churches were revived and gradually brought onto the right track. We were anticipating that the Lord would accomplish something great in China, but because of the change in the political environment, we came to Taiwan. When I arrived in Taiwan, my heart was full of sorrow because I felt that there was not much to do. After a while I visited the saints who had come from different parts of mainland China and who were then in central and southern Taiwan. After visiting the saints, I realized that the Lord had a work to do here. The Lord had a wonderful purpose in bringing us to Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Lord showed me that many people from different provinces on the mainland had gathered in Taiwan. Hence, if we would preach the gospel, we could gain not only local people but also people from all over mainland China. In terms of geographical location and language, Taiwan is in close proximity to Northeast and Southeast Asia. Therefore, our gospel work would also give us access to Southeast Asia as well as to Japan. I feel strongly that this is the Lord&rsquo;s intention in bringing us to Taiwan.</p>
<p>I shared this feeling with the responsible brothers in the church in Taipei. After the meeting hall on Ren-ai Road had been completed in the summer of 1949, we began the work from Taipei as the center. In August we held a special edification conference. This was the formal beginning of the work in Taiwan. In the last two and a half years the Lord has used the environment to confirm our feeling.</p>
<p>Among us there were brothers and sisters from more than thirty provinces in China. These saints had been under our leading and edification, and they could function for the Lord wherever they went. Among us there were also local saints who had a heart for the Lord and who were willing to live for the Lord. They had a burden to preach the gospel to local people.</p>
<p>The Lord arranged for me to visit Southeast Asia three times. During those visits I fellowshipped with the saints there, and we were mutually supplied. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace, the fellowship and coordination between Taiwan and Southeast Asia will be strengthened in the future.</p>
<p>Among us there are also a few saints who love the Lord and who can understand the Japanese language. In the future they might be led by the Lord to preach the gospel and bear His testimony in Japan. Through these situations the Lord has confirmed our feeling and made us joyful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PREPARATIONS</h2>
<p>The Lord also prepared Taiwan. Although this is a small island, it has a concentrated population, a stable environment, and religious freedom. These conditions make it very convenient for us to preach the gospel and establish churches.</p>
<p>The Lord also has prepared convenient transportation in Taiwan. In six days I had three meetings in Kaohsiung and visited five churches. I have even visited three places in one day. The transportation is extremely convenient for the gospel.</p>
<p>The Lord led many saints from mainland China to Taiwan, and He has used the environment to scatter these saints throughout the major cities. Our brothers and sisters can be found in most of the major cities in Taiwan. The Lord has prepared the manpower. Now He can use these saints to spread the gospel for the establishment of His churches.</p>
<p>Many people have had a turn in their heart and are now open to the gospel because of the changes in the world situation. Twenty years ago ten people may have received the Lord when we preached the gospel. Now when we preach the gospel, thousands of people want to receive the Lord. These people know in their heart that they cannot depend on anything in the world, so they are seeking the Lord. The Lord has used the environment to prepare people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>The Lord has even prepared the necessary funds for us to spread the gospel and establish churches. Most of the saints in Taiwan are government workers or school teachers, and the saints who are businessmen are not so prosperous. Therefore, our financial capacity is very weak. However, the Lord has used the saints in Southeast Asia to make up our lack in this aspect.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
