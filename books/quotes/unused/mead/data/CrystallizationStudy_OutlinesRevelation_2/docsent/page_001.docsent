   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The main thought of the second section of Revelation is God s building 15:5: The vision of the temple with the ark is not for us to be holy or spiritual it is for us to be built up 11:19.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The temple and the ark are for God s testimony, and God s testimony is God s expression of Himself through His building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ark in the temple signifies Christ as God s testimony 11:19: The ark signifies that God must be faithful to Himself, that He will not do anything that comes short of Himself, and that what He desires to do He will accomplish 2 Tim 2:13; Eph 1:9-11.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The revelation in the Bible leads us from the throne of God s government to the temple of God s expression 4:2; 7:15; 11:19; 15:5; 16:17: Revelation first shows us the throne as the center of God s judgment and then the temple as the center of God s testimony 4:2-3; 7:15; 11:19; 15:5.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ultimately, in 16:17 the throne and the temple are combined: Here God s judgment is mingled with God s expression, with God s testimony.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The overcomers are the instrument that enables God to achieve His purpose; the man-child enables God to move vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>10-11: The man-child consists of the overcomers who stand on behalf of the church, take the position which the whole church should take, and do the work for the church 2:7b, 11b, 17b, 26-28; 3:5, 12, 21; 12:5, 11.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the war between the dragon and the Lord s recovery today, the battle is being fought by the strong ones, by the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God will use the man-child to fulfill His economy and to accomplish His purpose 1 Tim 1:4; 2 Tim 1:9; Eph 1:9, 11; 3:11: God needs the man-child to defeat His enemy and to bring in His kingdom that His eternal purpose might be accomplished Rev 12:10.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord s recovery is the practicality of God s economy today, and His economy can be carried out only by the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rapture of the man-child is a transaction that causes Satan to have no more position in heaven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>5, 7-10: This indicates that the overcoming saints will exert a great influence upon the coming warfare in the heavens vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>5, 7a.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The rapture is for God s economy and God s strategy; we must be raptured to fulfill God s need by executing His judgment upon His enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The man-child is related to God s most important dispensational move Matt 6:9-10; Rev 12:10; 11:15: God wants to end this age and bring in the age of the kingdom, and for this He must have the man-child as His dispensational instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The rapture of the man-child brings an end to the church age and introduces the age of the kingdom 12:5, 10.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The rapture of the man-child to heaven, the casting of Satan to earth, and the declaration in heaven signify that the man-child will bring the kingdom to earth; this is God s greatest dispensational move vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>5, 9-10; 11:15.</S>
