   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The works of the flesh...Those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God....They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts Gal 5:19, 21, 24; see also 1 Cor 6:9-10; Eph 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The kingdom of God is absolutely holy; therefore, evil and filthy people cannot inherit the kingdom of God.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The salvation spoken of in this verse is not the salvation related to our spirit through regeneration but rather the salvation of entering into the kingdom of the heavens, the salvation of our soul in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This salvation can be obtained if we suffer for the Lord today and endure to the end. As we follow the Lord, Satan often uses worldly people to persecute, attack, and torment us.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These verses show that fighting the good fight, finishing the course, and keeping the faith are conditions for obtaining a crown and entering the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To fight the good fight is to fight for the Lord; to finish the course is to complete the ministry which the Lord commissioned; to keep the faith is to keep the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do these things today, we will certainly receive a crown as a reward when we enter the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The crown that the apostle will be given comes from the righteous Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Loving the Lord s appearing cannot be separated from loving the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we really love the Lord, we will love His appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we love the Lord s appearing, we will be like John on the island of Patmos, who was for the Lord and said, Come, Lord Jesus!</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Israelites could not enter into the rest of Canaan, which typifies the rest of the kingdom, because they did not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the Bible exhorts us to be diligent to enter into the rest of the kingdom lest we be like the Israelites, who had an evil heart of unbelief and rejected the living God, and be unable to enter into the rest of the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should be like Caleb and Joshua who were diligent to go into the land of Canaan by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We cannot be lacking in the diligence that comes from faith if we want to enter the kingdom.</S>
