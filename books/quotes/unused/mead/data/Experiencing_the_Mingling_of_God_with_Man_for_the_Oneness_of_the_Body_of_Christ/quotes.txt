[1]  Experiencing the Mingling of God with Man for the Oneness of the Body of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE APPLYING CHRIST AS LIFE IN OUR DAILY LIFE Scripture Reading: John 1:4, 1, 14, 17-18; 4:14; 5:39-40; 6:35, 53-57, 63; Col 1:12; 2:16-17
[3]  In these first few messages we would like to consider the Gospel of John, which has three main points Christ as life, the increase of Christ, and the oneness of the increase of Christ.
[4]  The entire Bible and the Gospel of John in particular reveal to us that God s eternal intention is to work Himself into us and be mingled with us so that we may have Him as our life and that He may be expressed through us.
[5]  In order to accomplish this intention, the Lord Jesus came to us as the Word of God so that we could receive Him and take Him as our life.
[6]  Thus, if we want to gain and experience God, we must take Christ as our life by eating Christ as our food and drinking Christ as our drink.
[7]  However, I have discovered that although most of the Lord s children know that Christ is life and that He is the bread of life, they do not know the practical way to take Christ as their bread, and they do not have the experience of Christ as life.
[8]  Let us go on positively by taking Christ, experiencing Christ, applying Christ, and exercising to appropriate Christ moment by moment in our daily living.
[9]  However, the Lord told the disciples, It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life v. 63 . In order to apply Christ as our life, we must understand the relationship between the word and the Spirit.
[10]  If we have this kind of experience, we will become the increase of Christ, and when we become the increase of Christ, we will see the oneness of the increase of Christ John 3:29-30 .
[11]  AND THE ONENESS OF THE INCREASE Scripture Reading: John 3:29-30; 12:24-25; 15:5; 17:21-23; 20:17; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 12:12-13 THE CHURCH AS THE INCREASE OF CHRIST
[12]  The Gospel of John tells us that the Lord Jesus came to give us life and that this life is Himself 10:10b; 14:6 .
[13]  Christ Himself is life to us, so when we receive Christ, we receive life.
[14]  In our natural life we are the increase and multiplication of Adam, but as those who have been reborn, we have the life of Christ, and because of this divine life, we are the increase and multiplication of Christ.
[15]  If we love the Lord and are seeking His heart, we will realize that the urgent need today is that we practice what we know about Christ in all the affairs of our daily life.
[16]  If we live by our natural life, we will not realize this matter, but if we reject ourselves and take Christ as our life in our daily affairs, we will realize that we are each parts of the Body of Christ and that we need to depend on the other members Rom 12:4-5 .
[17]  On the morning of the Lord s resurrection, the Lord appeared to Mary and told her, Go to My brothers v. 17 . In 1:14 the Lord is called the only begotten Son of God, but chapter 20 tells us that the Lord has brothers, indicating that the Lord was multiplied.
[18]  We must also see the oneness of the increase of Christ.
[19]  This is why the Lord prayed in John 17:21-23, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me.
[20]  Verse 21 shows us that Christ is in the Father, the Father is in Christ, and we are one by being in Christ.
[21]  It is possible for us to be one with others because we are in Christ, we have the divine life, and Christ is in us.
[22]  If we are going to be the full expression of Christ as the Body of Christ, we must realize that we have the divine life and that we are one in this life.
[23]  If we constantly take Him as our life, apply Him to all the matters in our daily living, and walk, work, and live in Him and let Him live in us to be our perfection, we will be one as the increase of Christ.
[24]  May the Lord be gracious to us that we would practice to apply Christ as our life in our daily living and realize that we are in Christ and that Christ is in us so that we may be one.
[25]  The Gospel of John reveals Christ as life and the oneness of the Body of Christ.
[26]  The first man, Adam, who was created according to the image of Christ, was a figure or photograph of Christ Rom 5:14 ; that is, he had the image of Christ, but he did not have Christ as his life.
[27]  Instead, He told us that we need to believe into Him v. 29 . For us to believe into Him is simply to receive Him into us 1:12 . The Lord also told us that after receiving Him we must learn how to abide in Him and how to let Him abide in us, just as the branches of a vine abide in the vine and let the vine abide in them.
[28]  In the Gospel of John there is not only the matter of life but also the matter of oneness.
[29]  After doing so many things on the earth, the Lord prayed to the Father that all the believers would be one in Him.
[30]  TO REALIZE THE ONENESS OF THE BODY 1 Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 4:24; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; John 6:57, 63; 14:20; Gal 2:20; Matt 10:19-20; John 17:21-23; 1 Cor 12:13
[31]  There are two crucial matters in the Scriptures Christ as life and the Body of Christ.
[32]  This shows us that God s intention is that He would be life to us so that we would be built together in His life as one Body, the holy city.
[33]  Mingling is a matter of God becoming life to us Lev 2:4-5; 1 Cor 6:17 ; when we take God as our life and God becomes life to us, He mingles Himself with us.
[34]  God s eternal purpose is that we would daily take Him as our life, life supply, and food so that He can be mingled with us.
[35]  When we love others in the Lord, the love with which we love them should be the mingling of God with us.
[36]  In order to practice this we must be reminded that the Lord is the Spirit, that we have a spirit, and that we have been reborn in our spirit by the Spirit of the Lord 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Thes 5:23; John 3:6 .
[37]  On the one hand, he tells us that Christ is life to us and that we have to take Christ as our life and live by Christ Col 3:4 .
[38]  THE WAY TO HAVE THE MINGLING AND THE ONENESS
[39]  We may realize the importance of these two matters the mingling of the divine life with man and the oneness of the Body but now we must ask ourselves how much we have been mingled with the divine life and how much we are actually in the oneness of the Body.
[40]  The extent to which the Lord values us depends on how much of the divine mingling we have and how much we are in the oneness of the Body.
[41]  John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit, John 4:24 says, God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit, and Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.
[42]  Thus, the way to take the Lord as our life is not by thinking or using our mind but by exercising our spirit to contact the Lord as the Spirit.
[43]  The Bible reveals that we were made as vessels so that the Lord could be our life and content.
[44]  However, many times when we come to the meetings or read the Word, we do not have a heart that is turned toward the Lord, or we do not know how to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord.
[45]  When we have such a pure heart, we will have the presence of the Lord.
[46]  God s eternal intention, which is the central thought of the Bible, is that we would be mingled with God and become the Body of Christ by eating, drinking, and even digesting Him as our spiritual food.
[47]  God told man that he had to eat the proper thing, and if we examine the Scriptures carefully, we will realize that the proper thing for man to eat and to take as his food supply is God Himself.
[48]  Similarly, we may know many teachings about Christ, but if we do not eat and drink Christ, Christ will remain objective to us.
[49]  If we practice praying over the Word, we will experience the Lord in a very living way, and after a period of time we will be accustomed to speaking to the Lord in a very living yet ordinary and conversational way.
[50]  We will speak with the Lord not only when we are by ourselves in a private room but also while we are talking with others.
[51]  We will be living not by our natural life but by the Lord Himself, and we will be living another kind of life, a life not by ourselves but a life with the Lord.
[52]  If we want to contact the Lord and be mingled with Him, we must know the distinctions between the spirit, the soul, and the heart in more detail.
[53]  Loving the Lord is only the beginning; eventually, we must take Him in. We may love the Lord with our whole heart, but if we do not take Him in, we cannot gain Him.
[54]  Our problem today is that although we may know how to love the Lord with our heart and how to read and meditate upon the Scriptures with our mind, we simply do not know how to exercise our spirit to take in the Lord.
[55]  We must realize that the Lord is the Spirit and that the only way we can contact Him and take Him in is by using our spirit 2 Cor 3:17; John 4:24 .
[56]  CHAPTER NINE TRANSFORMATION Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-27; Col 1:15; Rom 5:14; 8:29; Gal 4:19; 2 Cor 3:17-18; Rom 12:2; 8:6; 2 Cor 2:16; Eph 4:22-23; Col 3:9-11; Eph 2:15; Ezek.
[57]  In order to be conformed to the image of Christ, God first made us in the image of Christ and then caused us to believe in the Lord Jesus and receive Him as our life.
[58]  We must realize that although we are vessels of Christ and Christ is now in us as our content, our inward parts, which include our mind, will, emotion, and heart, may not be suitable for Christ to occupy, because they may be occupied by something other than Christ.
[59]  Christ is now in our spirit, but He may not have much ground, room, or place in the other parts of our being, especially our mind.
[60]  We have seen that the mingling of God with us is a matter of our receiving the divine life and that oneness is a matter of our being built up as the Body of Christ.
[61]  In order to be one with us, God as the Spirit came into our spirit that we might be mingled with Him.
[62]  It may help to see how God is triune by using 2 Corinthians 13:14, which says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
[63]  John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ, because Jesus Christ as grace is the expression of God and the expression of God s love v. 18; 1 John 4:9 . Love is the source within God, and grace is the expression of that love to us in the person of Christ.
[64]  If we are going to enjoy the love of God, we must have the grace of Christ, and if we are going to have the grace of Christ, we must have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[65]  THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT
[66]  These three steps of our experience of the Spirit show us that the work of the Spirit has two aspects the inward aspect and the outward aspect.
[67]  When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the Spirit came into us to regenerate us, and since the day of our regeneration, He has been filling us with Himself.
[68]  However, in the two books written by Luke, the preposition most often used in relation to the Spirit is upon, as in Luke 1:35, which says, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and Acts 1:8, which says, You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you.
[69]  We can experience this mingling because God is triune; that is, the Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit as the very expression and realization of the Triune God can enter into us.
[70]  As we love the Lord and exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, we will realize that we must reject and deny our natural man, our soul-life Matt 16:24-25 .
[71]  Christ will be our very element so that when we love, Christ loves in us; when we think, Christ thinks in our mind; and when we speak, Christ speaks through us.
[72]  From this we can see that with respect to the matter of life, it is sufficient to have Christ in us as our life, but for our service we must put on Christ as our clothing.
[73]  These apostles prayed that the Samaritan believers would be baptized in the Spirit v. 15 , and when they laid their hands on the Samaritans, the Holy Spirit came upon them v. 17 . Before their baptism in the Spirit, the Samaritans had the Holy Spirit within, because they had believed in the Lord Jesus, but they did not have the Spirit upon them.
