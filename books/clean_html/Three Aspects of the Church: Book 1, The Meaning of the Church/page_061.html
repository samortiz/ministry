<h2 class="head4">The Consecration</h2>
<p>David prepared the materials for the building of the temple. In 1 Chronicles 29:3 and 5 David said, &ldquo;Furthermore, because I set my affection on the house of my God, and since I have a private treasure of gold and silver, I give it for the house of my God over and above all that I have prepared for this holy house...Gold for the things of gold and the silver for the things of silver and for all the work by the hands of the craftsmen. And who will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to Jehovah?&rdquo; David prepared the materials, and this preparation became his offering. The materials that he prepared were offered mainly by him, but he charged the children of Israel also to give. The children of Israel were moved to give something to God. In these verses the thought related to consecration for the building of the church is not according to our usual understanding of consecration, which is to offer material things to God. This understanding is superficial. The deeper meaning of consecration is that in the building of the church there is a need for the consecration of the person. The building of the church does not merely require the material offerings but the consecration of our person.</p>
<p>For example, some responsible brothers may feel that meetings should be started in a certain locality. As a result, they discuss the matter and ask a brother to go and serve in the locality in order to meet the need. This brother may feel that since the responsible brothers have given him a commission, he should accept it; nevertheless, he may do so reluctantly. This kind of practice is not right. However, in today&rsquo;s organized Christianity, the situation is worse. A group of people first establishes a &ldquo;church&rdquo;; then they go to a seminary to find an outstanding student from among the graduates. If the seminary agrees, the student is sent to be the resident pastor after he graduates. This has absolutely nothing to do with consecration. Such a practice is not the way to build the church. The way to build the church is for every builder to be consecrated. If there is a need in a certain locality, some brothers and sisters should receive the burden according to what they see from the Lord, and they should give themselves to the Lord to meet the need. This kind of consecration is according to the principle for the building of the temple.</p>
<p>The principle for building the church is consecration. Without consecration, the building of the church will not be accomplished. Consecration does not refer only to offering material riches. Offering material riches occupies only a small part. The greater part of consecration for the building is offering ourselves to God. When David was preparing materials for the building of the temple, he declared to the children of Israel, &ldquo;Who will offer willingly, consecrating himself today to Jehovah?&rdquo; (v. 5). This indicates that God&rsquo;s desire was for everyone to consecrate himself and participate in the building of the temple. Once David made the proclamation, the children of Israel consecrated themselves (vv. 6-9). Hence, the building of the church is in resurrection and in consecration. If the consecration in a certain locality is strong, the building of the local church will be strong; if the consecration is solid, the building of the local church will be solid. On the contrary, if the consecration is weak, the building of the local church will be weak, and if the consecration is poor, the building of the local church will be poor.</p>
<p>Those who serve the Lord cannot use human methods in doing the Lord&rsquo;s work. We may see a capable person and desire to bring him to the church, or we may find a person who is good at contacting people and desire to make him a leading one, thinking that this will build up the church. But no matter what is built in this way, it will be blown away when the wind and the rain comes. The genuine building of the church does not occur by attracting and adding brothers or sisters with special talents; rather, it occurs when brothers and sisters have an absolute consecration according to their burden. Only when there is consecration is there building. Without consecration, there is no building. The building of the church depends upon consecration and not upon looking for people to attract and add to the church. Wherever we do a work and establish a local church, we should not attract people by our human hands; rather, we need to show them our lovely and glorious Lord and how much He deserves our service. He is worthy of our all. We should give our life to the Lord just as Mary poured the ointment on His head (Matt. 26:7). This is the building of the church.</p>
<p>Often we hear people say, &ldquo;This brother is very talented. If he stayed with us, he would be very useful. Regrettably, he has been taken away from us.&rdquo; At first, this may sound right, but in fact it is not correct. If such a talented one stayed among us, I am afraid that he would be useful only for creating disputes and dissensions. Birds of a feather flock together. A certain kind of person seeks others of his own kind. If we seek those who are talented, talented ones will spontaneously come in among us. However, if we have learned the matter of consecration, the true followers of the Lord will come into our midst.</p>
<p>In 1949 when I began the work in Taiwan, many Sunday churchgoers came into our midst to &ldquo;worship.&rdquo; At that time there were not many who came for the gospel; many came only to attend the &ldquo;worship.&rdquo; At a certain point, I had a feeling before the Lord that I needed to speak a strong word to them. Therefore, I said, &ldquo;In our service to the Lord, we have no intention of developing into something big, nor do we want to limit the work of the Holy Spirit. Anyone who comes here to meet with us must have a heart that seeks only the Lord. In the way of illustration, we do not serve steamed buns or dumplings; we serve only white rice. When you come here, you must know what you want to eat. If you want to eat dumplings, there are dumpling stores elsewhere. If you want to eat steamed buns, there are places offering steamed buns elsewhere. Here, we have only white rice. If you have come here for steamed buns or dumplings, you have come to the wrong place.&rdquo; The building of the church is not accomplished by attracting people in a natural way but by consecration. If we serve the Lord in various places but are unable to present the Lord&rsquo;s loveliness, glory, and honor in order to gain their hearts for Him so that they follow Him willingly, then our work is in vain.</p>
<p>The way to build the church is not to use schemes to contact, attract, and add people. Instead, we should shut our door and bow our knees, looking to the God who is on the throne. We should not merely be busy outwardly; instead, we should fellowship with God inwardly. We should show people the Lord&rsquo;s glory, loveliness, and honor. The Lord of glory and honor deserves our all. However, we do not need to exhort people to be fervent or compel people to love the Lord. If our service is the result of human exhortation, human contact, and human relationships, we are finished before the Lord. Everyone who serves with us must be one who has seen the Lord&rsquo;s glory, loveliness, and honor. He must be one who has knelt before the Lord and told Him, &ldquo;Lord, I pour out my heart, my blood, and my life on You. I place my all at Your feet.&rdquo; Only this kind of service is well pleasing to God. The way to build up the church is through consecration.</p>
<p>We definitely acknowledge that there is a need for fellowship in spiritual matters and that under the Lord&rsquo;s leading we should spend time to contact people to dispense grace into them. However, if our motive in contacting people is to attract and win them, we will offend the Lord and be condemned by Him. If a brother has problems, some may suggest that we ask a friend to visit him; likewise, when a sister has troubles, some may suggest that we ask a relative to visit her. These methods are not the way to build up the church. The way to build up the church is by consecration and by kneeling down to pray, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, manifest Your glory that men may sense that You are glorious.&rdquo; When we pray this kind of prayer, the Lord&rsquo;s glory will manifest itself from the Holy of Holies. As a result, men will sense that the Lord is glorious and thus be willing to give their all to Him.</p>
<p>The way to build up the church is not by using methods to attract and add people. The building of the church requires consecration. If some have joined us because of our exhortation and attracting methods, we must be particularly careful. We need to ask the Lord to have mercy on them that they would be willing to pour out their hearts on Him. Our work in all the localities must be to lead people to consecration. Only in this way will there be the genuine building of the church. For example, if the motive of our love feasts is to add people, the saints eventually will cool down, even though they initially came because of the love feasts. Those who are added in this way have not passed through consecration; consequently, they will not last. We must be careful and pay attention only to consecration. The way to build up the church is through consecration, not human methods.</p>
