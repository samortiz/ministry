   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BACK TO THE HEAVENLY REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among today's Christians there is one legality after another.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All this legality results in division.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reason for this legality and division is that many have left the heavenly revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord's recovery is to bring us back to the heavenly revelation, to the heavenly formula.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because we have come back to the revelation, in the recovery there is no need for inferences, inventions, or discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not need to guess about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, we simply need to open our eyes to see the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we do this, we have the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are not in a maze, but on a highway under a clear sky, and we are directed by the heavenly revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE NEED FOR EYES AND LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to see this directing revelation, we need two things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, we need eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose the heavenly revelation is before us, but we do not have the eyes to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If this is the situation, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thank the Lord that we have eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Second, we need light.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are in darkness, we cannot see the heavenly revelation even if we have eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In such a case we would have the revelation, the unveiling, but not the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to have the vision we need the revelation, the eyes, and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise the Lord that we are not in religion, a maze, or darkness, but in a vision!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE EXAMPLE OF SAUL OF TARSUS</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider the example of Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although he was religious and very zealous for God, he was in the complex maze of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Judaism contains certain things that have been revealed by God, but the Judaizers have made issues out of them and have caused them to become legalities.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Revelation is of God, but legality is always made by man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Judaism had become a legality, this legality had become a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who are in this legality have found themselves in a maze and lost.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Often we get lost when we are driving a car, although we are confident that we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the case of Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although he was lost, he thought he was right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day on the way to Damascus, he was knocked down by the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that time onward he was delivered from the religious maze, and he began to travel on the highway of the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, he could tell King Agrippa, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision" Acts 26:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This vision had become his directory, the controlling element of his walk on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>NOT IN A MAZE, BUT ON THE HIGHWAY</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need such a heavenly directory today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today the whole human race and all of Christianity is a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All around us is a maze of inventions, discoveries, and philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do not have the heavenly vision, it means that we are already lost.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All the young people today are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have nothing to direct their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They do not know where they are going or what kind of life they should have.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Not only the young people, but people of all ages are lost in a maze of human inventions, discoveries, and religions.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one knows where he is going.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we in the Lord's recovery are not in a maze.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can boast in the Lord that I am not in a maze, but on the highway.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have a definite direction, I am under the heavenly directing, and I know where I am going.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The messages of this basic training are nothing other than the direction of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In message after message we shall see aspects of this directing revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Under the light of the heavenly vision, everything is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nothing is covered, opaque, or veiled, but although everything has been unveiled, we still need the eyes and the light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we have the revelation, the eyes, and the light, we can see everything.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When you were in Christianity, were you clear about the vision?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Please answer this question in a fair, sober, objective, and honest way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you were in Christianity, were you in the vision with a clear sky and a definite direction, or were you in a maze not knowing where you were going?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here in the Lord's recovery we are no longer in a maze; we are in the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not care for issues or legalities; we care only for the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hallelujah, we have the assurance that we are not in a division, but in the vision!</S>
