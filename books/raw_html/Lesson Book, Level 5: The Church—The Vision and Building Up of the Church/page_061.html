<h2 class=head4>d. The Church, the Body of Christ, the Corporate Christ</h2><p>[Ephesians 1:22-23 speaks of “the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.’’ The Body of Christ is an organism constituted of all the believers, who have been regenerated and have God’s life, for the expression of the Head. The Body is the fullness of the Head, and the fullness is the expression of the Head.<p>Because the church is the Body of Christ and Christ is the Head of the church (Col. 1:18), the church and Christ are one Body, the mysterious, universal great man, having the same life and nature and sharing the same position and authority. Just as Christ is far above all and sits in the heavenlies (Eph. 1:20-21), so also the church sits together with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6). Just as Christ has received all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18), so also the church participates in His authority (Luke 10:19). Today the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, and in the future the church will be manifested with Christ in glory (Col. 3:3-4). What Christ is, what Christ has, where Christ is, and what Christ does are what the church is, what the church has, where the church is, and what the church does. Christ is the life and content of the church, and the church is the organism and expression of Christ. The church receives everything from Christ, and everything of Christ is expressed through the church. The two, Christ and the church, are thus mingled and joined as one, with Christ being the inward content and the church, the outward expression.]<h2 class=head4>e. The Universal and Local Aspects of the Church</h2><p>[The truth concerning the universal and local aspects of the church also needs to be recovered. In a very real sense, these matters have been lost, even annulled. Therefore, we need to be recovered to the truth concerning these two aspects of the church.<p>In the universal aspect the church is uniquely one. This aspect of the church is revealed by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16:18, where He says, “On this rock I will build My church.’’ What is revealed here is the universal church for the unique testimony of the Lord in the universe.]<p>[In the local aspect the church is expressed in many localities as many local churches. The one universal church expressed in many places on earth becomes the many local churches. The expression of the church in a locality is the local church in that particular locality. Without the local churches there would be no practicality and actuality of the universal church. The universal church is realized in the local churches.]<h2 class=head3>3. To Build the Body of Christ, the Temple of God, the House of God</h2><p>[In the recovery of the church, we are building the Body of Christ, the temple of God, the house of God. This was typified by the rebuilding of the temple under the leadership of Ezra in Old Testament times. Today we are rebuilding the church life as God’s temple, the Body of Christ.<p>Ephesians 4:12-17 has much to say about the building up of the Body of Christ. Verse 12 says, “For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.’’ In this verse “unto’’ means for the purpose of, for, with a view to. The many gifted persons in verse 11 have only one ministry, that of ministering Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church. This is the unique ministry in the New Testament economy (2 Cor. 4:1; 1 Tim. 1:12). Furthermore, according to the grammatical construction of verse 12, “the building up of the Body of Christ’’ is “the work of ministry.’’ Whatever the gifted persons in verse 11 do as the work of ministry must be for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>The four special gifts in verse 11—the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherd-teachers—do not build the Body of Christ directly. Instead, these special gifts perfect the saints that they may build the Body of Christ directly. First, the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers perfect, equip, the saints. This means that they build up the saints. Then the perfected saints become the building members to build the Body of Christ directly. From this we see that the Body is not built directly by the special gifts but by all the members of the Body. If we realize this, we shall avoid the great heresy of the clergy-laity system. In the church there is no clergy or laity. On the contrary, in the church every member of the Body functions to build up the Body of Christ directly.]<h2 class=head3>4. To Establish the Kingdom Life</h2><p>[Finally, the recovery of the church involves the establishing of the kingdom life. This is indicated by Paul’s word in Romans 14:17. “The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.’’ This verse reveals that the kingdom of God is the living of the church. According to the context of Romans 14, the kingdom is today’s church life. The reality of the church life is the kingdom. Romans 12 speaks of the Body life and Romans 14, of the kingdom life. This indicates that, according to Romans, the kingdom life is the reality of the Body life.<p>The kingdom of God as the living of the church is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. When the authority of God’s kingdom operates in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life. To have such a living is to establish the kingdom life as typified in the book of Nehemiah by the rebuilding of the city of Jerusalem. Therefore, in the recovery of the church, we are building up the church as God’s house and city.]<h2 class=head1>CONCLUSION</h2><p>Although there were and still are many failures in the churches as well as the degradation of the church, the Lord is always recovering. He is never defeated or discouraged. He has an eternal plan. He will not change His mind because of problems. He will not stop until He finishes His work. Jesus said, “My Father is working until now, and I am working’’ (John 5:17). But He needs people to cooperate with Him for His recovery. Many Christians do not see what God is doing. Some have heard about His recovery, yet without the proper vision they have come and gone. May the Lord be merciful to us, to open our eyes to see His eternal purpose, the degradation of the church, and the failures in the churches, that we may remain in His recovery and not repeat history.<p>Pray like this, “O Lord! I see Your eternal purpose for the church. I see Your economy for the building up of Your church. I see Your recovery of the degraded church. I give myself to You for the recovering and building up of Your church until You come back for her. O Lord, keep me faithful until the end.’’
