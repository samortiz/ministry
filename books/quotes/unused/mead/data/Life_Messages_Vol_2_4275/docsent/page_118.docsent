   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For Receiving God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The heavens are for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without them the earth cannot exist.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The earth is for man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without it man cannot survive.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man has a spirit which is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God wants man to receive Him; that is why he was created.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If man had only a body, he would not be able to receive God who is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By creating a spirit in man, God made man with a part that corresponds to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 2:7 reads, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse indicates that man has three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His physical part was made of the dust of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the breath of life which was breathed into him became his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the body and the spirit came together, there was the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The body is for man's survival.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit is for him to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The soul is for man's self-expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of these three, the most important is the spirit, which came from the breath of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For Searching Man's Inner Being</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"The spirit of man," Proverbs 20:27 tells us, "is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the chambers of the soul" lit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>. The word spirit in this verse is the same Hebrew word as that translated breath in Genesis 2:7.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The breath of life which God breathed into man became man's spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Though this spirit is distinct from God, it is close to Him in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the spirit can receive God and also work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is a lamp, searching man's inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For Inwardly Governing Man</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Care for your spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the inner chambers of your soul must be controlled by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every country needs a central governing body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What is the central government in you?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sorry, I do not believe it is your spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the brothers come together, the central government is in control because they begin by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first few minutes of talk continue the atmosphere of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But before too many minutes have gone by, the central government collapses!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One brother expresses his opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Another says that the first is unfamiliar with the situation and therefore does not know how to handle it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first brother then wants to know what makes the second think he is so well qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is it right to heed your spirit when you pray, but disregard it when you talk to your brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Should it be your opinions which control you?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you are older, your opinions may not be so manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have been in the church life so long that your rough edges have been chipped off.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Outwardly you are smooth and agreeable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Inwardly, however, you are unwilling and dissatisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Dissatisfaction may be your central government.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the central government of the sisters, emotion holds the posts of president, prime minister, and chief of staff!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The spirit is useful when they pray, but when they are angry they feel they must give vent to their emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later they will repent, but at the time they give way to their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The central government of some saints is quick action.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without regard for the spirit, they make decisions, take action, and get things done, the quicker the better.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It seems that only when we pray is our spirit given its normal place.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as we finish praying, we in effect say, "Good-by, spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now that my praying is over, I don't need you any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I want to take care of things myself in my way."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This kind of attitude makes us like the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Neither they nor we are living by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Even the Lord has no way to control you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may say, "Isn't God almighty?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He should control me so that I don't lose my temper!"</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God controls you in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you do not contact Him, He cannot control you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord is like electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the current cannot get through to the outlet, you may have the lamp plugged in, but the light will not go on when you turn the switch.</S>
