<p>When the disciples came down from the mountain, the Lord Jesus charged them not to tell the vision to anyone (Matt. 17:9). Matthew 16 contains a revelation; Matthew 17 contains a vision. The revelation in chapter 16 concerns Christ being the Son of the living God. The vision in chapter 17 shows that Christ is God&rsquo;s beloved Son, God&rsquo;s delight, and that we should hear Him. It is one thing to receive a revelation, it is another thing to see a vision, and it is still another thing to be able to apply the revelation that we have received and the vision that we have seen. Peter received a revelation, but he was still confused when he saw the vision.</p>
<p>After the vision on the mountain, the Lord and His disciples went to Capernaum, and those who take up the temple tax came to Peter. The temple tax was collected from the people of Israel for the holy temple, not for the Roman Empire. Exodus 30:11-16 says that every male Israelite was to give half a shekel as a ransom for himself. The half-shekel was used for the service of the holy temple. To pay the half-shekel was to pay tax to God&rsquo;s temple, that is, to pay tax to God.</p>
<p>The collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and said, &ldquo;Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?&rdquo; (Matt. 17:24). This environment was arranged by God to expose whether or not Peter was clear about the vision that he had seen. Regrettably, when it was time to apply what he had seen, Peter completely forgot the vision. When he was asked, &ldquo;Does not your Teacher pay the temple tax?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; (v. 25) because from his youth he had been taught that in Exodus 30 Moses said every male Israelite should pay the temple tax. However, when Peter said yes, he was listening to Moses. From the time of Moses, generation after generation of the children of Israel had been listening to the word concerning every male paying the temple tax. Since Jesus was an Israelite, Peter assumed that Jesus would pay the temple tax.</p>
<p>After Peter said yes, he went into the house, and Jesus questioned him, saying, &ldquo;What do you think, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth receive custom or poll tax, from their sons or from strangers?&rdquo; Peter said, &ldquo;From strangers,&rdquo; and Jesus said, &ldquo;So then the sons are free&rdquo; (Matt. 17:25-26). In effect, the Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Did you not hear the voice on the mountain? I am the Son of God.&rdquo; When Peter heard the Lord&rsquo;s word, he might have thought, &ldquo;This must mean that He should not pay the temple tax. I am wrong again!&rdquo; The Lord then said to him, &ldquo;But that we do not stumble them, go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you&rdquo; (v. 27). I think that after Peter heard the Lord&rsquo;s words, he must have been at a loss. He might have thought, &ldquo;Lord, You are giving me a difficult time. You said that You do not pay the temple tax, but You also said that You would pay the temple tax. You are always right whether You say yes or no, but I am always wrong whether I say yes or no. Therefore, from now on, no one should listen to me; rather, we should listen to You!&rdquo; The voice on the mountain said, &ldquo;Hear Him!&rdquo; (v. 5). Peter should have told those who collected the temple tax that he needed to ask the Lord because he was told to hear Him. If Peter had replied in this way, he would have applied the vision that he had seen, and it would have spared him much trouble.</p>
<p>Peter created trouble for himself. After telling Peter that He would pay the temple tax, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Go to the sea and cast a hook, and take the first fish that comes up. And when you open its mouth, you will find a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and you&rdquo; (v. 27). Peter was probably very depressed when he went fishing. While the other disciples were in the house, he was sent to fish. When he cast the hook, he might have wondered when the first fish would come. He might have waited for a long time. In this way Peter learned a lesson. He probably regretted and thought that if he had not been so fast to express his opinion, he would not be waiting for a fish.</p>
<p>This example is simple; however, it presents the Lord Jesus as today&rsquo;s Moses, today&rsquo;s law. He is the living law. If He says that we should pay, then we pay; if He says that we should not pay, then we should not pay. Whatever He says, we should do. We should listen to Him. This example also presents the Lord Jesus as today&rsquo;s Prophet. We should not listen to anyone else; rather, we listen only to the living Jesus.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should despise or even neglect the Bible. However, the Bible does not give clear instructions concerning many things in our daily living. For example, the Bible does not say how long a sister&rsquo;s hair should be. It does not say how long her skirt should be. We cannot find an answer to these matters in any of the sixty-six books of the Bible. How should we handle these matters? We can ask the Lord Jesus. He is in us. He is our living law, our living Moses.</p>
<p>Not only so, He is the living Prophet, our living Elijah who prophesies. The Lord&rsquo;s prophecies are always fulfilled. When He says to go fishing, the fish will come. When He says to open the mouth of the fish and find a stater, it will be fulfilled. He is today&rsquo;s living Elijah. Hence, when we have the Lord, we do not need Moses or Elijah. When we have Jesus, we do not need anyone else. In the Old Testament a person had to find a way to pay the temple tax, even if he did not have money, in order to fulfill the commandment of Moses. However, the Lord Jesus, today&rsquo;s Moses, is not like this. When He asks us to pay the temple tax, He will provide a way for us. He says, &ldquo;Go fishing. When the fish comes, open its mouth, and you will get a stater.&rdquo; This is today&rsquo;s Elijah. His prophecy is His supply. Jesus not only gives us commandments, but He also prophesies to supply the demand of the commandment. As long as we listen to Him and do everything according to His word, the supply and the strength will come.</p>
<p>Our Lord Jesus is outside religion. We do not have religion, doctrine, or regulation. We have only the living Jesus. He is the living law, the living Moses, and the living Prophet, the living Elijah. We should listen to what He says and do whatever He asks. Then we will receive the supply. This is the Son of the living God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 18</div><br></body></html>
