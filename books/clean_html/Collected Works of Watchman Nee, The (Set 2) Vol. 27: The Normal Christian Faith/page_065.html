<h1 class="series">APPENDICES</h1><h1 class="msg">APPENDIX ONE</h1><h1 class="title">TOWARDS THE CHURCH</h1><p>Some people think that as long as one is a Christian, it is good enough; there is no need to be part of a church. Putting it another way, they want Christ but they do not want the church. It is fine to have individual prayers and Bible studies, but it is too troublesome for them to be related to other people. For this reason many Christians refuse to join any church. This is an unhealthy as well as erroneous concept among Christians. When a person has believed in Christ, not only does he have to negatively reject the world, but he has to positively be part of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">PART OF A WHOLE</h2><p>According to the Word of God, there is a corporate aspect to the Christian life. First, we are born into the family of God. We are children in this family. God's family is a big one, and we have to be children with many others. Second, all the redeemed ones are corporately a house for God's dwelling. God makes His abode here. Third, together we constitute the Body of Christ. Individually we are members of this one Body and are related to one another.</p><p>Hence, no matter from what angle you look, individual Christians are only parts of a whole. It is improper for us to be Christians individually without relating to others. Such an attitude cannot last for long and is damaging to growth. A Christian who takes such a stand will never be able to touch the riches of God or manifest the glory of the light of life.</p><h2 class="head1">BORN INTO THE BIGGEST FAMILY</h2><p>With this view in mind, we have to realize that we are not the only begotten son in this family. If my father has only begotten me, then I do not have to care about anyone else, because I have no brother. But if I have five other brothers and sisters in my family, then I cannot say, "I just want to be my father's son. I want nothing to do with the other five brothers and sisters. They are not my concern." I cannot do this.</p><p>Now that we are regenerated and have become Christians, we have to realize that we are born into the biggest family of the world. In this big family we have hundreds and thousands of brothers and sisters. The life we possess demands that we have fellowship with them. If there is no desire within you to visit other brothers and sisters or to shake their hands, I doubt that your regeneration is a genuine one.</p><p>The desire to regard the children of God as one's own brothers and sisters is something that comes from the life of God. It is something sweet and full of love. The nature of the life of God forbids us to be individual Christians. We cannot merely seek our own gain. We have to fellowship with all the children of God and live in this family of love, which is the church of God.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING STONES FOR THE BUILDING</h2><p>There are many big revelations in the book of Ephesians which relate to the church. In chapter two we see one of them&mdash;the church is the habitation of God. What God has been desiring for a long time is a habitation, or a dwelling place. Chapter two reveals that God's habitation is the church.</p><p>The church can be God's habitation because as individual Christians we are living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). But if the living stones are not built up together, there is still no habitation. An individual Christian may not be a dead stone; he may be quite living. But he is only an isolated stone. He is of no use in God's habitation; God can never dwell there.</p><p>This is not all. The new life within us urges us constantly to be built up with other stones. It will never be at ease or feel useful until we are built up into a spiritual house for God to dwell in. If we do not do this, we will feel that we are a piece of waste. I have to put myself into God's building. Because of me a gap is filled. When I am being built, I become part of the glory and majesty of this house.</p><h2 class="head1">MEMBERS OF THE BODY</h2><p>Ephesians 4 tells us that Christians are the Body of Christ. It also tells us that there is but "one Body." There is only one church in this universe. First Corinthians 12 says that "the body is one and has many members." This shows us even more clearly that we cannot be isolated or independent.</p><p>I am a Christian. I have been fully redeemed by the Lord and received the full grace of God. There is no doubt that I am a child of God. But in this huge Body, I am just a member. I may be a big member, a very useful one, yet I am still only a member. I am merely a part of the Body. I must depend on the other members. Together we become the Body.</p><p>For example, my body has eyes, a mouth, hands, and feet. All these are individual members. My eyes are useful only when they are in my head. If I leave them at home, they will become useless. My hands can only function when they are attached to my arms. If they are locked in a safe they are useless. The members can never be detached from the body. If they are detached, they become useless. This is a very crucial relationship.</p><p>Not only are the detached members useless, but they are ugly as well. If there was a human leg lying beneath this table, or if you picked up an arm on the road, how would you feel? It is impossible for you to be detached from the Body. The members cannot be independent. They must be attached together.</p>
