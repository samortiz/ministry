He initiated this new feast, which was for His believers' remembrance of Him, to replace the passover feast, the old testament feast for the elect's remembrance of Jehovah's salvation (Exo. 12:14; 13:3). This new feast of the new testament is for the remembering of the Slave-Savior through the eating of the bread, which signifies His body given for His believers (1 Cor. 11:24), and the drinking of the cup, which signifies His blood shed for their sins (Matt. 26:28). The bread denotes life (John 6:35), the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing (1 Cor. 10:16), which is God Himself as the believers' portion (Psa. 16:5). As sinners, the believers should have had the cup of God's wrath as their portion (Rev. 14:10). But the Slave-Savior drank that cup for them (John 18:11), and His salvation became their portion, the cup of salvation (Psa. 116:13) that runs over (Psa. 23:5), the content of which is God as the believers' all-inclusive blessing. Such a bread and such a cup are the constituents of the Slave-Savior's supper, which is a table (1 Cor. 10:21), a feast, set up by Him that His believers may remember Him by enjoying Him as such a feast. Thus, as His believers remember Him, they display His redeeming and life-imparting death (1 Cor. 11:26-His blood separated from His body declares His death), testifying to the entire universe of His rich and marvelous salvation.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
