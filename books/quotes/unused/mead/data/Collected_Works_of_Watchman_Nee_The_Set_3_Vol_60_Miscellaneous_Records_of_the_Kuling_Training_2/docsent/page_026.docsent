   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR HOW TO PREACH THE GOSPEL 5 Date: August 27, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Kuling STUDYING MAN'S HEART</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND LEARNING TO USE WORDS THAT HAVE "HOOKS" Creating a Feeling of Need in a Sinner</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man's heart is deceitful above all things; it is altogether in darkness and in opposition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A fallen man has no heart for God whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the testimony of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A fallen sinner belongs totally to this world and is totally sold to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He has nothing good to say about God's word whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, in order to preach the gospel to a sinner, our first objective should not be to make him understand the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, our first objective should be to help him grasp one or two of God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should create a feeling of need within him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our job is not merely to relate some gospel stories, truths, or news.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The purpose of our preaching is to create a sense of need for the gospel in a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not here merely to make him understand the gospel or to be clear about the doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even if he knows and understands the gospel in his mind, he still may not feel the need for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>TWO FEELINGS A SINNER MUST HAVE</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IN ORDER TO BE SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order for a sinner to be saved, he must have two feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first is a sense of need, and the second is a sense of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A gospel preacher's primary work is to stir up a sense of need and a sense of sin in man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In preaching the gospel to the Samaritan woman, the Lord did not first show her the gospel or her own sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He awoke a sense of need within her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She came to fetch water because she was thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus began by speaking about her outward thirst and went on to speak about her inward thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord kept stirring up a sense of need within the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, she said, "Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw" John 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the Lord did not give her a drink immediately, but instead asked for her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This awakened a sense of sin within her.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He pointed out her sense of need with the water and then led her to the sense of sin by referring to her husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the end she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every gospel preacher should read all the gospel messages in the Bible carefully at least once.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From these messages he should pick up the principles for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We know that every sinner dwells in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has no thought for God and surely does not want God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His thoughts are altogether in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to preach the gospel to him, we must first cast light upon the darkness of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should shed light on his thoughts through God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In announcing the Lord's redemption to sinners, our emphasis should be to create a sense of need within them for the gospel; we have to create such a need in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After they sense this need, we can explain the gospel to them in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In preaching the gospel, we must first cause our listeners to be dissatisfied with their present condition; we must impart a sense of hunger in them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They will want God's salvation only after a sense of need has been awakened in them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A sinner is in total darkness as far as his relationship with God is concerned; he cannot respond to God in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our job is to lead him to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in preaching the gospel we have to impart God's word into his heart with a very strong spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a consequence of this, God's word will not leave; it will take root in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then we can say what we want to say.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By lodging God's word within man, we have a handle with which we can pry open his heart and awaken a sense of need within him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A sinner is often saved by the kind of word we deposit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In preaching the gospel, we impart a thought within a sinner and then create a need within him based on this thought.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In His preaching to the Samaritan woman, the Lord made a few quick turns before bringing the woman to her salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, He created within her the sense of need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Next, He showed her her sins, and then she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our Lord is not only the Savior; He is a Savior who is good at saving.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No other person can preach the gospel as well as the Lord did in the four Gospels.</S>
