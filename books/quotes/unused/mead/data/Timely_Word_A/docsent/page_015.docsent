   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Many times you reach a point in your experience where you have genuine concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How can you have fellowship about these genuine concerns without being considered by others as negative and thereby causing another problem?</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, let us try to avoid any kind of trouble.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I see something in you that would not be so good for the recovery, I must pray for you and seek the Lord's leading to go to you and open up the matters of concern.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I should be able to do this without any kind of fear because we are brothers in the recovery, and we can fellowship about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I believe that all things have a way to be resolved by thorough and frank fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Please do not do things behind anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I did anything behind you, that would mean that I am not faithful to you or to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, if I am faithful to you, I am faithful to the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would never do anything behind you.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If there is some problem, I need to go to you to have some open fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today there are many people in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There are also a great number of co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We come from different countries with different backgrounds, and we have different kinds of understanding and thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To think that we would never have any trouble is a dream.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I should not do something behind my wife nor should she do something behind me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we do not avoid this, we will kill the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you feel or observe something concerning the Lord's recovery related to a certain person, you should pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not come to him in a rushed way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is still human, and you are still in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should be afraid of ourselves more than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should be afraid that we would do something in a rush to damage someone's feeling and close the door for open fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After praying for a period of time, we will feel led at the right time to go see this brother.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before we go to see him, we should not say anything to anyone because this kind of "pre-talk" opens the door for the devil to come in. If I have seen something about you that is not so fitting in the Lord's recovery, I should not talk about this to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I should pray to the Lord until He leads me to see you.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all have a heart for the Lord, and we all have the same goal to see that the Lord's recovery would be properly going on.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not feel that anyone is doing anything against me, and I am not against anyone, so we can have open, frank fellowship in love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even though I was so busy in Taipei, I believe that if some of the brothers had come to me to let me know about some of their problems, I might have rendered some help to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This may have required only two or three minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you come to me, you should come without fear.</S>

   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some may feel that they are afraid of disturbing me and taking away my time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when the troubles come as a result of not having the proper fellowship, my time is consumed with them.</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Your coming to me would save trouble, and to save trouble is to save time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When troubles like this arise, I receive many letters and phone calls.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the questions are concerning the past or the future.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why I want to stress that the Christian life is not in yesterday or in tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The past is over, and we do not know what will happen in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Christian life is today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should be frank and open, but we may feel in wisdom that we should not touch certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If I need to say something, I say it openly to the person whom it concerns.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I realize that more troubles will result from my touching a certain matter, then I exercise my wisdom not to touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If I have the real concern, I will pray concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I would not even tell my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have always kept this principle.</S>

   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I was with him for eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone who knows about our relationship can testify that we did not have the slightest problem.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because I practiced this principle, I have avoided becoming involved in troubles throughout the years.</S>
