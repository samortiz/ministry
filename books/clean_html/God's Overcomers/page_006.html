<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF THE CENTER</h2>
<p>Why are there all things? Why are there angels? Why are there human beings? Has God created these things without a purpose, or are they a part of God&rsquo;s plan?</p>
<p>Why did God choose man, commission the prophets, send the Savior, give us the Holy Spirit, set up the church, and establish the kingdom? Why would God want to spread the gospel to the uttermost part of the earth and save sinners? Why do we have to save sinners and edify the believers?</p>
<p>Some have considered baptism, speaking in tongues, forsaking the denominations, holiness, the keeping of the Sabbath, or other things as the center. But what is God&rsquo;s center?</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s work is with a goal. What is the goal of our work? We must first have a goal in our vision and then have a goal in our work. If we do not see God&rsquo;s center, our work will not have any goal.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s truths are all systematic and interrelated. There is a center to God&rsquo;s truths, and everything else is auxiliary.</p>
<p>Some have determined the center of their work by basing it on their own inclinations and the need around them. But our center should be according to God&rsquo;s predestination and His need.</p>
<p>What is God&rsquo;s center? What is God&rsquo;s consistent truth? What is the one line in God&rsquo;s truth?</p>
<p>Who is the Lord Jesus? We all say that He is our Savior, but very few people can say as Peter did, that He is the Christ of God.</p>
<p>The center of God&rsquo;s truths is Christ. God&rsquo;s center is Christ. &ldquo;The mystery of God, Christ&rdquo; (Col. 2:2). A mystery is something hidden in God&rsquo;s heart. God never told anyone why He created all things and why He created man. Hence, it was a mystery. Later He revealed this mystery to Paul and charged him to speak it out. This mystery is Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Son of God; He is also the Christ of God. When the Lord was born, an angel told Mary that He is the Son of God (Luke 1:35), but the angels told the shepherds that He is Christ the Lord (Luke 2:11). Peter acknowledged Him both as the Christ and as the Son of God (Matt. 16:16). When the Lord resurrected, He was designated the Son of God (Rom. 1:4). Through His resurrection, God also made Him both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36). A man receives life by believing that He is the Christ and the Son of God (John 20:31). In Himself, as far as His person is concerned, the Lord is the Son of God. In God&rsquo;s plan, according to His work, He was anointed by God and is, therefore, the Christ of God. He is the Son of God from eternity to eternity. He is the Christ since the beginning of God&rsquo;s plan. God&rsquo;s goal is for His Son to have &ldquo;the first place in all things&rdquo; (Col. 1:18). God&rsquo;s plan is focused on Christ. &ldquo;Christ is all and in all&rdquo; (Col. 3:11).</p>
<p>God created all things, and He created man for the purpose of expressing Christ&rsquo;s glory. Today believers express only a little of Christ. In the future all things will express Christ; the whole universe will be filled with Christ. God created all things so that all things will express Christ. God created man in order that man would be like His Son, having the life of His Son and the glory of His Son, so that the only begotten Son can become the firstborn Son among many sons. God created man and redeemed him for Christ. Redemption is for the purpose of reaching the goal of creation. Christ is the Bridegroom, and we are the friends of the Groom. He is the chief cornerstone, and each one of us is one of the millions of stones. God created us for the satisfaction of Christ&rsquo;s heart. We are thankful that we have seen the relationship between Christ and us. We praise Him because we have seen the relationship between God and Christ. God&rsquo;s center is Christ. God&rsquo;s goal is centered upon Christ. God&rsquo;s goal has two aspects: (1) that all things would express the glory of Christ and (2) that man would be like Christ, having the life of Christ and the glory of Christ.</p>
