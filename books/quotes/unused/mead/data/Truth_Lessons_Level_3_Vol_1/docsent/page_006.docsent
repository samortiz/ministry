At the end of the millennial kingdom, at the conclusion of the old heavens and old earth, all the dead who have not been saved through faith in the Lord Jesus will be resurrected and will pass through the judgment before the great white throne Rev 20:11-13 .

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the light of life, He dispels death, which belongs to darkness, and brings life to man, and He causes life to grow in His believers even unto full maturity, to the extent that they are exactly like God.</S>
