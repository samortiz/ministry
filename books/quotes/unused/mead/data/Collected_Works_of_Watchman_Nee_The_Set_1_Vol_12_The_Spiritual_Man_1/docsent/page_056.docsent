   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE CROSS AND THE SOUL THE CALLING OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus at least four times called His disciples to renounce their soul-life, to put it to death, to follow Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord knew that renouncing the soul-life is an absolutely indispensable requirement if man is to follow Him, to attain to perfect status, to be like Him in serving men, and to do the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although the Lord Jesus spoke about the soul-life in all these four callings, He had a special emphasis in each.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that the soul-life actually has various manifestations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the Lord spoke about the soul-life with diverse emphases.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Every disciple of the Lord must pay attention to the Lord's own words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord's calling is that man should hand his soul-life over to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE CROSS AND THE AFFECTION OF THE SOUL</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Matthew 10:38 and 39 the Lord Jesus said, "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These verses call us to lose our soul-life for the Lord's sake, to hand this life over to the cross to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Prior to these verses, the Lord Jesus spoke of how a man's foes are those of his own household, and how a son, for the Lord's sake, is estranged from his father, the daughter from her mother, and the daughter-in-law from her mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because God's will is at variance with the intention of our household, we must for the Lord's sake become estranged from our dearest ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to our soul-life, we love those whom we love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We like to obey them, and we are willing to act according to their desire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When our loved ones are happy, are not our hearts happy with them?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But here the Lord Jesus called us not to rebel against Him for the sake of loving man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God's will conflicts with man's wish, although that person is the one whom we love the most and who loves us the most, and although ordinarily we would feel painful and be most reluctant to break his heart, for the Lord's sake we should take up the cross to put our affections to death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of calling of the Lord Jesus is to rid us of our natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, He said in verse 37, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Luke 14:26 and 27 it is written: "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew shows the believer the choice he should make concerning his own affection: he should love the Lord more than his household.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke shows the attitude the believer should hold toward the love originating from his own soul-life: he should hate it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, this means that the believer should not have love toward others simply because they are the ones he would naturally love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is forbidden that I love others only because they are the ones I naturally love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even those as dear as parents, brothers, wife, and children are all included in this forbidden list.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of natural love is out of the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of natural love tends to cause one to be "glued" to others, to hold fast to those whom he loves, as well as to demand their love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord considers this soul-life as something that should be delivered to death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we cannot see the Lord now and our hearts still prefer to follow our loved ones and our life demands that we have some loved ones, the Lord desires that we have a loving heart toward Him whom we have not seen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He wants us to reject the love which comes out of our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus wants to rid us of all our direct love toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He does not want us to use our own love to love men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He desires us to love men not according to the natural liking in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such love of the natural man should be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now if we love others again, it is because we have a new relationship in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is only because of the Lord that we love.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not because of our own love for others that we love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should, for the Lord's sake, receive from Him His love to love others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In short, our love towards others should be under the regulation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the Lord wants us to, we should love even our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the Lord does not want us to, we should not love even the dearest one in our household.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord does not want our hearts to be attached anywhere; He wants us to serve Him freely.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If this is to be the case, the soul-life must be rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Obedience to Christ and disregard of human sentiment cause the believer's natural love to feel grief and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, such grief and pain become the believer's practical cross, enabling him through such a willingness to deny the self, to lose the soul-life related to the activity in the realm of love.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Oftentimes, to forsake one's loved one is heart-breaking and soul-hurting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many tears and sighings and much unspeakable sadness are produced because of the loss of a loved one.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All these bring sufferings to our life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How unwilling is our soul to deny our loved ones for the Lord's sake!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But it is thus by putting the soul to death being willing to die that the believers are able to break away from the soul's power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a loss of the soul-life's natural love on the cross enables the soul-life to let the Holy Spirit pour God's love into its heart before God, thus causing all the soul's love to be through God and in God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here we need to take note that this soul-life, humanly speaking, is legitimate and natural to possess; it is not filthy like sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Is not the love that has been mentioned commonly shared by all men?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Is it not legitimate to have the affection which loves one's household?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, the Lord's calling is for us to overcome the natural and, for God's sake, to renounce even man's legitimate right and be blended with God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God wants us to love Him more than Abraham loved Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Although the soul-life was given to man by the Lord of creation, God desires that men if willing not live according to this life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The worldly man cannot apprehend God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But when a believer advances gradually and loses himself in God's life, he will know God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Who can understand that God, having given Isaac to Abraham, also wanted him to give up Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But those who know the heart of God do not want to stop at God's natural gifts; rather, they desire to rest in the God who gives the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God's purpose is that we would be attached only to Him, not to any persons, things, or matters although these persons, things, or matters may have been given by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Christians are very willing to leave the Ur of Chaldea, but they seldom see the importance of offering on Mount Moriah what God has given.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is one of the deeper lessons of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is a lesson of entering into the life of God and being united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What God wants from His children is that they should forsake all and become His completely.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They must not only remove those things which they themselves realize and consider to be harmful, but they must also deliver their most legitimate human living, such as affection, to the cross and follow the direction of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What our Lord wants is very meaningful because man's affection is a function which is very difficult to control.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Unless the believer hands over this affection to the cross and is willing to lose it in death, he will be greatly hindered in the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Since human affairs often change, human affection is also influenced.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When the faculty of affection is stimulated, the whole being of the believer very easily loses its spiritual normality.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A believer who is soulish in this part will often be disturbed and lose the peace in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Sorrow, grief, lament, and tears are the usual results of affection.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If the Lord cannot have the first place in the matter of affection, it is hard for Him to take charge in other things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is a test of spirituality as well as a measure of its degree.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, we should hate our own life and not let it have any opportunity for free activity in exercising human love.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord's demand and our natural intention are completely opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What we love we must now hate.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Not only must we hate what we love, but we must also hate that faculty from which the love issues, that is, our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This then is the way toward spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we truly take up the cross in such a way, it will prevent the soulish affection from controlling and influencing the spirit and will enable us to love others by the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is precisely how the Lord Jesus treated His family when He was on the earth.</S>
