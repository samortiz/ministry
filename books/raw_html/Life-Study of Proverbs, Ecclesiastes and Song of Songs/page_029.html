<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>19. Concerning Prayers</H2><P>Whoever closes his ear to the cry of the poor man also will cry and will not be heard (21:13). He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination (28:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>20. Concerning Sacrifice</H2><P>To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; how much more when he brings it with evil intent! (21:3, 27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>21. Concerning the Praise from Man</H2><P>The refining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold, and a man is tried by the praise given him (27:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>22. Concerning Association with Others</H2><P>Make no friendship with a man who is given to anger, and with a wrathful man do not go (22:24). Do not associate with those who are given to change (24:21b). He who goes about as a gossip reveals secrets; therefore do not associate with one who opens his lips wide (20:19). Whoever keeps the law is an understanding son, but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father (28:7).</P>
