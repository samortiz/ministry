   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING THE LESSON OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The goal of our service is to bring the brothers and sisters into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we began our work in Taipei in 1949, the land for hall one of the church in Taipei was bought with the money of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later, with great effort we gradually built up the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1962, when I began the work in America, I did not bring any brothers with me; I simply took my Bible bag and left by myself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I left the brothers in Taipei with what I had labored on for over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now in 1984 I have returned, desiring with all of you to bring the church on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I admit that wherever I go, there are no peaceful days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To speak frankly, if anyone wants to have peaceful days, he should not come to listen to my messages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He should go to the denominations because it is very peaceful there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Year after year in the denominations, both those who preach and those who listen live peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord has not commissioned me to do this kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wherever I go, I work in such a way that no one is able to sleep peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The brothers who conduct the training are apprehensive that once my burden comes they will not be able to live peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is truly difficult to conduct the training in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On one hand, it needs to please the many elders in the churches, while on the other hand, it needs to satisfy the young people and also myself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the start of the training, there has been much gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have all heard the gossip, but no one has heard my voice.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A person who takes the lead in the Lord s work and the Lord s church must be like this; he must learn the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some who come from other places speak loosely regarding whatever they see.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They say that this is right and that is wrong, this is good and that is bad.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They speak this way because they have never learned the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first lesson of the cross is not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if we were the apostle Paul, when we come to the church in Taipei, we should first come and sit without saying anything.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a person is able to sit for twenty days, even four months, without saying a word, he would be comparable to Paul; such a one would be useful and able to accomplish something.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When some people go to a certain place, they begin to speak loosely and express their own views after having only been there for two weeks; this is to express their opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may use the example of riding in someone s car.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One who has truly learned the lesson of the cross does not have anything to say concerning the speed and condition of the driving when he rides in another person s car.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not comment whether the driver drives too slow or too fast, or whether the driver should make a left turn or a right turn, or go forward or back up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Willingness to say something proves that a person has not learned the lesson of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may have heard many doctrines concerning the cross, but when situations come, they manifest whether or not we truly know the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can tell how much a person has learned the lesson of the cross by his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One who has truly learned the lesson of the cross does not and dares not speak loosely; speaking is the touchstone of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If someone has truly learned the lesson of the cross, he will not speak loosely when he visits another place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To use the example of driving, only the driver should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are in someone s car, we should not say nonsensical things, such as, Your driving is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We do not need to speak, because we are not in our car and we are not the one driving.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Someone may go to Kaohsiung and say that Kaohsiung is good in a certain matter and not good in another matter; this shows that he has not learned the lesson of the cross and does not know the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We realize that the brothers and sisters serving full time in the churches are inadequate in many ways and that there is a need for some to perfect them properly; thus, we have picked up the burden to provide these full-timers with some training.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the training, we need to consider where we should send them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, when someone establishes a medical school or a department of medicine, there must be a hospital nearby that will cooperate with the school.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way, the medical students will have a place for internships.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without a hospital, the students will not have a place to practice what they have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For a medical school to be established, cooperation must be successfully established between a hospital and the medical school.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Similarly, the trainees cannot stay in the training center forever; they must go out and practically apply what they have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, we require that they go out to labor; in order for them to be able to labor, they must fellowship with the churches in their localities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the training fellowships with the churches, it demonstrates that what the training carries out is not for the training but for the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hope we can all see that neither the church nor various works are being merged with the training center.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This fellowship is so that all of us may learn the lesson that we are not a social organization that has private fellowships.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The churches should not take this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we take this way, we should permanently close down and do no more work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our concept must be utterly changed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to realize that we have been saved and regenerated, that we have been sanctified, and that we are in the process of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the same in regard to serving in the church; we must pass through regeneration, sanctification, and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We need to serve the church with such a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through this kind of fellowship and explanation, I believe that the brothers and sisters will have a deeper realization of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this period of time, if you have anything to say, you must be cautious.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not being careful can be likened to a household full of women whose gossip and criticisms are not fair.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is a saying in Chinese: Even an honest official cannot judge family affairs precisely.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No one can precisely judge the family affairs of the church; thus, we should not criticize so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to have an understanding of the training as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As for unintentional criticisms, we do not now know how to handle them, and we find it difficult to handle them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, we need to pay special attention to these matters.</S>
