<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONCLUDING NOTES TO CHAPTER FOUR</H2><P>1.The triune dispensing of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in the Father's choosing and predestinating, in the Son's redemption and transformation, and in the Spirit's sealing and pledging issues in bringing forth God's many sons, in producing a heritage of worth to God, and in the transfiguration, glorification, of the regenerated and transformed saints, which is the participation in God's sonship to the fullest. Such a triune dispensing unveils the rich details of the Triune God's dispensing. Yet it has not been consummated to its highest degree. It is the transmitting of the transcending Christ that consummates the divine dispensing to its highest degree. The dispensing of the processed Triune God has issued in the many sons of God, in the heritage of worth to God, and in our fullest participation in the divine sonship, but it has not yet issued in the church, in the Body of Christ. It is the transcending transmission of Christ that issues finally in the church as the Body of Christ. The many sons of God, the heritage of worth, and the divine sonship to its fullest extent are all for the church, the Body of Christ. Yet there is still the need of a consummation. The transcending Christ's transmission fulfills this consummation.</P><P>Since the transcending Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God, His transcending transmission includes all the rich dispensing of the Triune God. The Triune God's threefold dispensing is included in the transmission of the transcending Christ and is completed and consummated in the all-inclusive transmission of the transcending Christ.</P><P>2.Such an all-inclusive transmission brings us into the union not only with the incarnated and crucified Christ but also with the resurrected and transcending Christ. In union with this transcending Christ, we have surpassed all the negative things and transcended above them all. The incarnated and crucified Christ has brought God to man and has accomplished an eternal redemption for us. But the power of Hades and the rule, authority, power, and lordship in the air are still the frustration to the God-chosen people in their participation in what Christ has done for them in His new covenant. Through Christ's resurrection and ascension, Christ has conquered the power of Hades and surpassed and transcended above all the power of darkness in the air. In union with such a Christ, we are participating all the time in all His success in His resurrection and ascension.</P><P>3.The transcending Christ's transmission also brings us into Christ's heavenly ministry in His twelve statuses, as listed above, which He has attained and obtained in His ascension. What a rich source of the bountiful supply into which Christ's transcending transmission has brought us!</P>
