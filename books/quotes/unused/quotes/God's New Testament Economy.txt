God chose us, predestinated us, redeemed us, saved us, and regenerated us for the purpose of dispensing and working Himself into us
The full development of the revelation concerning God's intention to dispense Himself into us is in the New Testament
The word dispensation in these verses refers to God's economy, God's plan, God's arrangement, God's administrative dispensation
His stewardship was his dispensing duty to dispense Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God into God's chosen people
The second section was comprised of the Epistles, the letters written by the apostles from Romans through Jude
By this we can see that the New Testament shows us a Person as the Son of God, as the Spirit, and eventually as the seven Spirits
The chart on pages 12 and 13 is the consummation, final reaping, and extract of my fifty-nine years of studying the New Testament
In these verses, the Son went up from the water, the Spirit descended upon the Son, and the Father spoke concerning the Son
Many of us have held or even now hold this concept, unconsciously or subconsciously, that there are three Gods
Coexisting means to exist together at the same time, but coinhering means to exist within one another, to abide in each other
The complete God, the God of the Trinity, became flesh and lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years
Corinthians 15:45b tells us clearly that the last Adam, Jesus Christ, became a life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection
When the two disciples on the road to Emmaus realized that it was Jesus who was with them, He disappeared from them
Many saints have experienced the Lord's appearing to them when they were going somewhere or doing something against His wishes
Corinthians 1545b tells us that the last Adam Jesus Christ became a lifegiving Spirit and 2 Corinthians 317 tells us the Lord is the Spirit
The Epistles tell us clearly that the Spirit is the Son; He is also with the Father because the Father is always with the Son
We all are living Christ every day unto the fullness of God, which is the very expression of God, the Triune God
In the third section, Revelation, we see the seven Spirits out from the Eternal One, the One who was, who is, and who is coming
Jehovah in the Old Testament is revealed in Exodus 3 as the Triune God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
Also, the first of the Trinity is not the Father but the Eternal One, the One who was, who is, and who is coming
God the Son is revealed as the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth
The seven eyes, the seven Spirits of God, are Christ Himself watching over all the churches on this earth and observing their real situation
For the church to overcome today's dark age and the decline in today's Christendom, we need the seven-fold intensified Spirit of God
Now we have three words to describe the Triune God in the New Testament-embodiment, consummation, and intensification
The New Testament unveils to us how the Triune God became flesh in the Son with the Father by the Spirit to be a Man
As this Man, He lived on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, yet He did not live a human life; He lived in the human life
At the end of the four Gospels such a One in His resurrection breathed Himself as the pneumatic One into His disciples
Before His resurrection, the title 'the Father, the Son, and the Spirit' in Matthew 28:19 had never been revealed or used
The Word, which was God's definition and God's embodiment, needed to be embodied further in a Person, and this Person was God the Son
God was embodied in the Word before His incarnation , and the Word was embodied in a living Person who was the Man, Jesus Christ
Darby has a note in his New Translation on John 6:46 which also indicates that the sense in the Greek is 'from with'
Even in our experience today, when we call 'Lord Jesus,' we have the deep sensation that the Father is right in us
It was not until we received some 'theological help' that we began to address the 'Father on the throne' in heaven
When we pray in a spontaneous and intimate way to our dear Lord Jesus, we have a deep sensation that the Father is in us
While the Lord Jesus was speaking to Philip, He furthermore declared that the Father was in Him and that He was in the Father
When the Spirit entered into the womb of Mary, that was the essence of God the Father entering into the virgin
The Word's incarnation was the Triune God's incarnation-the Son of God, with the Father, by the Spirit became flesh
Initiation does not only convey the thought of beginning, but it also conveys the thought of beginning by creation
The Triune God's incarnation created a new thing, and this new thing created by the Triune God's incarnation was an initiation
Eventually, this new creation will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the center of the new heaven and new earth
The entire New Testament is an unveiling of such a unique Person who is the embodiment of the Triune God in a Man
Also in Genesis 18, the Lord Jesus came as a real man to Abraham, and Abraham prepared water for Him to wash His feet and fed Him
The Old Testament, the Gospels, Acts through Jude, and Revelation reveal to us the same wonderful Triune God-man
We must learn to know this Person, to describe this wonderful Person, and to present this excellent Person to others
The second item in God's New Testament economy is the Son's living on this earth, which is the continuation of the Word's incarnation
Dogs can like you or dislike you, and sometimes they get mad and bark at you, but this is still not the highest life
After the creation of man, God brought this man to the tree of life, showing that there was still a life that was higher than the human life
Today the kingdom of God should be the church life-the development of that wonderful living of two mingled lives
When He was twelve, He went to Jerusalem and He behaved, acted, and lived in a way that showed the divine life in a young human being
The incarnation of the Word was a dispensing that dispensed the Son with the Father by the Spirit into humanity
When this Man Jesus lived on the earth, He lived in a way that all the ones around Him saw the fullness of the Godhead
He inherited all that God the Father had because He lived as the embodiment of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Even when He was twelve years old He lived in a way that every one saw the fullness of the Godhead flowing out of Him
The incarnation was the dispensing of the Triune God into humanity, and the Son's living was the result of such a dispensing
We need a Savior, and a Redeemer, but why did our Lord need to live on this earth for thirty years, seemingly doing nothing?
Most were unlearned, some were fishermen, and then there were a group of women, one of whom was possessed by seven demons
Thousands of men possessing the divine life should follow this Man to live a life which is the result of the divine dispensing
Such a life accomplishes God's eternal purpose and has been set up as a pattern, a model, for all the Christians to live
In the previous chapters we have seen two basic items of God's New Testament economy: the incarnation of the Word and the living of the Son
It is mysterious, excellent, marvelous, and wonderful because it is the death of a mysterious, excellent, marvelous, and wonderful Person
The Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, is all wrapped up with this Man, so this Man was a Triune God-man
Besides these two factors, another factor is that there was an enemy, who is not only the enemy of God, but also the enemy of man
All the items in the universe became deteriorated through the invasion of death, causing everything to become old
He was God , even the embodiment of the Triune God , the aggregate of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit
To die for man, to accomplish redemption for man, He had to be a man with a man's blood since only a man's blood can redeem men
Praise the Lord that there was such a mysterious, excellent, marvelous, and wonderful One who was both God and man
In Genesis 3, however, this God-created man fell and in Genesis 6 this fallen man became the corrupted, fallen flesh through sin
Even though Christ was only in the likeness of the flesh of sin, we still must realize that this flesh was something related to sin
John 3:14 says, 'And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
In the eyes of God when Christ was crucified on the cross He was like a serpent only in form in likeness without the poisonous sinful nature
For Christ to be in the form of the serpent is the same as saying that He is in the likeness of the flesh of sin
The Bible also likens Christ to a serpent, but it does not mean that the Bible likens Christ to something having the poisonous nature
Some of us may still have a problem regarding the statement that Christ became flesh and in the flesh was Satan
The diagram on page 44 showing the sphere of the flesh with Satan as personified Sin in it according to Romans 7 may help us
It is quite alive and exceedingly active so it must be the evil nature of Satan the evil one dwelling acting and working in fallen mankind
If we saved ones are not on the alert, and do not watch and pray, this evil one can instigate us to do sinful things
Our flesh is not only flesh but sinful flesh, but the flesh of Christ, having nothing to do with the male, is not sinful flesh
The element of sin is in the sphere of the flesh below the dotted line, but not in the spot above the dotted line
In the sphere of the flesh below the dotted line is Satan, but in the sphere of the flesh above the dotted line is God!
During the thirty-three and a half years of the life of Jesus, Satan was fighting to get through the border line into the flesh of Jesus
When Christ went to the cross, He put the entire sphere of the flesh to death, which included Satan and sin, by injecting death into it
When Jesus the man was crucified on the cross, the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit were all involved
At this juncture, God left Him economically , just as God came to Him by the Spirit as power economically three and a half years previously
Whether God came economically or whether God left Him economically did not change His intrinsic essence or nature
The Triune God was involved with the conception of Jesus, with the living of Jesus on this earth, and with the death of Jesus on the cross
The efficacy of His redemption has to be secured by His divinity and it has been secured for eternity by Him as the Son of God
As the redeeming Lamb, He was foreknown before the foundation of the world , and was slain from the foundation of the world
In our eyes Christ died two thousand years ago, but in the eyes of God He was slain from the foundation of the world
In this death, sin is condemned, Satan is destroyed, the world is judged, and man with the flesh of sin is crucified
The Son's resurrection, which is the fourth item in God's New Testament economy, is even more mysterious than His death
After the millennium of a thousand years, there will be the third kind of resurrection-the resurrection of the dead and perished ones
In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus told us that He was a grain of wheat who came to this earth not to live but to die
Peter James and John treasured the Lord as a grain of wheat and when the Lord Jesus told them that He was going to die they were bothered
The Man Jesus was the shell of the grain and within this Man, this shell, were the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Luke 16 shows that with the poor man Lazarus and the rich man their body died, but their spirit and their soul went to Hades
According to these versions, when Christ died He was put to death in the flesh, but He was made alive by the Holy Spirit
Throughout the centuries, great teachers of different schools have had varying interpretations of these verses
In the conception of Christ, in the human living of Christ, and in the death of Christ, the Triune God was fully involved
The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh, which He received through incarnation , not in His spirit
Peter 3:18 is a crucial verse in the New Testament unveiling to us what was happening when Christ was dying on the cross
While a team of Roman soldiers was killing Him, another team, a team of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, was rising up from within Him
We must realize that when Christ was dying on the cross, He was dying as both the Son of Man and the Son of God
Christ had a body which was His flesh, and Christ had a spirit with the Spirit as His divine essence, which was the divine part of His being
His flesh was His human part with His human essence, and His spirit had the Spirit as His divine part with His divine essence
Peter 3:18 shows us that while Jesus was being killed on the cross, the Triune God as His divine essence was rising up in His spirit
In this way His resurrection was going on until the morning of the third day when His entire body was resurrected
There was no need for Christ to be designated as the Son of Man because when people saw Him they immediately recognized that He was a man
There was a need for Him to be designated the Son of God because the Son of God was concealed in Him as the Son of Man
While Jesus was being killed on the cross, the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, was making His spirit alive and strengthened
When His body was buried in the earth, His spirit went to proclaim God's victory over His enemy to the spirits in prison
By this He was fully designated the Son of God in power according to the divine Spirit out of the resurrection of the dead
The New Testament tells us that the Roman soldiers killed Him, but it also tells us that He Himself laid down His life
After His body was buried, His spirit with His divinity went to the abyss to proclaim God's victory over Satan to the disobedient spirits
After that proclamation, He came to His killed and buried body and His resurrection invaded and raised up His body
The New Testament tells us that Jesus Himself rose from among the dead, and it also says that God raised Him up
When He was standing in the water after baptism, He was the Mighty God; the Mighty God was the essence of His being
When He was nailed to the cross, that was the Mighty God being put to death since God was His intrinsic essence
When He was being raised from among the dead, He was God rising up; the very God Himself was the intrinsic essence of this rising up One
Since the Triune God was the intrinsic essence of Jesus, the intrinsic essence of Jesus was also resurrection itself
Today He is not merely the only begotten Son of God, but He is also the Firstborn of God, and we are His many brothers
In His resurrection, as the Son of Man, He was born of God, that is, divinely sonized to be the firstborn Son of God among many brothers
To answer this question we must first see the verse which tells us that Jesus Christ was born to be the Son of God
Jesus Christ is the firstborn Son of God possessing the divine and human elements, and His human element has been divinely sonized
We, as human beings, were all divinely sonized through His resurrection to be many sons of God to participate in His divine sonship
According to our physical life we do not have that many years, but according to our spiritual life we were regenerated that many years ago
All of us should declare, 'I am a part of the new man through the wonderful death and resurrection of the Son of God'!
He became the firstborn Son of God, He brought forth His many brothers, and a new child was born through His resurrection
As the life-giving Spirit He has come into us to apply to us all that He has achieved, accomplished, attained, and obtained
His incarnation becomes ours, His human living becomes ours, His crucifixion becomes ours, and His resurrection becomes ours
His being the firstborn Son of God becomes ours, His producing many brothers becomes ours, and even the birth of the new child becomes ours
Essentially, the Spirit was breathed into His disciples, and economically, such a Spirit was poured out upon His disciples
Now within His disciples is the Spirit of life essentially, and upon His disciples is the Spirit of power economically
After the disciples had received the Holy Spirit intrinsically as their essence they began to be with the Spirit as the Son with the Father
14:16-20 show us that the other Comforter to be given was the reality of the Comforter who was asking the Father
The Comforter was there talking to the disciples and was there asking the Father to give them another Comforter
He had come already to be with them, but He could not get into them, so He had to have a further coming to enter into them
On the day of resurrection the disciples would know that the Lord was in the Father, that they were in Him, and that He was in them
They would also realize that they were in the Son, the Son was in the Father, and the Son with the Father was in them
The ambiguity of John 14:26 shows us that the Son is both the Father as the Sender and the Spirit as the Sent One
The main point in these verses is this: the Spirit will be sent as the Son, and the Spirit will come with the Father
These two verses show us that the Sender is both the Father and the Son, and the Sent One is the Spirit as the Son with the Father
The Spirit is only the Sent One as the Son with the Father; thus, He is the consummation of the divine Trinity
In the first section of God's New Testament economy, we saw the Son with the Father by the Spirit, who was the embodiment of the Triune God
The One who is in the church is the wonderful Spirit as the Son with the Father to be the consummation of the Triune God
When this Spirit comes to us as the Son, He comes with all that the Son has accomplished, attained, and obtained
He also accomplished an all-inclusive death, an excellent and marvelous resurrection, and an exalting ascension
The third heaven must refer to the heaven of the heavens , the highest heaven , where the Lord Jesus and God are today
In addition to His attainments, Christ obtained the kingship, the lordship, and the headship, including all authority
We must remember that when the Spirit comes into us as the Son, this includes all the Son's accomplishments, attainments, and obtainments
The divine title of the Father, especially in the New Testament, comprises His plan, His selection, His predestination, and His glory
These three things are related to three persons sin is related to Adam righteousness is related to Christ and judgment is related to Satan
The sinners who are born in Adam must believe in the resurrected Christ so that they may have Him as their righteousness
When the gospel is preached in a proper way those who hear would have the desire not to remain in Adam, but to be transferred into Christ
To them, the convicting Spirit will become the regenerating Spirit , the Spirit of life , the Spirit of reality, dwelling within them
The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us
We have received everything that the Triune God is and has, but we have been too veiled to see and experience what we have received
These verses unveil to us the transmission of the divine Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit into the believers
In John 7:37-39 we are told clearly that such a Spirit of life, which is the living water, 'was not yet because Jesus was not yet glorified'
John 20:19-22 shows us that on the evening of the day of resurrection He came to His disciples as such a Spirit
After He had accomplished all of His processes, He became the life-giving Spirit , and this life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ
All those natural disciples, through that breathing on the day of resurrection, received the Spirit of the divine, uncreated life of God
They became persons not living by themselves but by the Spirit, persons one with the Triune God intrinsically in their essence
Such a One, the pneumatic Christ as the Spirit, came back to His disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them
In resurrection He was born as the Firstborn of God , and at the same time He brought forth many sons of God who are His many brothers
On the day of His resurrection He came back to the disciples as the pneumatic Christ and He breathed Himself into them as the Spirit of life
In this breath are all the elements of the Person of Christ and all the elements of what He has accomplished, attained, and obtained
On the evening of the day of resurrection the Lord exhaled Himself as the breath and the disciples inhaled Him as the breath
We must thank the Lord that in these last days He has taken away the veil to disclose to us all these things in such a detailed way
He trained them to know that He had become them, that He had entered into them, and that He had brought them into Him
They were no longer separate from the Triune God, but they could now live a life in which they were one with the processed Triune God
They were no longer merely men, but God-men, divine men, with the Triune God as their intrinsic essence to become their divine being
They had to be trained to practice this presence, to live and behave in this life, and to be persons in this life
No matter where they were, where they went, or what they did, they could not be separated from Him because He was mingled with them
In the morning , which was not the right time for fishing, they caught an abundance of fishes when they did it at the Lord's word
After the resurrection, however, as the pneumatic Christ and as the life-giving Spirit, He came back to the disciples and entered into them
He was one with His disciples intrinsically and essentially, but the disciples were not used to such an invisible presence
Because of their weakness, He appeared to them and disappeared in order to train them to realize His invisible presence
He wanted them to know that even though they did not see Him or feel His presence, He was still there with them all the time
They were trained to fully realize that this wonderful Person was so real and that He was with them, even within them
The two sons of thunder, James and John, begged the Lord Jesus to give them the two top positions when He came in His kingdom
They were not only regenerated, but also transformed persons to some extent, so they could pray together in one accord for ten days
They were under this kind of death threatening, yet they dared to stay there and pray for ten days, and they prayed in one accord
They cared for the Lord's commission, for the Lord's testimony, , and for the preaching in His name of the gospel
There was a wonderful scene in the universe which should have been seen by the angels as the spectators on the day of Pentecost
On the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out from the Head and by the Head to the disciples and on the disciples
What was needed on the day of Pentecost was not life, but power, even the mighty power to carry out God's administration
After the blowing of the mighty wind, those one hundred twenty became not only spiritual persons, but heavenly persons
They joined the heavens and the earth, and they were cooperating with the heavenly Head to carry out God's eternal administration
On the day of resurrection, He was the all-inclusive breath which was breathed into His disciples as the Spirit of life
On the day of resurrection, the resurrected Christ, as the all-inclusive breath, was breathed into the disciples
On the day of Pentecost, the exalted Christ, the authorized Christ, as the mighty wind, was blown upon these ready believers
From His incarnation through His resurrection, He became this Spirit of breath, which is for life intrinsically and essentially
The life-giving Spirit, who is still God's Spirit, the Holy Spirit, is the pneumatic Christ, the resurrected Christ
Even though we have been filled with life essentially, we still are not qualified to come to the meeting to speak something for the Lord
When a person is driving his car and he sees a man with a police uniform, he becomes very careful in his driving
The book of James tells us that Elijah prayed that it should not rain and it did not rain on the earth for three and a half years
Elijah had a mantle, and that piece of clothing was his uniform, his authority, to control the heavens for God's administration
The disciples were charged by the Lord to wait in Jerusalem until such a mantle, such a uniform, would descend upon them
The Bible tells us that Christ ascended into heaven , but it also says that he was taken up and exalted by God
The Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, was fully involved with the ascension and the pouring out of the Spirit
In His ascension He obtained the kingship , the lordship , the enthronement , the headship , and the glory and honor
We have the Triune God in His humanity with His human living, His all-inclusive death, and His excellent resurrection within us as our life
When we say the economical Trinity, we mean the divine Trinity in His economy, referring to His move, work, and function
Eventually, they became persons of the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God
Although Christ as the Head of all things is the authority and the government of this universe, He needs a Body to execute His orders
In this Body and joined to our ascended Head, we have the power, the authority, and the entire universe must respect us
As the resurrected, pneumatic Christ, the Lord dealt with all the negative items in the universe and released Himself into us as our life
Another step was needed for Him to be exalted to be the authority of the universe, to be the ascended, exalted Christ
He poured Himself out as the exalted Christ upon us as authority to make us His Body, the executing organ of the Head
The same one Spirit as the Spirit of life germinates us, and as the Spirit of power brings us into a new kingdom
All the believers of Christ are Spirit germinated persons, and also persons brought into a new kingdom by the Spirit
We have to be germinated by the Spirit of life essentially, and we have to be empowered by the Spirit of power economically
As long as we have been first germinated and then baptized, we become members of Christ and are composed into the one Body of Christ
When the Lord poured Himself out as this all-inclusive consummated Spirit upon His disciples, He accomplished the baptism in the Spirit
To be baptized is to be put into Christ and to put Christ upon us ; then we begin to drink of Christ and to take Him in
The breathing of Himself into the believers has been accomplished, and His baptizing the believers in the Spirit has also been accomplished
We become one with the Triune God, and whatever He is and has is ours because we are organically united to Him
Once the church gets involved in politics, the church loses its nature as the Body of Christ and becomes no church
History tells us that when the church became involved with politics it turned into the Roman Catholic Church, which is no church in reality
The history of the world throughout the past twenty centuries shows us that actually there was an invisible ruler above the scene
The direction of the situation of the world today depends upon how the genuine church, the proper church, is proceeding on this earth
The ascended, exalted Christ carries out His administration by the seven Spirits as the lamps of fire through the churches as the lampstands
After the ascension and exaltation of the Savior the disciples went out to preach the gospel to the whole creation
The disciples went and discipled the nations not merely by preaching the Word, but even more by exercising the authority of the Head
The genuine tongue speaking is the issue of the power and authority of the ascended Christ to overcome the divisions of mankind
In the Lord's salvation, by the exalted Head, tongue speaking overcomes the divisions of mankind caused by different dialects
From His incarnation to His ascension the allinclusive Christ accomplished many things He attained many things and He obtained many things
Today we are still living in the old age which is full of demons, sickness, death, division, and problems and troubles
These are new persons of mankind who have been brought into a new realm, a new kingdom, which is the kingdom of God
That will be the time of the 'restoration of all things' referred to in Acts 3:21, the kingdom of peace and righteousness on this earth
In 1969 five brothers who meet with us went to a Pentecostal, charismatic meeting where there was much 'speaking in tongues'
When these five brothers went into their meeting, the pastor and his helpers were attempting to cast out a demon
Within we are intrinsically, essentially one with the Lord, and without we are economically one with Him in His governmental administration
The genuine church, the church that is one with this ascended Head, is one with Him in the inner life and one with Him in the outer economy
All of the items listed in Mark 16:17-18 are the display of the governmental authority of Christ's administration
We must realize that not all the things mentioned in Mark 16 happened at the same time or happened to everyone
Acts 19:12 tells us that God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul so that even handkerchiefs from him could heal people
They would even try to imitate Paul by putting their hands on a handkerchief while praying for their sick friend
Paul and his co-workers were under the exercise of the inner life in this time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift
In the decline of the church and in suffering for the church, the gift of power is not as much needed as the grace in life
John 22324 says When He was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did
Our primary enjoyment that we have in the all-inclusive Christ in the New Testament age is as the milk and as the solid food
These are miraculous, supernatural things which will be fully manifested in the coming millennium, the age to come
Our natural being is being transformed into a divine being not by outward change, but by an inward, metabolic change by the divine life
Finally, we shall be like God and have the same image as God , being changed from glory to glory to enter into God's glory
In contrast to the New Testament blessings we can enjoy in this age, there are the works of power of the coming age
We must ask ourselves which category of blessings we prefer today-the New Testament blessings or the blessings of the coming age?
Many Christians have no realization of the New Testament blessings but are seeking after the miraculous, outward signs
The Lord Jesus did not heal him and did not perform any miracles, but He told him that he needed to be regenerated, to be born again
The first thing accomplished in God's New Testament economy concerning the Spirit in the book of Acts was the baptism in the Spirit
One happened on the day of Pentecost when the one hundred twenty were baptized , and the other was in the house of Cornelius
All the Jewish believers need to realize that they were baptized in the Spirit on the day of Pentecost with Peter and the one hundred twenty
On the day of Pentecost, the one hundred twenty disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues
In Acts 4:31 Peter and his company were filled again with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness
Paul experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit for the first time when he was filled with the Holy Spirit right after his conversion
According to the record of Acts, this was Paul's second time to be filled outwardly, economically, with the Holy Spirit
There are three extraordinary cases of believers being filled with the Spirit outwardly which we must investigate
Peter and John's laying on of hands upon these Samaritan believers confirms that they were added to and accepted by the Body of Christ
Peter and John, who represented the Body of Christ, identified them with the Body of Christ and imparted what the Body of Christ had to them
All of the church people were afraid of him, but the Lord met him on the road to Damascus and saved him directly
After they received the complete gospel, Paul laid his hands upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied
All of these believers received the Spirit upon them, not directly from the Head, but indirectly through the Body
Those who were filled with the Spirit outwardly for power, being baptized into one Body, began to drink of one Spirit
After we have been baptized into the Spirit outwardly, we keep drinking of the Spirit and become full of the Spirit inwardly
As a result, they moved, walked, worked, acted, traveled, and did everything by the Spirit as men of the Spirit
In the Acts we see a group of people on this earth filled with the Spirit inwardly for life and outwardly for power
They were persons of the Spirit, having the divine life within essentially and possessing the divine power economically
These members, who form the Body of Christ, have been regenerated and possess God's divine life and God's divine nature
These members are put together into a Body to express Christ, and this Body is manifested in many localities as the local churches
The Spirit of God in Romans 8:9 now dwells in the tripartite man and is now the Spirit of Christ who possesses humanity as well as divinity
In Genesis 1 the Spirit of God had not yet gone through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
All these elements are compounded with the Spirit of God, who is no longer outside of us but inside of us to dwell in us
He is Jesus, the Redeemer, our Savior, our sanctification, righteousness, holiness, life, light, and everything
There would be no need to read it two or three times since you would immediately be impressed with these miraculous things
The reason for this is because even without reading such a book, all these things are already in our natural mentality
In Romans 8:9 the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are synonyms which are interchangeably used with a particular significance
You may call this Person Christ; you may call Him the Spirit of Christ; and you may call Him the Spirit of God
Far, we have seen the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and now we come to the Spirit of Him
After Paul referred to the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of God, he referred to the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead
To apprehend the title 'the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead' requires much understanding
The Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, Christ Himself, and the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwell in us
The one who is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ Himself is the One that raised Jesus from among the dead
Day after day the divine life is spreading into our body until that day when our body will be redeemed and transfigured
As believers our spirit has been regenerated and our soul with its leading part the mind is now under renewing which is our transformation
We were enemies of God, but such a wonderful, divine work by the consummation of the Triune God is making us sons of God
While they were on their way to the movies, there was something within witnessing and saying, 'Don't forget that you are a child of God'
Sometimes while a husband is losing his temper with his wife there is also a witnessing- 'Don't forget that you are a child of God'
The foretaste of the coming age is the taste of the outward things, but the firstfruit is the foretaste of the processed Triune God Himself
The Holy Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, is the firstfruit of all the riches of God's being for our enjoyment
The interceding Spirit helps us, sympathizes with us, sustains us, comforts us, and supports us by interceding for us
Eventually, such a Spirit becomes a mingled spirit, the Spirit mingled with our spirit , according to whom we walk
The kingdom of God which is todays church life is of righteousness with ourselves peace toward others and joy with God in the Holy Spirit
Do not think that the kingdom of God is for you to be a king to rule over others and to execute God's government
The very Christ we see in the four Gospels is now the 'pneumatic Christ,' the all-inclusive Spirit, in the Epistles
In the two sections of the Gospels and the Epistles in the New Testament, we see the same Person in different aspects
What we see in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament is altogether just one wonderful, all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous Person
Corinthians 15:45, however, is the only place in the New Testament which specifically says the 'life-giving Spirit'
The title of the life-giving Spirit, though, indicates that the Spirit of life is moving, working, and imparting life
The bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life; the living bread refers to the condition of the bread, which is living
On the other hand, the life-giving Spirit denotes the same Spirit moving, working, and living in us to impart life into us
You may have the all-inclusive Christ, but the Christ in you may be nearly nothing to you because He is so 'calm' within you
There is the need of someone who is so active and so living to come to search, to stir up the Christ within you
The main work of the life-giving Spirit is to search Christ, to stir up Christ within us concerning these nineteen items
The Spirit that gives life is searching Christ to stir up this Christ in our love, pursuit, and experience of Him
Even the Jewish religion, which was founded according to the Old Testament, never tells others that God dwells in His people
After a while, though, when our church life honeymoon was over, we began to consider that the church life was not really that good
You may not want to go to the meetings because in the meeting you will see a certain brother whom you feel unpleasant about
We must realize that there is not one elder who is so perfect that he can stand the 'sharp watching' and observing of the saints
In the entire human race, only one man is so perfect who can stand the test of people's watching and observing
The washing cleanses us, and the washing by the life-giving Spirit always brings us back to being joined to the Lord as one Spirit
The life-giving Spirit is occupying the body of the believers, which is the temple of God, for God's glorification
We should not let our feet and our legs take us to sinful places, but they should always take us to the meetings of the church
We should always live in this reality-whatever is outside of us is the Spirit and whatever is inside of us is the Spirit
Far we have seen that the first Epistle Romans is on the Spirit of life and the second Epistle 1 Corinthians is on the lifegiving Spirit
In the first Epistle to the Corinthians we see the growth in life, with the indication that this growth is for transformation
The word transformation is not used in that chapter, but the issue of the growth in life is there indicating transformation
We need not only to grow in life but also to be transformed in life that we may become the precious materials for God's building
In the first Epistle growth in life issues in transformation, and in the second Epistle transformation is the result of the growth in life
Corinthians 1:21-22 shows us that this transforming Spirit is the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging Spirit
As the current of water flows through a piece of driftwood it carries away the old elements and brings in the new elements of minerals
All these elements are carried into our being by the transforming Spirit, and these elements become the factors of our transformation
The Holy Spirit, who is the transforming Spirit, is sealing us all the time, and this sealing makes a mark which people can read
The sealing does the same thing, but it also forms the divine elements into an impression, a mark, to express God's image
The foretaste gives us a taste of God; this is also a pledge, a security, a guarantee of the full taste to come
The transforming Spirit, however, involves the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging of the elements of Christ into our being
The composition of Christ is altogether done with the Spirit, and the Spirit is the element of the composition of Christ
We must realize that the New Testament ministry is one with the transforming Spirit, and that this ministry is a transforming ministry
When we are listening to a person whose speaking is the New Testament ministry, the transforming Spirit is transforming us
These two actually work together as one to impart more and more divine elements into us for our transformation
Even though one was diseased or hungry, nothing could be done for him on the Sabbath, nor could he do anything for himself
Today, however, is not the age of Moses and the law in letters but the age of the Lord Jesus being the 'pneumatic Christ'
With Him there is no more bondage, no more Sabbath, no more circumcision, no more dietary regulations, but there is full freedom
We are being transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory, from glory to glory
In this fellowship we are enjoying the rich elements of the Triune God, which are the elements for our transformation
Day after day, more and more, the rich elements of the Triune God are being added into our being and we are being transformed
During the time that Paul wrote this book, the Christians were being bothered, troubled, and distracted by the law keepers, the Judaizers
These law keepers or Judaizers, on the one hand, pretended to be Christians, but they still remained so faithful to Moses
In the first two chapters Paul presented the Galatians with a clear view that God's intention is to work Christ into us as everything
The law is also likened to a sheepfold , in which God's chosen people were kept and guarded in custody and ward until Christ came
In chapter two Paul goes on to show us that Christ replaces the law and that God did not want us to keep the law
We have nothing to do with the law since the obligation under the law, the relationship to the law, was terminated in Christ's death
Paul called them foolish Galatians and he asked them, 'Did you receive the Spirit by the works of law or by the hearing of faith'?
By receiving the gospel, the Galatians received the consummation of the Triune God which is the living, all-inclusive Spirit
In Galatians 3:16 Paul shows us that Christ is the unique seed of Abraham that brings the blessing to all the nations
Paul was telling the Galatians that the law did not bring any blessing to them but it only put them under a curse
Christ came and died on the cross to redeem us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf
When He was hanging on the cross wearing a crown of thorns, this indicated that He was made a curse on our behalf
When Paul said, 'that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith,' he changed the nations to 'we'
The blessing of the gospel is that we might receive the promise of the Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God
The blessing of the gospel is the Spirit, who is the sum total and the aggregate of the Triune God; the processed Triune God
He is the processed God consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit, ready for you to receive and enjoy, but you have to believe
In Hong Kong, a city famous for selling jewels, the salesmen have a special art of showing someone these precious things
Also, when we review what we have seen when we were under the speaking of the ministry, that review will supply us with more Spirit
The very divine Spirit within us today is the Spirit of the divine Son, so He is the reality of our divine sonship
When you are going to a movie, He goes with you, but He goes with you indicating that you should not go further
The real situation of every marriage life is that there is always the tendency and the temptation to exchange words with each other
Do not go by the Spirit in great things first, but go or walk by the Spirit in small things first, such as talking on the telephone
When many saints, especially the sisters, talk on the telephone, it seems as if they do not have the Lord Jesus or the Spirit within them
Maybe during one phone call the Lord Jesus would tell you to stop your talk many times but you would tell Him-'just one more sentence'
To sow unto the flesh is to sow for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets
To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires
In the Epistles of Ephesians and Philippians we see the Spirit, as the Son, with the Father, being the consummation of the Triune God
After the Triune God had gone through a marvelous process, the consummation came out, that is, the all-inclusive, processed, compound Spirit
Ephesians 1:13 tells us that we believers, who are the components, the members of the Body, have all been sealed with the Holy Spirit
Ephesians 1:13-14 tells us that when we heard the Word and believed in the Lord Jesus, we were sealed with this compound Spirit
When a person buys a new book and stamps or seals it with his name, this seal denotes that the book belongs to him
The Holy Spirit put the divine element into our being as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God
The divine element added into our being the mark made in us and the indication of the divine ownership when added together become a pledge
When the riches are in God Himself they are His riches, but when the riches of God are expressed they become His fullness
To apprehend the breadth length height and depth the unlimited dimensions of Christ requires all the saints not individually but corporately
No one can tell how broad is the breadth, how long is the length, how high is the height, and how deep is the depth
When Christ makes His home in your heart, occupying your entire inner being, this means that Christ is filling you with all His riches
The heart is a composition of our inner being, consisting of the mind, the will, the emotion, and the conscience
When Christ with all His unsearchable riches makes home in our heart, this means that He is occupying every part of our inward being
Ephesians 4:30 tells us that the members should not grieve the Spirit, in whom they were sealed unto the day of redemption
Since the day of our salvation, unto the day of the redemption of our body, this sealing is always taking place
The antecedent of which is Spirit, not sword, indicating that the Spirit is the Word of God, both of which are Christ
When we have the Spirit with us, the Spirit with us makes the black and white dead letters the living Word of God
In Philippians 1:19 the Apostle Paul uses a special expression-'the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ'
The first mention of the Spirit is in Genesis 1:2 which tells us that the Spirit of God brooded upon the death waters
Through the marvelous processes which the Triune God has gone through, many elements were added to this 'water'
In marriage life, if either the husband or the wife gives the other a long face, the other party forgets about Christ
It takes the strongest power, the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, to deal with this small thing
The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is for us to live Christ and to manifest Him in death or in life, in prison or in freedom
If God says, 'Let there be no movie,' many believers still desire to go to the movie, so God has to operate within them
Today however we need a practical present salvation to save us from our temper our long face our gossiping and our going to the movies
We have to experience and enjoy Christ and be found, be seen, and be discovered by others that we are living in Christ
We should be those not having our own righteousness but having Christ as God's righteousness expressed from within us
In this Triune, processed God as the life-giving Spirit, we are empowered to do all things for expressing Christ
In Titus we see the maintenance of the order of the church, and Philemon is an illustration of the believers' equal status in the new man
After going through the process of incarnation human living crucifixion and resurrection this One became the allinclusive lifegiving Spirit
Ephesians is a book on the Spirit of the Body, and Philippians is a book on the bountiful Spirit of Jesus Christ
The Spirit in Colossians is revealed as the source the element and the sphere of the believers love toward all the saints in Christ the Head
According to our natural understanding the matter of love is common, but according to the divine fact it is not common
How can different peoples with different tongues of different races and of different colors be one Body and be one new man?
Many would say that Christianity is a religion of universal love, but actually our human and natural love is not universal
There is a love, however, that we Christians have in the Spirit which loves all the different members of the Lord's Body
If you live in Him, He is the universal love that causes you, makes you, and stirs you up to love all the unlovable saints
In 1 Thessalonians 4:3-8 we see that the Spirit is given by God to the believers for sanctification versus fornication
You may be very moral, very ethical, very pure, very clean, and living for others, but you still may not be holy
You may be good, moral, ethical, pure, and kind, but if you are not for God you are not holy; instead you are common
Fornication is to use the body for something other than God, while sanctification is to use the body absolutely for God
When you exchange words with your wife or husband, you have to realize that in principle this is committing spiritual fornication
Thessalonians 4:3-8 is a strong portion of the Word telling us that sanctification in the Spirit is versus fornication
In 2 Thessalonians 2:13-14 we see salvation in sanctification of the Spirit unto the obtaining of the glory of Christ to express God
God chose us unto salvation, but the salvation referred to here is not the salvation from perdition or from God's condemnation
God has chosen us unto a particular kind of salvation, and this salvation is in the sanctification of the Spirit
Many times while we are going up in the elevators or escalators in the department stores, actually we are going downhill
Sometimes when we want to purchase something, there is One within us telling us not to buy it and even telling us to go home
We need a daily, practical, and present salvation, not by mighty power or miracles, but by the quiet, gentle, mild, sanctifying Spirit
When we are saved by the sanctifying Spirit, we are people under glory, and this glory is for the expression of God
God is manifested in our flesh, but this has to be verified, justified, and vindicated by the all-inclusive Spirit
God's life, God's Spirit, and all the precious truths we have seen in the Lord's recovery have been deposited into our being
If we are a person acting, behaving, and having our life in the Spirit, all that has been deposited into our being will be guarded
Finally, Titus 3:5 tells us that God saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit
The New Testament is not composed of a number of books concerning doctrine, but it is a complete revelation of a wonderful Person
At the apostles' time, however, most of the believers were Jews who came out of Judaism, a strong, high, and profound religion
Even at the time of the Lord Jesus, the Jewish leaders had all these five items as doctrine, yet they did not have the living God
In Hebrews Paul compared this wonderful Person, the Triune God Himself, with all the five crucial items of Judaism
How can angels who are merely servants to God and even servants to God's people compare with such a wonderful Person?
The book of Hebrews opens with the speaking of the Son but continues with the distributions of the Holy Spirit
In the Old Testament God spoke to the fathers in the prophets, but in the New Testament God speaks to us in the Son
The opening words of chapter one introduce us to the Son, but from this time onward Hebrews refers to the Spirit
Hebrews 3:7-8a says, 'Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts'
In the original Greek there is no article before 'Son'; therefore, we can say that in the New Testament God speaks to us in Son
In the Old Testament God spoke through certain men, but in the New Testament God Himself came to speak in the way of incarnation
The introduction of the book of Hebrews is on God's speaking in the Son, but Hebrews 3:7 shows us that the Holy Spirit is speaking
The divine Trinity is the speaking One as the Spirit, who is the consummation of the divine Trinity in the book of Hebrews
The Holy Spirit tells us that when the old tabernacle still remained, the way to enter the Holy of Holies was not yet opened
Christ is realized as the Spirit, so when you have the Spirit, as a partaker of the Spirit, you have the tabernacle and all the offerings
Hebrews does not tell us that we are the partakers of the all-inclusive Christ, but that we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit
As long as we are the partakers of this Spirit, we partake and enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches
Since we are the partakers of the Spirit, we are also partakers of the unique offering, partakers of an eternal redemption
Whatever the Lord accomplished and experienced in His living, labor, and work has been made eternal by the eternal Spirit
He is the Spirit, as the Son, with the Father being the consummation of the processed Triune God in the church
He comprises everything because He is the eternal Spirit through whom the Triune God offered Himself to Himself as the eternal offering
He was among the disciples, but He needed to go through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit
When we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit, this means that we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit as grace
The Son sends the Spirit as the Comforter from with the Father, and the Comforter proceeds from with the Father to us
Corinthians 1:2 refers to 'all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours'
We all know the familiar hymn that says, 'Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine; Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine'!
Also, 1 Corinthians 1:9 tells us that we have been called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord
As Christians we believe in Jesus Christ and we worship God, but we must ask ourselves whether or not we have tasted the Triune God
Even in 1 Corinthians we can see that God gave us Christ as our portion, and we have been called by God into the enjoyment of this Person
Ephesians 4:30 tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God, which means to make Him unhappy by disobeying Him
Love is with the Father as the source, grace is with the Son as the course, and enjoyment is with the Spirit as the very consummation
God as the indwelling Spirit is our Husband and He longs to envy when He sees that we love something, someone, or some matter other than Him
The indwelling Spirit makes His home in us that He may occupy our entire being for God, causing us to be wholly for our Husband
The divine foreknowledge was exercised, and the sanctification of the Spirit follows unto the obedience of faith in Christ
Sanctification brought us to the sprinkling of the blood shed by the Savior on the cross and separates us unto this divine provision
Peter 1:10-11, furthermore, tells us that the Spirit of Christ in the prophets made clear to them concerning Christ's sufferings and glories
The Spirit of God who is the Holy Spirit is also called in the New Testament age the Spirit and the Spirit of Christ
The titles 'the Spirit of God' and 'the Spirit of Christ' denote that the Spirit conveys God and conveys Christ
Also, the Spirit of God denotes that the Spirit is God, and the Spirit of Christ denotes that the Spirit is Christ
On the one hand, the Lord Jesus was the Son of God, and on the other hand, He was God because the Son of God means the Son is God
Within the Spirit of Christ are the elements of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and the resurrection of Christ
Since Jesus was not resurrected yet, how could such a compound, all-inclusive Spirit be in the Old Testament prophets?
In order to answer this question we must see that in Genesis 18 the Lord appeared to Abraham as a man even before He was incarnated
The Spirit of Christ helped the Old Testament prophets inwardly to search out when, where, and how Christ would die and resurrect
Stephen was neither weeping nor pitying himself but his face was like an angel's face because the Spirit of glory was resting upon him
One missionary who belonged to the China Inland Mission and was killed by the Communists in the 1930's wrote a short poem before his death
John 2:20 through 22 tells us that if you deny that Jesus is the Christ you are denying the Son and the Father
Verse 23 tells us that if you deny the Son, you do not have the Father and if you confess the Son, you have the Father
Jesus, Christ, the Son, the Father, and the eternal life when totaled together are the aggregate, all-inclusive Spirit
Since the compound ointment is a type of the Holy Spirit, this indicates that the Holy Spirit is a compound Spirit
If all of our children were 'straight A' students and grew up to be lawyers and doctors, would this help our growth in life?
When you pray in this way you may not understand what you are praying, but as long as you pray the breath gets into you
If his son, however, got sick and was sent to the hospital, he probably would cry out to the Lord, 'O Lord Jesus!
By these three, God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us , that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing in His name
John 5:12 tells us that if we have the Son, we have the eternal life, and if we do not have the Son, we do not have the eternal life
God chose His people in eternity and redeemed His people in time for the purpose of dispensing Himself into them
The first vision concerning Christ shows us Christ as the High Priest walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands
In the four Gospels words of grace are proceeding out of His mouth but in Revelation a sharp twoedged sword is proceeding out of His mouth
In the book of Revelation, however, when John saw such a Christ he fell at His feet as dead; he was full of fear
Probably in our past none of us ever heard a sermon that Christ, our Redeemer, has seven eyes and His eyes are as a flame of fire
Behold He comes with the clouds and every eye shall see Him those also who pierced Him and all the tribes of the lands shall wail over Him
Some may ask, 'How could the Father be the Triune God since the Triune God is the entire God and the Father is only one-third'?
The thought of today's theology is that the entire God is divided into three parts-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The description of the title given to the first of the divine Trinity in Revelation, however, is Him who is, and who was, and who is coming
The three-fold predicate used for the first of the divine Trinity implies and even indicates the divine Trinity
If we are to understand the Bible, we surely have to understand the conclusion of this Bible, the conclusion of the entire divine revelation
Why is the sequence of the divine Trinity in these verses changed and become so complicated as compared to Matthew 28:19?
It is not logical for us to skip over these verses by using the excuse that we are too limited to understand them
The seven Spirits are undoubtedly the Spirit of God, because they are ranked among the Triune God in verses 4 and 5
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on the earth
In substance and existence God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation God's Spirit is sevenfold
At the opening of the other Epistles, only the Father and the Son are mentioned, from whom grace and peace are given to the receivers
In addition this One loves us and has accomplished redemption for us by shedding His blood which washes us and cleanses us from all our sins
The kingdom is for Gods dominion and the priesthood is for Gods expression which fulfills the purpose of Gods creation of man in Genesis 126
Concerning the second of the divine Trinity in Revelation, the seven Spirits, is the modifier, 'before the throne of God'
According to God's economy the Father is the One who is now, who was in the past, and who shall be in the future
Also, in God's existence, the Spirit of God is one, but in God's economy the Spirit of God is seven in function
All these modifiers do not refer to the existence of the Son but to the Son in God's economy, in God's move, in God's actions
Some may argue however that the first designation of the Father refers to existence since it indicates Him who is who was and who shall be
The Father was working in eternity, He was working in creation, He was working in the Son for redemption, and He shall be working
Revelation 1:8 says, 'I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, He who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty'
The Lord Jesus told us that when He was on the earth He was working with the Father and even in the name of the Father
The seven Spirits are not working alone today, but this intensified Spirit is working out from the Father and of the Son
These complications involve the finalization of God's New Testament economy and the conclusion of the divine revelation
At the end of Matthew we see the Trinity described in a simple way as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
We do not need to be baptized into God's economy, His administration, His move, or His acts, but into His essence
In the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible, the Trinity is mentioned not at the end but at the beginning
God's throne is not related to His Person but to His administration, which is altogether a matter of God's economy
In Revelation 1, however, the One who is, and who was, and who is coming refers to the first of the Trinity, the Father
In the previous chapter we saw the Father as Him who is, and who was, and who is coming-Jehovah, God the Triune
In Revelation we see the administration, the government, the activity, the motion, the move, the act, and the work of the Trinity
The One who came to redeem us was God the Son, but the Lord Jesus told us that as He was working the Father was also working
Do not forget that the Son is included in God the Triune so when the Son came to redeem us that was the Fathers coming and the Fathers doing
The Father was doing something in the past, He is doing something now, and He will do something further in the future
Do you believe that only onethird of God became flesh onethird remained on the throne and onethird was as a dove soaring in the heavens
Economically speaking, however, the Spirit descended upon Him as a dove, and the Father spoke well concerning Him
For the first thirty years of His human life the Triune God was His intrinsic essence for His being and existence
In the last three and a half years of His life while He was carrying out His ministry, He needed the economical aspect of the Trinity
He needed the anointing Spirit to be poured out upon Him, and He needed to be filled with the Spirit to carry out His ministry
In Revelation we have seen that the first of the Trinity was moving in the past is moving in the present and is going to move in the future
When Jesus comes again do you believe that the Father will be left in the heavens and the Spirit will be standing by in the air?
Economically the three in the Godhead are consecutive, yet the essential aspect still remains in the economical aspect
These two expressions refer to the revealed Christ and the testifying church and comprise the entire book of Revelation
In the book of Revelation we firstly see Jesus Christ-the revelation of Jesus Christ and then the testimony of Jesus Christ
Also, in Revelation 1 we see the Son of Man in the midst of all the lampstands as the High Priest in His priestly garments
God's New Testament economy is focused on a Person who is all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful
The word witness refers to the person but the word testimony refers to what the person bears, his work, his doing
In no other book of the Bible are these nine items so clearly revealed, and these are the aspects of the church as the testimony of Jesus
As the Priest He is dressing the lamps in the holy place and searching and infusing the churches, the lampstands
Revelation 1:4 and 8 indicate that the Father is the Alpha and the Omega and the One who is, and who was, and who is coming
He is revealed, then we enjoy Him and become His testimony, and eventually our testimony becomes His present revelation
In these two chapters the most striking point is that this all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One speaks
In Revelation 1 are many titles for this wonderful One, but in chapter two are Christ, the all-inclusive Head, and the speaking Spirit
Whatever He is in chapter one has been condensed into the all-inclusive Christ and the speaking Spirit in chapter two
In the epistle to the church in Ephesus we see the all-inclusive Christ as the One who holds the seven stars in His right hand
In speaking to the church in Smyrna He says that He is 'the First and the Last, who became dead, and lived again'
Regardless of how much persecution or what kind of martyrdom the saints suffer, He is the First and He is the Last
Such a declaration implies the creation, the completion, the incarnation, the human living, the crucifixion, and the resurrection
The One who speaks to the church in Thyatira is as the Son of God who has eyes as a flame of fire and feet like shining brass
In this speaking the Lord declared Himself to be the Son of God because this church says He is the son of Mary
Also, to the recovered church, the Lord is the One who has the key of David, the key of the kingdom, with authority to open and to shut
He is the Beginning of the entire universe, the Witness to keep the things going, and the Amen, the very ending
To the church in Ephesus this all-inclusive, wonderful One promises to give the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life
The open manna was revealed in Exodus 16, but the hidden manna is something particular and specific for your enjoyment
They will be given the authority over the nations to shepherd them with an iron rod and they will also enjoy Him as the morning star
Also, their names will not be erased out of the book of life but will be confessed by Him at His second coming
In the same way, the overcomers of the church in Philadelphia all have been built into the temple and are the pillars in the temple
These overcomers bear three names: the name of God, the name of the holy city, New Jerusalem, and the new name of this wonderful One
The main point is that the overcomers experience the enjoyment of life and the building into God's temple as their reward
We care to feast with Him we care for the crown of life we care to be a piece of white stone and to be built into a pillar in Gods temple
Lord, do cover us with Your prevailing blood against all the attacks, the frustrations, and the disturbances from the evil one
May we all be filled with Yourself, filled with Your glory, filled with Your anointing, and filled with Your rich grace to meet every need
Of course, the One sitting on the throne is God, 'and He Who was sitting was like in appearance to a jasper stone and a sardius'
The seven Spirits of God burning before God's throne as a flame of fire are judging the entire world, both the believers and the unbelievers
According to 1 Peter 4:17 this judgment begins from the house of God and will spread to the unbelievers, the entire earth
There is an intent, a purpose, for the burning of the seven Spirits, that is, to bring forth the golden lampstands, the churches
If we are shortsighted and do not have the foresight, we will be very much disappointed by today's world situation
Many Christians and all the people of the world do not know what is going on behind the scenes in today's world situation
Far, we have seen three items: the throne, the One sitting on the throne, and the seven Spirits of God burning as a flame before the throne
Also, if you cut off any of the words of this book, you will be cut off from the tree of life and from the New Jerusalem
We have seen the Father sitting on the throne, God the Spirit burning before the throne, and God the Son as the slain Lamb standing there
Essentially speaking, the Father is the Father, the Son is the Son, and the Spirit is the Spirit for existence
The traditional teaching of the divine Trinity stresses that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate Persons
In order to carry out His administration God needs an executor and this Executor is this wonderful Person, the slain Lamb
The all-inclusive, excellent, marvelous, mysterious, and wonderful One is the Executor of God's administration
John saw the view that in the entire universe no one was qualified or worthy to carry out God's administration except this One
Christ is the very focal Executor of God's economy, yet He needs the seven Spirits as His eyes to carry out God's economy
All the international affairs are neither in the hands of the diplomats nor in the hands of the United Nations
Neither Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, nor any of the world governments were the deciding factors of the world situation
When Hitler took over Belgium in World War II, it would have been possible for him to go straight into England
England was unprepared to face that situation and was ready to be taken over by Hitler but Hitler made the decision to turn to attack Russia
The purpose of the burning flame in carrying out God's economy is to bring forth the golden lampstands, the churches
We are here endeavoring to afford the Lord a chance and an entrance to judge us, purify us, and refine us to produce a pure golden lampstand
The twofold mission of the seven Spirits is to carry out God's administration and to search and infuse the churches
Christ offers the prayer to God, He adds Himself as the incense, then He receives the answer and pours the answer out upon the earth
As the strong Angel coming down out of heaven, Christ, the universal Person, places His right foot on the sea and His left foot on the land
To place His feet on the sea and upon the land is to tread upon them, and to tread upon them is to take possession of them
Eventually, all the peoples of the earth who are fighting in order to claim more territory will discover that they have done this in vain
Finally, Revelation 18:1 shows us that as another Angel of God He appears in glory to make the whole earth the kingdom of God
The church eventually will be the Bride for the Lamb to marry and the worldly people will consummate in Antichrist with his army against God
The Christ in John 1:1 and 14 is the Word for incarnation and redeeming, but in Revelation 19 Christ as the Word is for judging
We have stressed very much that the seven Spirits today are judging, purifying, refining, and bringing forth the churches
If we do not allow the seven Spirits to refine us, the seven Spirits have no way to shine and there is no testimony
The more we let the Spirit purify us and refine us, the more He shines through us and this shining is the testimony of the churches
The refining fire produces the lampstands, the churches, in this age with the saturating water, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem
Both the lampstand and the New Jerusalem are the full expression of God and the testimony of Jesus, in this age and in eternity
Some things revealed in this book are altogether new and other things were already revealed in the Old Testament
In this book is the reaping, the harvest, of all the divine truths which were sown as seeds in the book of Genesis
The first issue of God's New Testament economy is the golden lampstands which are signs or symbols of the churches
In Exodus 25 Christ was the unique lampstand, but in Revelation this lampstand has been reproduced, duplicated, and thus multiplied
There were more than seven local churches on the earth at the time of Revelation so the number seven is a representative number
When John spoke concerning the church he brought in something new which Paul never touched, and this new item is the lampstand
The most mysterious aspect of the church which Paul gives us is the Body as the fullness of the One that fills all in all
The fullness is firstly of the unlimited Christ, the very Christ that fills all in all, and then the fullness of the infinite God
Fullness, however, in the book of Ephesians is not the riches, but the issue of our enjoyment of the riches of Christ
In the dark night there is the need of the light, and the churches are the lampstands holding the lamps to shine and enlighten
We think that our perspective is very smart, sharp, and to the point, but God's perspective is absolutely different from ours
Balaam also went on to say concerning Israel, 'Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee'
When Moses was called by God, he told the Lord that the Egyptians would not believe that the Lord had appeared unto him
If any brothers were to stay with one another for approximately one week, they would discover that none of them are 'golden brothers'
On the other hand, we all need to realize that because we have received the Lord, we have something golden in us
Many of us have been in the church life for years and we do not have much realization that we have grown that much
Of course, we all should hate gossip in the church life, but sometimes matters such as this may be of the Lord's sovereignty
When the Lord died on the cross many grains were produced in His resurrection, and the many grains are the multiplication of that one grain
As those who have been begotten of God we have to believe and realize that the divine substance has been born into our being
The Lord also went on to say that since God is Spirit, those that worship Him must worship Him in their spirit
The living water is here for us to drink, and our drinking of the living water is a real worship to God who is the living water
The more you pray, the more you eat and the more you drink, and the more you drink and eat, the more of God you will substantially receive
Christ is the mold, the form, and the likeness, and the New Testament tells us that as His many brethren we will be conformed to His image
People can see that in our daily life we do not live the natural life because the natural life is under the cross
All the saints in the churches are being shaped into the image of Christ, so all the churches are being molded into a form
The golden lampstands are also filled with God the Spirit as the seven shining Spirits-the full expression of the Triune God
In the New Testament we are told to be filled with the Spirit , to walk according to Spirit , and to bear the fruit of the Spirit
In our church service we can only have the manifestation of the Spirit as our expression by praying in our spirit
Ephesians 5:18 charges us not to be filled with wine in our body, but to be filled with the divine element and riches in our spirit
The fruit of the Spirit and the manifestation of the Spirit are both the expression, the shining, of the lampstands
Eventually, in the coming eternity the issue will be the New Jerusalem and that issue will be much richer than the golden lampstand
In Paul's fourteen Epistles he mainly taught the mystery of God which is Christ and the mystery of Christ which is the church
The Bible does not tell us that the Father has an image or a form, nor does it say that the Spirit has a likeness
The words image, form, likeness, and mold are ascribed to the second of the Trinity, so He is the shape of the lampstand
In our life we have the fruit as the expression, and in our ministry we have the manifestation as the expression
According to the entire revelation of the Bible God the Father is the element God the Son is the shape and God the Spirit is the expression
When these three aspects are put together, we see the lampstand which is the embodiment of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit
In element or in nature, in shape or in type, in expression or in manifestation, a local church is exactly the same as Jesus Christ
By the time we reach the book of Revelation, everything has been covered already in the Old and New Testaments
In the lampstand there is the crucial and vital concept that the Triune God is being wrought into His redeemed
The lampstand signifies that the Triune God has been wrought into His redeemed, but now we need to ask how this takes place
We have already seen that in order for the Triune God to be wrought into us we all need to eat , drink , and breathe of the Lord
We have received a supreme birth, the birth of God, and by this birth something divine has been born in us, into our being
Many of the teachings in today's Christianity turn people away from the divine gene to endeavoring and striving for self improvement
We need the scientific teaching of the divine life to find out how to water this life and nourish this life to cause this life to grow
We do not need the teaching which teaches people to improve their behavior and to try, endeavor, strive, and struggle to do good
Even if someone has been recently saved we need to tell him that God has been born into him and that he has God in him
In these verses, Paul talks about Christ being in us and indwelling us in a very scientific, thorough, and detailed way
We all need this kind of scientific study and teaching concerning the very God who has been born into our being
The lampstand as the embodiment of the Triune God is altogether a doctrine if we do not have the adequate experiential knowledge
The renewing of the Spirit is the Spirit applying all the divine things, of which we have been born, into our being in our practical life
You have been born of a certain set of parents and you have your disposition, your view, your thinking, and your likes and dislikes
The Spirit is here to apply all the divine things into your being in your daily life-this is the renewing of the Spirit
Now the Spirit is replacing our old being every day with His new being, and this is the renewing of the Spirit
After God begot us, He came into us to dwell in us as the life-giving Spirit to replace our old being with Himself as the new being
In Titus 3:5 Paul tells us that God saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit
The Greek word for transformed is used in Romans 12:2 where we are told that we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind
He is wrought into us not merely by birth, but also by the renewing of the Spirit and by the transformation with the divine life
He now indwells us as the Spirit to apply all that He has put into us to replace our old being with Himself as the new being
A piece of petrified wood is a compound of the deposit of the mineral elements which all have been wrought into the wood
Through the years and day by day the heavenly minerals have been deposited into our being to make us pieces of precious stone
We also have the divine life which is the life of God's firstborn Son, and this life has its essence, power, and shape
We are not imitating Christ, but we are growing by Christ as our life and eventually we grow unto the conformity of Christ
We do not need to grope like blind men to know the source of the universe, and we do not need Darwin to tell us anything
According to the black and white letters, we all can see that the last item of the sixty-six books of the Bible is the New Jerusalem
The reason for this is because this result, this ultimate consummation, was taken away by the traditional teachings of Christianity
There are hardly any Bible readers who understand the last two chapters of the Bible in a proper and adequate way
Many Christians do not spend much time on these two chapters because they think that these two chapters are a record of the heavenly mansion
We know the Bible contains the divine revelation; the conclusion of such a revelation, therefore, should be very high and very significant
We need to see and realize what the ultimate consummation of His purpose is, not only in the universe but especially in man
All the positive things in the Bible consummate in the New Jerusalem, which is covered in the last two chapters of the entire Bible
The conclusion of the sixty-six books of the Bible is contained in its last two chapters which are on the New Jerusalem
Some of us need to study the New Jerusalem to find out all the items of the divine revelation that can be seen there
The mingling of God with man can be seen in typology in Leviticus 2:4 with the meal offering, composed of fine flour mingled with oil
The New Jerusalem is also the ultimate consummation of the positive types, figures, and signs of the Scriptures
The children of Israel as God's people were also a lampstand, and the churches as God's chosen people are the lampstands
We have seen that the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of all the divine, spiritual things in the Bible
We need to have a thorough study of the New Jerusalem since it has never been thoroughly studied and properly interpreted
One point concerning the New Jerusalem which we will be unable to touch or to cover is the twelve foundation stones
In order for us to understand the real significance of the New Jerusalem we have to get into the real significance of its designations
The old man has nothing of God in it, but the new man is not only born of God but also created and constituted with God
Everything that is designated new in the New Testament indicates or implies that God has been wrought into these items
The new wineskins, the new wine, the new garment, and the New Testament all are designated new because God is in them
A piece of furniture is old because it does not have God, but as a believer you are new because you have God wrought into you
Also, Revelation 21 and 22 provide us with many indications that the New Jerusalem possesses the divine nature and the divine life
All the redeemed ones composed together are a new creation in Christ, and this new creation has the divine element
Corinthians 5:17 says, 'If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new'
To say that all things have become new means that all things have become God since God is new and since God is newness
According to Colossians 3:11, the new man is constituted with Christ because in the new man there cannot be any natural man
Not only is there no natural person in the new man, but there is no possibility, no room, for any natural person
In the new man there cannot be Greek and Jew circumcision and uncircumcision barbarian Scythian slave freeman but Christ is all and in all
Christ was born into you at your new birth and from that time Christ is being constituted into your very being to transform you into Christ
Because a certain piece of furniture is made with wood and constituted with wood, we can say that it is wood or wooden
If we do not have the constitution of Christ for us to remember that we need to live Christ, it is impossible to live Him
According to our fellowship thus far, we can see that to say the New Jerusalem is a physical city prepared by God is absolutely absurd
There is no saturation of God in the Old Testament, and the holiness or sanctification there is only positional, not dispositional
In the Old Testament a piece of gold could be made holy and sanctified by changing its position, by putting it in the temple
In the New Testament, however, the church is God's temple and this temple is not only separated unto God but also saturated with God
In Hebrews 12:22, however, the writer tells us that we have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem
If Mount Zion and the city of the living God were something physical, how could we have come to them even today?
We have received a heavenly call , have tasted the heavenly gift , and can live a heavenly life on earth today
Hebrews 12:22 clearly indicates that the heavenly Jerusalem is not a physical city because we have already come to this heavenly Jerusalem
Many Christians are waiting to go to the New Jerusalem, but we must realize that we have come to the New Jerusalem already
To say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city depreciates God's wisdom and belittles this eternal, wise Architect
God is a wise designer and artificer who designed such a city to be a full manifestation of His multifarious wisdom
Corinthians 3:12 tells us that in this age, the church age, we should build the church with gold, silver, and precious stones
In the coming age, silver becomes pearl, and the materials in the New Jerusalem are gold, pearl, and precious stones
Gold signifies God's nature, silver signifies Christ's redemption, and the precious stones signify the transforming work of the Holy Spirit
These signs signify the divine work of the divine Trinity who is being wrought into our being through His divine work
We are now building the church with God the Father's nature, with God the Son's redemption, and with God the Spirit's transforming work
All the apostles were created pieces of clay , but they were regenerated and transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building
Hebrews 11:10 tells us that the city has foundations and in Revelation 21:19-20 we see the twelve foundations of the city
The tabernacle in the Old Testament was a material building, but the tabernacle in the New Testament is a Person
The temple in the Old Testament was a material building, but in John 2 the Lord Jesus indicates that He Himself is the temple
After His resurrection, this Person was enlarged, multiplied, and propagated, so this Person became a corporate Person
The standing boards in the tabernacle are made of acacia wood, which is hard, strong, and fine wood, overlaid with gold
The entire city is a mingling of God with His redeemed people and this mingling is a mutual dwelling for God and His redeemed
In the same way all the designations of the New Jerusalem imply its constituents, elements, composition, and constitution
As we have pointed out, the word new, especially in the New Testament, denotes that the divine element has been wrought into God's creation
The church as the new man and the new creation means that the divine element has been wrought into the man created by God
We have seen that the designation 'the holy city' denotes that God's holy nature has been wrought into the New Jerusalem
Because this is a building of the divine nature and the human nature, it is a building for both God and man, a mutual building
Based upon these first three titles or designations, it is impossible to say that the New Jerusalem is a physical, material city
How could a physical city be built with the divine nature and the human nature and become a mutual abode for God and man?
Also, 'the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb'
There is one church with many members and Paul betrothed the believers in a corporate way as one corporate virgin to one husband-Christ
According to Revelation 121 this woman is clothed with the sun and the moon underneath her feet and on her head a crown of twelve stars
We also see that the rest of the woman's seed are those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus
Those who keep the commandments of God are the Jews, and those who have the testimony of Jesus are the New Testament believers
After the man-child is brought to the throne of God there is a period of 1,260 days, which is the period of the great tribulation
When a certain man's wife was only ten years old, she was his wife, but she was not consummated to be his wife
When she finally reached the age of twenty-three to become this man's bride, that was the consummation of this ten-year-old girl
The church in Ephesians 5 is like that little girl who is ten years old, and the New Jerusalem will be the consummated bride
The church in Ephesians 5 still has wrinkles and spots, but the bride in Revelation 21 has no wrinkles or spots
The increase in John 3:30, however, is the bride in verse 29, which is a living composition of all the regenerated people
Since John the Baptist had carried out his ministry to introduce Jesus Christ, it was necessary that he must decrease
To the Lord a thousand years are as one day , so the millennium will be the wedding day of the Lamb with the church as His bride
The New Jerusalem, the heavenly Jerusalem, the Jerusalem above, is our mother and this mother is the new covenant of grace
Finally, the center, substance, element, and essence of the ultimate consummation of the Scriptures, the New Jerusalem, is the Triune God
The Triune God firstly created everything including man, and He permitted Satan to be there as the troublemaker in the universe
Based upon our fellowship thus far, we can understand that to come to the new covenant is just to come to the New Jerusalem
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God passing through the long process of His new covenant
We all have to be wrought with God and by God that we might be fully transformed, saturated, and conformed to Himself
When an oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl
Due to intense heat and pressure these stones were transformed from their original form and nature to a transformed form and nature
If we would pay our attention to this matter of gold when we study the Bible, we would realize that gold is a special item in the Bible
When the resin of the tree, the tree's life secretion, the tree's sap, congeals into gum, this gum is considered as a kind of pearl
In the New Jerusalem the gold is for the base, pearls are for the gates, and the precious stones are for the wall
The record of these three materials in Genesis 2:12 is in this sequence because this is the sequence of building
For the proper building up of the church Paul mentions three kinds of materials-gold, silver, and precious stones
Paul says that he laid the unique foundation and that we should build on this foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones
Gold, silver, and precious stones signify the various experiences of Christ in the virtues and attributes of the Triune God
When we reach the book of Revelation we see that on the twelve foundation stones of the holy city there are twelve names
All the Apostles were created pieces of clay, but they were regenerated and transformed into precious stones for God's eternal building
In the Gospel of John, Peter was named 'a stone' by the Lord and in John's Revelation this same Peter is one of the twelve foundation stones
The Lord's word in John 1 concerning Peter being a stone was a prophecy which was fully fulfilled in Revelation 21
He first boasted that he would never deny the Lord and eventually in the same night he denied the Lord three times
He was predicted to be a stone in John 1, he became a stone in 1 Peter 2, and he is a foundation stone in the New Jerusalem
Bdellium is out of the plant life in Genesis 2 and pearl is out of the oyster, the animal life in Revelation 21
After Genesis 3 when sin came in, God still wanted to produce the pearls but now there is the need of redemption
The tree of life grows in the river of water of life, which flows out of the throne, not only of God but also of the Lamb
The Lamb is not implied until Genesis 3 when Jehovah God made coats of skins to clothe Adam and Eve after man's fall
We not only inherit the divine nature in the future but we are partakers of the divine nature partaking of enjoying the divine nature today
Many of the saints have really partaken of the divine nature and have a substantial amount of the divine nature within them
We must realize that we are not simply allegorizing the Bible, but pointing out the real things in the Biblical allegories
Even in human language there is the need of allegory because some things cannot be expressed or described by mere plain and direct words
We all have to fight the battle, showing people that the Bible unveils to us that we believers have God within us as the divine nature
It is not your knowledge, your education, your good character, your kindness, your humility, or even your love
In all the messages we have given, we have never touched in a thorough and adequate way the definition of the divine nature
We have received the divine nature, but there is a question as to whether or not we are partaking of the divine nature
Not many of us have ever paid an adequate amount of attention to the matter of how to become an enjoyer of the divine nature
When many Christians study the Bible, their first concern is for their welfare or for what blessing or profit they can get from the Bible
Their second concern is how to worship God, how to fear Him, how to please Him, and how to do things to glorify Him
There are three verses in the Bible which puzzle many Bible students and translators-Romans 1:20, Colossians 2:9, and 2 Peter 1:4
Colossians 2:9 says that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead, not the fullness of divinity but the Godhead, the Person
Our thought might have been to forget about the fragments of bread and the pieces of fish which were left over
When the crowds were fully satisfied, the Lord said to His disciples, 'Gather the broken pieces left over that nothing may be lost'
The Scriptures record that the disciples took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and of the fish
Light, orderliness, and love are some of the characteristics of God, and actually they are characteristics of God's divine nature
The only difference between the Greek word for divinity in Romans 1:20 and the Greek word for Godhead in Colossians 2:9 is the letter i
As believers we should have the divine characteristics of the divine nature and even the divine nature itself but we cannot have the Godhead
In Colossians 2:9 the Godhead implies the divine nature because the divine nature is one of the constituents of God
When we read the ten commandments, we can see that God is love, that God is light, that God is holy, and that God is righteous
These are the virtues of the human morality created by God, but in God's created man there was no divine nature
The Apostle John also tells us in his first Epistle that when we were begotten of God, a divine seed entered into our being
We have received the divine life through the divine birth and this divine life has a nature which is the divine nature of God
The problem is this-we all have received the divine nature, but we do not regularly enjoy what we have received
We need to forget about these things and to pick up one thing-how to enjoy the divine nature and how to partake of the divine nature
The divine nature is the nature of God's Person, the nature of God's essence, and the nature of God's expression
Also, light is the nature of God's expression, so Spirit, love, and light are the constituents of the divine nature
In such a fellowship you realize and enjoy the Lord as the Spirit, and simultaneously you enjoy the nature of God's essence, which is love
You may have been disgusted with your wife before this fellowship, but afterwards you are filled with love for your wife
In John's Epistle we come to the Father to participate in His love and light in the fellowship of the Father's life
We all need to remember that the New Jerusalem has a base and this base is pure gold, which in typology refers to God's divine nature
Spirit is the nature of God's Person, love is the nature of God's essence, and light is the nature of God's expression
When we touch God, we touch Him as Spirit in His Person, as love in His essence, and as light in His expression
My hope is that one day even our children would know what the divine nature is and that this would be common knowledge
The New Jerusalem is God's building and gold, which is the very symbol of His divine nature, is the base of His building
When we remain in the divine fellowship with God, we enjoy God directly as light and love, which is the enjoyment of the divine nature
In John's first Epistle we see that the divine love is the source of grace and the divine light is the source of truth
When this divine love appears to us, it becomes grace, and when this divine light shines upon us, it becomes truth
To partake of the divine nature is to touch the source of grace and truth since the divine nature is the source of grace and of truth
As believers we do have a heavenly current of the heavenly electricity and we need to remain in this current, to remain in the fellowship
At this juncture everything in your home, in your yard, on the street, in the heavens, and on the earth is so pleasant and lovely
To say that we merely partake of God is too general, but to say that we partake of the divine nature is particular
Even though he was unlearned, Peter could write such a marvelous Epistle which included many wonderful divine points
He said that we all have been allotted like precious faith and that the divine power has granted us all things related to life and godliness
When he was writing, undoubtedly, the Spirit was within him giving him the utterance and the proper expressions
According to his experience, Peter told us that God's divine power has imparted to the believers all things related to life
The first part of 2 Peter 1:4 says, 'Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises'
Faith is the substantiation of the substance of the truth , which is the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy
Such a faith is allotted to all the believers in Christ as their portion, which is equally precious to all who have received it
It brings all the contents of its substantiation into us, thus making them all with itself subjective to us in our experience
When the light brings the scenery to the film within the camera, both the seeing and the scenery become subjective to it
Virtue denotes the energy of the divine life issuing in vigorous action to overcome all obstacles and to carry out all excellent attributes
When you contact the Lord, you have the sensation that something within you is energizing, stirring up, and rising up
You begin to realize that you are too wild, too free, especially in the passions, desires, lusts, and in the self
Without contacting the Lord, you would be so wild and so free in doing things and you would not endure anything or anybody
As the divine nature develops within you, you will spontaneously be a person that is like God and expresses God
At this point, we not only love those who behave themselves in the brothers house but also love those who do not behave
When we remain in the fellowship we touch the source and we enjoy the divine love as the essence and the divine light as the expression
In this enjoyment we let the divine seed of the allotted faith develop to its consummation-the divine nobler love
In the last two chapters, we have seen what the divine nature is and we have also seen how to partake of this divine nature
The way to enjoy the divine nature is to remain in the divine fellowship and to cooperate with the development of the divine nature
In Romans 8:2 Paul refers emphatically to 'the law of the Spirit of life' which has set us free from the law of sin and of death
Paul stressed this inner law because he was an apostle through whom God's dispensation, God's economy, was unveiled to the uttermost
The New Testament is altogether dependent on the law of life, while the entire Old Testament economy depended upon the law of letters
Genesis 126 tells us that God made man in His image and Gods image is the expression of four items love light holiness and righteousness
The ten commandments were established and given based upon these four divine attributes, which are a description of what God is
The law, the photograph, was given in the Old Testament, but the real Person, as embodied in Jesus came in the New Testament
The law of life in the New Testament is a living Person, of whom a photograph was given in the Old Testament, which was the law of letters
If you are a fisherman like John and Peter, you can be used by the Lord only according to that particular measure
John's writings, for example, are quite simple-'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
Only in these two apostles' writings can we see clearly and emphatically the enjoyment and partaking of the divine nature
Spirit is the nature of God's Person, love is the nature of God's essence, and light is the nature of God's expression
Our experiences tell us that the genuine holiness, the consummation of the Christian holiness, is the issue of the enjoyment of God as love
Love is the ultimate development in the divine nature and the consummation of the development of the divine nature
As we cooperate with this divine nature, it will have the opportunity to develop itself to its consummation which is love
All these things being thus dissolved, what kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness'
In the development of the divine nature, love is developed in brotherly love and brotherly love is developed in godliness
At the beginning of 2 Peter godliness consummates in love, and at the end of 2 Peter we see that the holy manner of life goes with godliness
Now for you to enjoy God is to enjoy the divine nature, which is constituted mainly with love as the essence and light as the expression
In our community, our neighborhood, and among our relatives, colleagues, and classmates, we must give people an impression of distinction
The divine love, the noble love, agape, made Jesus Christ distinct among all the people, which means He was holy
In his two Epistles we see that love is the consummation of the enjoyment of the divine nature and that this love has an expression-holiness
John tells us in his first Epistle that he preached the eternal life to others that they might be brought into the divine fellowship
Through this life, you have received the divine fellowship and if you remain in the divine fellowship, you will enjoy God as light
You know where you are, what you are doing, where you should go, what you should do, and what you should speak
John indicates that if we remain in the fellowship and enjoy God as light there is no way that we can say that we are not sinful anymore
He says that 'If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
John 2:29 says, 'If you have known that He is righteous, you know also that everyone who practices righteousness has been begotten of Him'
If you are in the light and are enjoying God as light, you will have an expression that you are right in everything and with everyone
When you do things wrongly and when you do wrong things to others, this is a strong indication that you are not in the light
Whenever a husband loses his temper with his wife, he knows nothing, he is the most foolish person, and he speaks nonsense
It is possible for one to pretend to be something in others' eyes, but you cannot pretend to be anything in the eyes of your spouse
When you stay in the divine fellowship, however, the other party of your marriage knows and can testify that you are different
In conclusion, holiness is the issue of the enjoyment of the divine love and righteousness is the issue of the enjoyment of the divine light
The Bible is not a book of religion, philosophy, or something invented by the human mentality, but it is God's revelation of the divine life
Without Paul's writing in Galatians 4 none of us would dream that these two women were an allegory of the two covenants
Love, light, and life are a few of the many attributes of God's divine Person, but the most basic attribute of God is the Trinity
The reason why the number three is so prevalent in the New Jerusalem is that this number represents the divine Trinity
When the oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, a little rock, it secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl
In one of Charles Wesley's hymns he refers to the five bleeding wounds which the Lord bore when He was being crucified on the cross
You may have been a Christian for many years, and yet you have never been told that you need to remain in the death of Christ
Not many of us realize that the Lord's all-inclusive death should be our residence, our home, in which we must stay
It grasps the rock in the very wound it made, so the wound becomes its residence, its home, its dwelling place
If the rock stays away from the wound of the oyster, it is not in the position to enjoy the secretion of the life-sap of that oyster
The wound signifies the death of Christ in which we sinners who wounded Christ are captured, kept, and imprisoned
As One who is living and organic, He was wounded by us and He reacted by resurrecting to secrete His life-sap around the wounding ones
The pearls are the gates, and this point of the allegory means that the more we are made pearls, the more we are in the New Jerusalem
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were regenerated, and this was the initiation of our entering into the New Jerusalem
As we stay in the Lord's death and enjoy His life-secreting resurrection, there is a further entering into the New Jerusalem
The death of Christ is the right place for you to receive and experience the secretion of life by the resurrected Christ
The divine element is being added to our human element making us pearls for the building of God's eternal expression
His death is imprisoning us to keep us in the position of enjoying the secretion of Christ around our entire being
The secretion is the operation of His life-giving Spirit; if you do not have His Spirit, you do not have His resurrection
To use the allegory of a pearl, however, to illustrate the entering into the kingdom of God by regeneration is much more significant
We all have seen that the basic elements of the structure of the New Jerusalem are gold, pearls, and precious stones
Precious stones signify the produce of the Spirit in His transforming work with His divine element for the building up of God's building
Pearls, however, do not refer to Christ Himself directly, but to the produce of His work of redemption through His death and resurrection
In Acts 5 we see a great teacher of the law named Gamaliel , under whom the Apostle Paul received his education
God's economy in the New Testament began on the day of Pentecost under the leadership of a Galilean fisherman named Peter
Gamaliel was a godly man who feared God, yet he did not know anything concerning God's economy and had no share in God's economy
Gamaliel and the other Pharisees were content with the knowledge of God that they had received according to their traditional teaching
We may be godly and even respected and revered by other people, and yet have no share in or knowledge of God's New Testament economy
Today's seminaries teach the traditional theology and yet they know nearly nothing concerning God's New Testament economy
When we were regenerated, we received the nature of God and a part of this golden mountain entered into our being
As we have seen, 2 Peter 1 tells us that we are partakers of the divine nature and shows us the development of the divine nature
The divine nature within us as symbolized by the gold does not work but it grows or develops and its development needs a good environment
In order for the divine nature to develop within us to its fullest extent, we need to give it the best environment
Now we need to let this divine nature have the best cooperation and the best environment that it may grow and develop within us
Whenever you remain in the all-inclusive death of Christ, whenever you take the cross, the resurrection life of Christ secretes over you
He may feel that he needs to complain or rebel, but if he does this, he is running away from the death of Christ
The more trouble her husband would give her, the more enjoyment she would have as long as she remains in the death of Christ
Thank the Lord that today He has opened the veils and has shown us the way to be victorious and to be an overcomer
Christ secretes His resurrection life over you and following this the Spirit works to transform you with the life element
Verse 18 tells us that we 'are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit'
The Spirit's transforming work is with His bountiful supply of the divine element for the building up of God's building
Consummately, the transforming work of the Spirit issues in the New Jerusalem, which bears the image of God for His expression
God appears like a jasper stone in Revelation 4:3, and the New Jerusalem, having the glory of God, shines like a jasper stone
Also, the first layer of the wall's foundation, as well as the entire wall of the New Jerusalem is built with jasper
Since jasper signifies God expressed in His communicable glory , the main function of the holy city is to express God in bearing His glory
The secreting work is the initiation and the entrance into the holy city, but the transforming work is for the building of the wall
Life secreting makes us into pearls, but for us to be precious stone there is the need of a further step-the transforming work of the Spirit
Give us liberty, freedom, and the full release that we may have the insight to look into Your Word and to get into its depths
At the conclusion of the Bible, we see that the Triune God Himself is the very entrance for man to enter into Him
If the Son had never come to die on the cross, there would be no basis for us to enter into the kingdom of God
The Son came to be our channel and through this channel we get into the Spirit, and the Spirit brings us unto the Father
Through the Son as a channel and by the Spirit as a sphere we have been brought not only unto the Father but also into the Father
In 1 Peter 1:1-2 we see the Father's choosing, the Spirit's sanctifying, and the sprinkling of the Son's blood
Timewise, in the new heaven and new earth, there are twelve months yearly, twelve hours daily, and twelve hours nightly
Both the twelve tribes in the Old Testament and the twelve apostles in the New Testament are for God's governmental administration
The number twelve indicates God's governmental administration and the entire New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God's administration
twelve gates' indicate that the communication in the New Jerusalem is absolutely perfect and eternally complete for God's administration
The twelve gates are twelve pearls , signifying that the entrance is the produce of Christ in His redemptive and secreting work
Praise the Lord for the triune gates and the triune entrance, which are the communication of God's administrative business
Because the twelve tribes in the Old Testament were for Gods administration this indicates that the twelve gates are for Gods administration
The names of the twelve tribes inscribed on the twelve gates indicate that the law is watching over the twelve gates
As you are 'walking through the gate' and you call on the name of the Lord Jesus, the law says that you are okay
When we entered into the gate, the law was satisfied since the requirement of the law had been fully fulfilled
When we came to the triune entrance we had a 'free ticket' because Christ paid the price for us, and the guard at the gate honors Christ
In addition, we must realize that the law is not only a watcher at the gate but also the child-conductor of the entry
We see twelve angels at the twelve gates , signifying that the angels watch over the entry into the New Jerusalem
In Luke 15:10 the Lord Jesus says, 'There is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting'
The Triune God, the twelve tribes, the law, and all the angels were working together for our entering into the New Jerusalem
Revelation 21:18a tells us that the wall was built with jasper, signifying the appearance of God for His expression
The center of the city is God on the throne who appears as jasper and the circumference of the city is its wall which is built with jasper
Revelation 21:12 tells us that the wall is great and high for separation unto God and for protection of God's interest
Since one stadion is approximately 600 feet, the wall is approximately one thousand three hundred and sixty-four miles long
The Great Wall of China is built with old bricks but our great wall is built with jasper, and this jasper is clear as crystal
The wall implies transformation, building, the image of God, the expression of God, the testimony of Jesus, separation, and protection
Peter was merely a stone, but in the New Jerusalem he is a jasper stone, the first layer of the wall's foundation
The wall is not built with natural materials merely created by God, but the wall is built with transformed items
We all were natural beings, but we have been transformed from the old creation into the new creation in Christ
In the New Jerusalem there will be no Chinese American Spanish Mexican Japanese Korean French Italian German or any other culture or race
All the different colors and all the different cultures will be swallowed up by the rich divine life of the Triune God
We all need to realize that we are under the transformation, but do not forget that following transformation is cutting
Thank the Lord that He is transforming us and cutting us that we may fit in the building of the wall of His eternal habitation
The jasper wall signifies that the whole city, as the corporate expression of God in eternity, bears the appearance of God
The great wall is the unique expression of the jasper God, and the jasper God is expressed in the jasper city through the jasper wall
When we look at this city which is in the appearance of God for His expression, we can see that today's Christianity does not match this
On the one hand, the book of Revelation gives us the revelation of Christ , and on the other hand it shows us the testimony of Jesus
Today every local church must be such a testimony, but it depends upon the degree of transformation and building
The transformation and the building are the basic factors to have the testimony of Jesus expressing the Triune God
The designation 'the holy city' means the separated city, a city that is separated from anything other than God
No other city is as holy or as sanctified as this one because this city is the embodiment, the increase, and the expansion of God
a measure of a man, that is, of an angel' signifies that the wall of the city is not natural but in resurrection
Many of the sisters would like to be angels, but we must remember that if we want to be like an angel, we have to be in resurrection
Within this protected city is God's throne to carry out His administration, which is absolutely perfect and eternally complete
Twelve foundations signify the foundation of absolute perfection and eternal completion in God's administration
As brothers in the Lord we should buy our ties according to God's nature and wear our shoes according to His nature
Some Christians who are concerned about being holy have regulations, but in the New Jerusalem there is only one regulation-the golden street
God's divine nature is the unique regulation, and this is the way we have to take and the street we have to walk on
If we take God's nature as our unique way we will be pure, without mixture, and transparent, without opaqueness
If this husband would live with his wife and love her according to God's nature, the river of life would flow within him
Whatever we do according to God's nature, we immediately have the deep sensation of the flow of life watering us
Since twelve signifies absolute perfection and eternal completion in God's administration, twelve thousand signifies a thousand times this
The entire New Jerusalem is straight, perfect, and complete, without any defect, bias, obliqueness, or shortage
The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and the temple, are equal in length, breadth, and height
That the length the breadth and the height of the New Jerusalem are equal signifies that the entire New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies
The holy city is not measured according to man's concept, idea, philosophy, or qualification, but according to God's divine nature
The city lying foursquare signifies that the New Jerusalem is perfect and complete in every way absolutely straight without any obliqueness
The governments of this earth are full of politicians, but in the church we have to learn one thing-do not play politics
The city's being equal in three dimensions as a cube means that the city is perfect to the uttermost with no defects, bias, or obliqueness
The city is not a physical thing, but a personal entity, and we must understand the New Jerusalem in a personal way
We may understand the word 'tabernacle' as a physical thing, but Revelation 21:2 tells us that this city is a bride
On the one hand, the New Jerusalem is a tabernacle for God's dwelling, and on the other hand, the city is a temple for us to dwell in
All that He has obtained and attained are the materials for the building up of this wonderful temple that we have today
The designation 'the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb' signifies the many attributes and accomplishments of the Triune God
We are in such a temple built with the Lord, with God, with the Almighty, with the Lamb, and with all His attributes and accomplishments
When God went to the cross to die for our sins and to accomplish redemption, He was the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world
When we get into eternity we shall dwell and serve, worship and pray in the processed Triune God as the Spirit reaching us
You may feel that He is sitting on the throne as the Almighty One, and you are so pitiful on the earth, praying in a 'poor cottage'
Your feeling may be that you are begging a very hard God who is sitting on the throne and does not care for you
Today we do not have any physical temple, but our temple is our Triune, processed, redeeming God, reaching us as the Spirit
In the church meetings we need to have the realization that we are actually meeting in the Triune, processed, redeeming, and reaching God
The New Jerusalem shows us that we are God's dwelling place as the tabernacle and that He is our dwelling place as the temple
In eternity future the New Jerusalem will be the tabernacle for God's dwelling and the temple for our dwelling
In Revelation, however, John tells us that the temple in which we worship is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb
In our human spirit He dwells in us who are His tabernacle, and in the divine Spirit we dwell in Him who is our temple
The Triune God, on the one hand, is the light, and the Triune God, on the other hand, is the holder as our Redeemer
In our human spirit He dwells in us, the tabernacle, and we dwell in Him, the divine Spirit reaching us, the temple
The last item that is recorded in the section concerning the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb
God is the One who had a purpose and who made a plan in eternity past and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan
The throne of God and of the Lamb denotes that this throne is to carry out God's plan through Christ's redemption
The throne is the very source from which the river of water of life flows, and it flows with the tree of life growing in it
We have to realize that what is recorded in Revelation 21 and 22 should be experienced by us today in a very personal way
In our Christian experience the unique item should be the throne of the One who purposed and of the One who redeemed
We experience the One on the throne in His headship and lordship, and we submit ourselves to such an authority
In our daily life, in our family life, in our marriage life, in our business life, and in our church life the center must be God's throne
God was the One who purposed, He became the Lamb who redeemed , and finally became the life-giving, flowing Spirit
God flows in the water of life, the Lamb flows in the water of life, and the Spirit flows as the water of life
If you would offer such a prayer to the Triune God every morning, from that moment you would have the living water flowing within you
He flows in you as the One who purposed, as the One who redeemed, and as the One who is the life-giving Spirit
In love Thou in the Son didst flow Among the human race; Thou dost as Spirit also flow Within us through Thy grace
Whatever was accomplished on the cross was objective, and this has to become subjective to us by the flow of the Lamb
Even the Lamb is flowing in this divine flow because this flow proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb
We do not only have such a vision and revelation, but we have this experience day by day and even moment by moment
We were also baptized into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and the name denotes the Person
We were baptized into the Person of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, so after being baptized we are in the Triune God
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we believed into the Triune God and at the same time the Triune God came into us
In the meeting we may say the throne is in us, but many times when the sisters go shopping, the throne is thrown away to the heavens
Many times even in small things such as buying a tie or a pair of shoes, we would not let the throne in our heart
Without the throne, the New Jerusalem does not have a center, and without the throne, there is no flow of life
Whenever you would take the Triune God as your Head, that will be the time when something begins to flow in your being
Even in our talk to our children and in our talk to our spouse, we have to practice submitting ourselves to the inner throne
The water of life will be proceeding out of the throne to supply you and to bring to you the tree of life which nourishes you all day long
The water of life, the flow of the Spirit of life, is the divine life in resurrection for the drink of God's redeemed
Revelation 22:14 is on eating God as the tree of life, and verse 17 of the same chapter is on drinking God as the water of life
Even in the Gospel of John the Lord said that He was the bread of life and that 'he who eats Me shall also live because of Me'
John says that on the last day of the feast Jesus stood and cried out, 'If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink'
When we drink of Him we receive the water of life, and as a result rivers of living water flow out of our innermost being
When the Triune God flows, He becomes the water of life for us to drink, and He grows the tree of life for us to eat
Once you put Him on His throne, immediately the water flows and the tree grows, and you have something to drink and to eat
When you drink the water of life and eat the tree of life, you will serve Him, you will see His face, and you will be a king
The New Jerusalem is not merely objective, nor is it merely something for the future, but it should be subjective in our daily experience
In these final six chapters we will cover the six aspects of the application of the New Jerusalem to the believers
The New Jerusalem is built with these three basic materials, which are the three basic elements for our spiritual constitution
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
Such a 'benediction' does not only bear a sense of enjoyment but also denotes the way we Christians are existing today
He is grace and love to us, and this grace with love is carried on within us in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
The way that we exist is the way that we live, so the fourth aspect of the application is the Triune God as our living
The word triune is a good adjective to describe our spiritual condition, situation, existence, living, and enjoyment
The rock wounded the oyster, stayed in this wound, and the oyster secreted its life-juice around the rock making it a pearl
He did not want others to find him as Saul of Tarsus, a natural, 'rocky' man, but he wanted others to find him in Christ
The lampstand has seven lamps which are the seven Spirits of God shining to express all that the Triune God is
When we enter into the 747, however, we are saved from the wind and the storm and we are on our way to our destination
The same Greek preposition for 'into' is used in Romans 6:3 which tells us that we have been baptized into Christ Jesus
You were once outside of Christ, but when you were baptized into the water, that signified that you were baptized into Christ
Matthew 28:19 indicates that we need to baptize people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit
Vincent indicates in his word study that the preposition 'into' denotes a kind of spiritual and mystical union with the Triune God
When we were baptized into the Triune God, we were baptized into the very Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God
When we baptize people, it should not just be a ceremony or a religious form to accept people into Christianity
We need to tell the ones being baptized that we are not only baptizing them into the water, but also into all that the Triune God is
The Jews believe God, but they believe in an objective God that exists in the universe but has nothing to do with them experientially
We all have to realize this wonderful fact of our baptism, that is, when we were baptized, we entered into the Triune God
Whenever you begin to gossip and you realize that you are in God, this realization will stop you from gossiping
Your abiding is a term or a condition for His abiding in you, and the fulfilling of this condition furthers your entering into Him
When you abide in Him, you realize He is abiding in you and that His abiding is becoming deeper and deeper in you
Colossians indicates that we have received Christ as the mystery of God and that now we have to be rooted in Him
Christ is not superficial like many of today's Christians who 'skate on the ice' of the truth contained in the Bible
The reason why Paul writes in such a redundant and seemingly complicated way is because our God is not that simple
Martin Luther indicated that if a person can explain the mystery of the Triune God, then that person must be the teacher of God
We do know, however, that our God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, not for us to know doctrinally, but for us to experience
Our heart is like a house that has four rooms and these rooms are the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience
As He makes His home downward in our heart we become strong to apprehend with all the saints the breadth length height and depth of Christ
No one knows how wide the breadth is, how long the length is, how high the height is, or how deep the depth is
Eventually, we know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God
When we are filled unto all the fullness of God, this is the complete entering into this wonderful, marvelous, all-inclusive Triune God
When we enter into the Triune God completely, we have entered into the entire constitution of the New Jerusalem
Today many Christians do not like to talk about the church, but in Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus promised that He would build His church
Eventually, He gets into our inward being to such an extent that He has housed Himself in every corner and avenue of our entire being
There is not another type or allegory in the Scriptures which speaks so much about Christ according to our Christian experience
According to the New Testament revelation, we believers have two lives-the Adamic life and God's life, the divine life
Many times, however, when the sisters go shopping, this is another living which is something different in nature from God's nature
We may have the feeling that our children are loving and innocent, but at times we all have to admit that our children are 'ugly'
The reason why they are ugly is because all of us human beings have an ugly nature which we inherited from Adam
Our natural nature is ugly, but thank the Lord that through the second birth, regeneration, we received another nature, the divine nature
The New Testament denotation, however, is mainly on the aspect of being built up, and to build up is to constitute
To be educated is altogether a matter of knowledge in the mentality and not a matter of being built up with some element
To be built up is to receive more and more of the divine element which becomes your constituent to constitute you
Today's Christianity is mostly a religion of knowledge, theology, biblical teaching, regulation, adjustment, and character improvement
Not many Christians have the thought that they need to be constituted with the Triune God and not merely taught
All the mothers know that they have to teach their children, but the main thing that they do is feed their children
If a mother would merely teach her children day and night for two weeks without feeding them, the children would not be able to live
Mothers are not so bothered by their child being naughty, but they are really bothered when their child does not eat
When we look at the New Jerusalem we cannot see any doctrine or anything concerning the theology of the Trinity
Even our physical body receives some nourishing element into it every day, which eventually becomes our body's intrinsic element
The allegory of the New Jerusalem is quite marvelous because it shows us what we could not see outwardly- the intrinsic elements
These three elements are in our being working in us, and they are the very intrinsic elements which constitute our spiritual being
We have seen that gold in typology always refers to God's divine nature, and Peter told us that we are partakers of the divine nature
The city proper is like a mountain with the height of twelve thousand stadia, and Revelation 21:18 tells us that the city was pure gold
Since we as the children of God have the divine nature, this divine nature should spontaneously be our street and our walkway
Our Christian life should not be regulated by a church code or by a written regulation, but by the divine nature as our unique street
There is not a code which says that the members of the church should not gamble, but the divine nature within us will not allow us to gamble
He has also given us great promises in both the Old and New Testaments to enable us to partake of this golden nature
In Matthew 6 the Lord Jesus tells us not to be anxious concerning our life, which involves what we eat, what we drink, and what we put on
Finally, the Lord charges us to 'seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you'
The Lord Jesus, however, promised us that if we seek His kingdom and His righteousness, He will take care of our needs
Through the promises of God we can enjoy the divine nature, and by this the divine nature develops and grows from one state to another
If you are anxious about your children, tell God, and the peace of God will guard your heart and your thoughts
When we appropriate and apply God's promises, the divine nature has a way to constitute our being and grow within us
The second aspect of the triune constitution is the pearls which are produced through the secretion of Christ's resurrection life
When we stay in the death of Christ, Christ's resurrection life secretes itself over us, making all of us pearls
When you say that you have been crucified with Christ, this means that you admit that you have been crucified on the cross
When you stay, remain, and abide in Christ's death, then it is no longer you that live but Christ that lives in you
If we stay in the death of Christ every day for five to ten years, we will eventually become a 'big round pearl'
Sometimes because our stay in the death of Christ was a little short, His secretion of His resurrection life over us was not complete
When others looked at us, they saw that we were pearls, but they also could still see 'the rock' of our fallen nature
As pieces of rock, we need to abide in the death of Christ and enjoy the rich, thick secretion of His resurrection life to make us pearls
The rock is not made into a pearl by being taught, but by being constituted with the resurrection life of Christ through His death
When you take this fact and stay in this fact, admitting that you are dead in Him, you will be staying in His death
As long as you stay here, the resurrected Christ will secrete His resurrection life around you to make you a pretty pearl
In order to see the transforming work of the Spirit to make us precious stones we need to look at our experience
The secretion of the resurrection life of Christ is good for our entering into the Triune God, but transformation is good for building
John was looking for the temple in the New Jerusalem, but he saw no temple because the temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb
In Ephesians 4 the existence of the New Jerusalem has been applied to us already and is still being applied to us
Day by day we who are in the church, in the Body, are enjoying this application of the existence of the New Jerusalem
When the Trinity reaches us, He is the Spirit; therefore, Paul begins with the Spirit as the reaching aspect of the divine Trinity
When the Spirit reaches you, the Lord is with you since there is no separation between the three of the divine Trinity
You may think that it is easy to understand that God is over you and in you, but can you explain what it means for God to be through you?
As the originator, He created us in the old creation, and as the source, He regenerated us in the new creation to be the church
Ephesians 2:15 tells us that through the death of Christ in the flesh, one new man has been created and this new man is the Body
We have already seen in chapter thirty-eight that when we submit to the inner throne, we experience the flow of the divine life
If we are going to enjoy the triune existence applied to us today, we should be under God's authority, under His sovereignty
Today, however, we have to realize that God is our authority and we have to submit ourselves under His authority
We should not be like the unbelievers who do not want to be under anybody, but we are the believers having God over us as our authority
The young saints among us especially need to ask themselves whether God has gotten through in them in certain matters
For God to be over us, through us, and in us is experiential and subjective that we may enjoy His presence as our existence
Paul, however, unveils the very God of the Body of Christ who is over the Body, through the Body, and in the Body
We need to be honest before the Lord to allow this word to 'check us out' so that we can see where we really are
Daily we must be under Him, daily we must let Him go through us, and daily we must give Him our inner room that He may stay in us
These gates are the magnification of Christ, and today we must exist in a way that Christ is magnified in our existence
When He is living in us, He is surely secreting His resurrection life around us, making us pearls, and these pearls are His magnification
Since the Spirit has regenerated us, this regenerating Spirit has become the very substance and the very essence of the church
He is now transforming us with the divine element, which is being added to us to replace and discharge the old element of our old nature
These verses show us how the church can exist with the Triune God, with the Father, with the Lord, and with the Spirit
They contend that it is a heresy to say that a person is mingled with God and that this is to make yourself God
He was a genuine, perfect man with a stomach to digest food, with tears to shed, and with blood to shed on the cross for our sins
To say that we have been born of God, though, and that we have the life of God and the nature of God is a divine, scriptural fact
The fact that we have been born of God means that we have God's life and God's nature and that we are the sons of God
If you say that you are God and that you are deified with His deity and Godhead to be an object of worship, this is heresy
If you say that you are like God in your being , having His life and nature, this is the truth according to the divine revelation
The New Testament tells us that the Lord Jesus is God and the Son of God; also the Lord Jesus is man as well as the Son of Man
When you use the word deified, though, if you mean that you have been made God in His Godhead to be an object of worship, this is heresy
We have received His life and His nature, and we are now partakers of the divine nature, enjoying the divine nature daily
We can see God in the New Jerusalem in His Trinity, and we can see ourselves in the New Jerusalem in a triune way
Our entry into the New Jerusalem is triune our constitution is triune our existence is triune and now we must see that our living is triune
Individually we are a small New Jerusalem and corporately as the church life we are also a miniature New Jerusalem
In Revelation 22:1, however, we see God and the Lamb which signifies that God is now the redeeming God, no longer merely the creating God
On the top of this high mountain is a throne and One is sitting on this throne who is both God and man, the redeeming God
God the Father is the source, God the Son is the redeeming element, and the throne of God is the element of the divine authority
Today we must see that we need to take God as our source with His redeeming element and with the element of His divine authority
We also live with the Father as love , the nature of God's essence, and as light , the nature of God's expression
Just have a time absolutely for you to contact the source of the divine life to remain in the divine fellowship
You will enjoy God the Father as the source of life, as love, the nature of His essence, and as light, the nature of His expression
We live with the Father as the fountain and we live with the Son as life and as the life supply, the tree of life
At times our praying for many things frustrates us from the enjoyment of the Son as our life and as our life supply
Sometimes our prayer to the Lord is in a 'pitiful way,' where we complain about our negative situation or environment
Paul enjoyed Christ even in prison because he was enjoying the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ for his daily salvation
The more you call on the Lord, the more you have the Spirit within you as the realization of Christ, the Spirit of reality
The electrical current is actually the electricity itself, but if the electricity is not moving it cannot be applied
We may say that the Father is the power plant, the Son is the electricity, and the Spirit is the current of electricity
The Spirit of life is also the water of life , and we live with the Spirit as the water of life for the bountiful supply of the Triune God
The Son growing is the life supply and the Spirit flowing is the bountiful supply of the Triune God to support the entire city
Since such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it has no need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man
An electrical light always needs a bulb or a lamp to contain it; otherwise, there is the possibility of a person being electrocuted
Outside of Christ, God's shining is a kind of killing, but inside of Christ God's shining is a kind of illumination
Since the day we were saved, we began to enjoy God as the divine light in the redeeming Christ illumining us all the time
We do not need philosophy, the human-made light, and we do not need ethical teachings such as that of Confucius
Do you not have a divine light in you all day long shining within you to let you know that you have to honor your parents?
He talks about the relationship between wife and husband, between children and parents, and between slaves and masters
If we would care for the new creation and the inner anointing all the time, there would be no need of teaching
Because we are in the old creation, however, many times we need some teaching to remind us to awake from our sleep
As long as you have the very God who is light to you in your fellowship with Him, there is no need of anything else
God as the divine light shines within and through the redeeming Christ, and this shining enlightens the entire city
Corinthians 3:18 says we are being transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory
A certain saint may be a very good person, but he may still be opaque and not transparent because he remains in the old creation so much
He will not only be the nature of the New Jerusalem but He will also be the shining light as an enjoyment to the entire city
When we open our entire being to Him, however, we are in the light, and the light is God Himself enjoyed by us in our daily life
God the Father made an eternal plan , He sent the Son and the Son came with Him to accomplish His plan on the cross
We have the flow of the water of life within us when we are living, behaving, and having our life according to God's divine nature
If you do not walk in the divine nature as the divine street, you are dried up because there is no riverbed for the flow of the street
If you do this, you will immediately have the sense that you are no longer dried up, but that a river is flowing within you
For God the Father to be our light, we need the redeeming Christ, and for God the Spirit to be our river, we need the divine nature
In Revelation 22:14 is a promise of the tree of life, and in Revelation 22:17 is a calling to the water of life
We all need to be enjoying God the Father as the light, God the Spirit as the river, and God the Son as the tree in a daily way
If the church in a certain locality is not enjoyable, this is because the light is dim, and the river and the tree are absent
Today we can enjoy such a Triune God, and this Triune God will be our triune enjoyment in full in the New Jerusalem
In the New Jerusalem the city is a mountain of gold with pearl gates and with a jasper wall built upon twelve layers of precious stones
The expression of God the Father as the source of all the divine riches is based upon His nature typified by gold
God Himself is signified as gold in His intrinsic nature and God being light denotes His nature in His expression
The triune expression of the Father as the source of all the divine riches is based upon His golden nature in His shining glory
Revelation tells us that the city itself is gold and that the street of the city is pure gold as transparent glass
In your daily life, family life, business life, and church life, others should be able to see the divine gold, the divine shining glory
If you behave yourself in a clever, human, and political way, people will not be able to sense any divine nature in your behavior
The Bible does not teach us ethical things in the natural way; the Bible is a revelation unveiling what kind of walk we should take
The second aspect of the triune expression is the expression of the Son as the embodiment of all the divine riches
The Son, being the Lamb in His Person, is the lamp to express all that the Father is as the light and as the source of the divine riches
A light bulb is the embodiment of the electrical light, or you may say it is the embodiment of the electrical riches
Because we are under the shining of the Son as the embodiment of all the divine riches, we can enjoy these riches
In the lamp is the Person of the Son shining and expressing the Triune God, but in the pearls is the Son's work of death and resurrection
When the oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl
The oyster's wound typifies the death of Christ and the life secretion of the oyster signifies the secretion of Christ's resurrection life
Paul tells us in Galatians 2:20 that he has been crucified with Christ and it is no longer he that lives but Christ lives in him
If a husband and wife would live according to themselves and not according to Christ, they may argue frequently
The lamp refers to the Son's Person, the pearls refer to His work of death and resurrection, and the tree refers to His nourishment
The Triune God reaches us in this river and this reaching of the Triune God is the realization of all the divine riches
God, the Lamb, the throne, the divine nature as the divine way, and Christ with all His unsearchable riches are wrapped up with this flow
In Revelation we first see that this all-inclusive Spirit is the seven Spirits as the seven lamps of the golden lampstand
We should be those who are being constituted with the Triune God, existing with the Triune God, and living with the Triune God
God as light shines from within the Lamb as the lamp through the city as the light-bearer to express Himself as the glory
The throne is the center , the street is the way , the river is the river of the water of life , and the tree is the tree of life
From the throne as the center spirals the street as the way to pass through the entire city and to reach all its twelve gates
