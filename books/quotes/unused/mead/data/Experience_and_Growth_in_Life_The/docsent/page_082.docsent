   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AS A LIFE WITH THE PROCESSED AND DISPENSING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Christian life is a life in which God's chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and saved people live together with the processed and dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Christian life is something particular.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not everybody can live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only we who have been chosen, redeemed, and saved by God can live together with the processed and dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a life in the principle of incarnation, and it is a mingled life, a life in which God and man are mingled together.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In whatever we do, we have to realize that we are persons mingled with the processed and dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are exchanging words with our spouse, we must realize that God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This will stop the exchange of words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are going to a certain place, we must remember that we are persons mingled with God and that God is going with us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we are reminded that we are mingled with Him, it seems that it is we who are remembering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, our remembering at this time does not actually come from us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It comes from Christ as our Partner, who is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When an unbeliever goes to a movie theater, he does not have the thought that God is going with him because he does not have Christ as his Partner.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, wherever we go, we have a Partner.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are particular, peculiar persons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Wherever we are, we are not alone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Another One is with us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Many Christians can testify of their experience of God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Certain persons used to gamble before they were saved, but after being saved, they were no longer able to gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As an unbeliever I spent much time playing soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After I was saved, I continued to play soccer because I felt it was not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, one day when the ball came to me on the soccer field, I felt as if I could not use my foot to kick it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I turned and walked off the field.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From that time on I never went back to play soccer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even at that time I did not consciously realize that I was not alone and that the Lord Jesus was with me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I thought it was I alone who was walking off the field.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many Christians have had a similar experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We did not realize that it was not merely we who acted, but the processed and dispensing God, who is Christ consummated as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christian life is a life that we, the God-chosen, redeemed, and saved people, live together with the processed and dispensing God, a life lived by two persons mingled together and living together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether or not we intend to live such a life, as long as we are Christians, especially seeking Christians, we are living with Christ as the all-inclusive embodiment of the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if we would repent of being Christians, it is too late.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Something has gotten into us, and we can never be rid of it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's recovery is to recover such a life, that the God-chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and saved people may live together, consciously or unconsciously, intentionally or unintentionally, with the processed and dispensing God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we live such a life, we declare that we are chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not persons of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are persons of the choosing, redeeming, regenerating, and saving God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We declare that the processed and dispensing God lives with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only do we live with Him, but He lives with us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before we were saved, we may have rarely asked ourselves if what we were doing was proper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may have thought that everything we did was right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, however, the Lord often interrupts us and questions us about what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may think that we are asking ourselves this question.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, we must realize that it is not merely we, but our Partner who is asking it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our Partner is one with us and sometimes appears to be us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the first part of this verse, the "I" is the old man; in the second part, the "I" is a new person who is one with Christ as his Partner.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is always One within us who reminds us that we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before I was saved, I could do things without limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now, however, I am a different person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sometimes when I have laughed too much, my Partner questioned whether my laughter was of the Spirit, and my laughter stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before I was saved, when I lost my temper, I lost it without constraint.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, after I was saved, I experienced that while I was losing my temper, there was something within me restraining me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Experiences such as these prove we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is here, not only with us, but one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He lives with us in our living, and He is waiting for our cooperation, that our living would be one with His.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In John 14:19 Jesus said, "Because I live, you shall live also."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Apparently, the Lord lives by Himself and we live by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, John 14:16-20 tells us that we live together.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When He lives, we live in His living, and when we live, He lives in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a deep mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Apparently, John 14:19 is a simple word, but its significance is very deep.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The very God lives together with man, the sinful and dirtied man who has been chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah, we were chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We did not choose Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, we may have rejected Him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We cannot explain what happened to cause us to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It was not up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We simply changed our mind and called on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Now we are persons who are mingled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we go along with Him, we are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we do not go along with Him, we have no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christians are not always a people of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many times we are bothered by something within.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We may even spend more time being troubled than resting.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The One who troubles us is our Partner.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Because of our Partner, we are here in the church and have dropped many things to concentrate ourselves on the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we realize what the Christian life is, we are truly blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is our rest and our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Unconsciously and spontaneously, we are living a life with God.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we live, He lives.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we speak, He speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Wherever we go, He goes also.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We cannot deny this reality, and we cannot reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Christian life does not need our strife and struggle to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Struggling in this way can produce results only for a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We simply should live a life with God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Paul said, "For to me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In his living, he was one with Christ, living Christ and expressing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Eventually, it will be no longer we who live, but Christ who lives in us.</S>
