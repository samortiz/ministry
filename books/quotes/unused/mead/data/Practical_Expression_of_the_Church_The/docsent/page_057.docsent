   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In many places among the brothers and sisters, hardly one is equipped both with standing and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some have the standing without the ability, and others have the ability without the standing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps a brother who is very keen and much improved in the Lord has had two marriages before he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He is really one with the Lord and among all the brothers he is the most improved in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But how could he get rid of that blot on his history?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is always there, and because of the standard of the church, it is evidently not good for one with such a background to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some may say that others then should take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But perhaps he who has the standing is just like plain water: he is neither sweet nor salty; he cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you ask him to take the lead, he simply cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So we need more mercy and grace, with more experience in life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two brothers must work together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The one with the most improvement in the spirit must realize that though he has such an amount of spiritual ability, he has apparently lost the standard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He must realize where he stands and be faithful to the Lord in a covered way to be one with his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He must be faithful to God's grace and never take the lead, for he realizes his standing has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he would take it, he would damage the church and lower the standard of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He must therefore in faithfulness to the Lord do whatever he can to support his brother and be one with his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The plain brother, then, must realize that though he has the standing, he is not capable of bearing the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Though he may be willing, yet he does not have the ability; so he needs the other brother.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two brothers must therefore become one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They really need the mercy and grace of the Lord with much experience in life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the one who is spiritual and improved in the spirit considers the brother in the lead and says that he is not qualified, the whole church life is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He must be one with his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all must realize that we are definitely in a kind of abnormal situation today.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all must look to the Lord for more experience in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, in this time of abnormality, scarcely one among us is much qualified and equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, several need to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A brother may have the standing and that is all.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If he must make a decision, he must come to two other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If he must say something, he will not know what to say; therefore, he must come to these two brothers and pray with them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He becomes their mouth, and they become his light the three become one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the remedy for today's abnormal situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Moreover, we should not make the government in the churches so legal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not say that since these are the elders, let them do the job right or resign!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have this attitude, it will damage the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that though the present leading ones may not be so qualified, we should not be so legal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They are still the leading ones; so let them take their position.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should do all we can to support them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no need for a change; we should do everything we can to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And the leading ones must realize that they are not so capable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They should not make the situation so legal in such a way that everything must be in their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here we need the mercy and grace of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone among us must be faithful to the Lord, and everyone must learn that we do need the government in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I may be more capable than all those who are in the government, yet I realize that under the Lord's sovereignty I am not in the government.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, I become so submissive to the government.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Though the leading ones in the government are not as qualified as I may be, yet I do whatever I can to support them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I should not have any thought that some day the Lord will remove the present leading ones, and I will be one of the leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No, I should be submissive to the present government and support it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the attitude we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The leading ones must realize that they should not control anything in the church in a legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This does not mean to surrender the order, but it does mean that there is no legality.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everyone is in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For instance, in some places, the leading ones think that because they are the leaders, they must start the meeting; if the leaders have not yet arrived at the meeting, no one should start.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If some of the others begin the meeting, the leaders become angry.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They like to hold everything so legally in their hand.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then there are others who say that the leading ones restrict the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They feel that everybody can do anything they like according to the Holy Spirit; therefore, they do not need leaders.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I have been so happy with our meetings here in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not have any regulations in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everyone is free to start the meeting, but there is no kind of disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I believe that this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you say that there is no government, I will say strongly that there is a government.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you say that the church in Los Angeles is out of control and everybody is so free, I will say that the church in Los Angeles is very much under control.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if you say that there is a government with a certain kind of control, I will not admit this.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no control.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I will say a hundred times that no one controls.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What I mean is this: We do have a government here, but we do not have a legal government.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We do not like to have anything legal, neither do we like to have anything in disorder.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We like everything to be in order.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We like everything to be in order, but not with legality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This requires more and more grace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A CHANGE IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we all have learned the lesson of grace, wherever we go, we will simply go to the church on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then when we get into that local church, we will submit ourselves to the situation and not question anything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>By the Lord's leading we will do our best to minister life to others and support the government of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This will build up the church and give ground to the Lord for Him to do something more.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When King David was young, he was in an abnormal situation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But he learned the lesson, and this paved the way for the Lord to come in. Therefore, the Lord was able to put him into the position of king.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we have the grace and learn the lesson of life, someday the Lord will put the responsibility on our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He will bring us into the government of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But this must be the sovereign move of the Lord, not something brought about by our manipulation.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In the church, any replacement or change in the government may cause a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We do not need an outward change, but we do need a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Perhaps in the church in certain places, the leading ones are not as qualified and as living as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But you must be faithful to the Lord to minister life, submit yourself to the leading ones, and do whatever you can to support and help the present government.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This will minister more life to the whole church, and this life will bring about a change in life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Perhaps after a few more years, spontaneously some of the present leaders will be moved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then in life you and some others who are experienced in life will be put into the leading position by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It will not be something done by human hands, but by the sovereign, divine hand.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It will be something in life, and it will not cause any damage to the church life.</S>
