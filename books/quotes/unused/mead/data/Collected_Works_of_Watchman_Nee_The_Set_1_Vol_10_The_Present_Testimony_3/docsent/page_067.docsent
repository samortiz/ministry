   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE POWER OF PRESSURE Issue No. 31 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 1:8-10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 Corinthians 1:8-10, what did Paul want the brothers to know?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He wanted them to know of the affliction which befell him in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What was the nature of this affliction?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was the affliction of being under pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To what degree were they pressed by this pressure?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were pressed beyond their power, to the point that they despaired even of living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the outward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And what was the inward feeling?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He said that they "had the response of death" in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The final outcome was this: "We should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead; who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have paid special attention in our Lord's Day morning messages to the principles of spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we will talk about the relationship between pressure and power, or we may say, between compression and power.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, Christians pay considerable attention to the matter of power.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among spiritual believers, even more attention is paid to the matter of power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They often ask whether or not a certain person has power and whether his power is great or small.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wherever we are, we hear this kind of talk.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We want to consider the biblical teaching concerning the relationship between pressure, or compression, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First I want to say that pressure and power are directly proportional one to the other.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Where there is pressure, there is power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a Christian does not know pressure, he cannot know power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only those who have experienced the stress of pressure can understand power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The more pressure one experiences, the more power he has, and the more he understands power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before I explain the spiritual relationship between pressure and power, I want to point out their relationship in physical terms, so that we can understand the spiritual principle from physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you ever seen how water boils on the stove?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must have seen how boiled water is sold in a boiled-water shop.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Water is boiled from morning until evening, all year round.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The shop is always filled with steam, but the steam is not very useful because it does not have much power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the other hand, if you look at a boiler on a train engine or ship, you can see an intense fire under the boiler.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The water in the boiler is boiling, but the steam cannot easily escape because the boiler is made of very thick steel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The steam is kept inside the boiler and gradually accumulates.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because of the external pressure and the fact that no steam is allowed to escape, the steam is pressurized to become a source of power.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the power of this steam is released through a small hole, it can drive trains and ships forward with great speed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In both cases we have steam.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But why is there such a great difference in the power they produce?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the boiled-water shop, the steam is useless, but in a train or a ship, it is useful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In one case the steam is not compressed; it is scattered and, therefore, useless.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the other case the steam is compressed; it is not scattered, and when this compressed steam is released from one outlet, it becomes a source of great power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers, this principle is not only true in physics; it is also true as a spiritual law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever there is no pressure, there is no power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only pressure can produce power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a Christian wants to understand what power is, he must first understand what pressure is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Pressure or stress was always upon the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They were pressed daily, were under tension daily, and bore heavy burdens daily.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, they were continually occupied so that they could neither live quietly nor peacefully.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This, however, was the means by which God bestowed power upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The apostles were pressed so much that their power multiplied to the point that it became unmatched by anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Pressure forced them to rely upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Brothers, how much pressure is upon you?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You can only measure your power by your pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The pressure of the boiler determines the power of the steam.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There has never been a believer whose power was greater than the pressure he experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a believer wants to measure how much power he has before God, he should know that his power is only equal to the pressure he experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This law is never violated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times believers pray, "God, please give me power."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do they know what they are praying for?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If God responds to their prayer, He will cause them to be pressed, because God knows that the power of life can only be produced from the pressure of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A life that is pressured is a life that has power.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A life without pressure is a life without power.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A life with great pressure is a life with great power.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A life with a little pressure is a life with little power.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The power I am referring to here is the power of life and not the power of anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now we want to take a look at some spiritual matters to prove the accuracy of the principle that pressure is power.</S>
