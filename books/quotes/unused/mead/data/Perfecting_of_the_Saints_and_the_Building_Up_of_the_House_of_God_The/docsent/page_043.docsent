   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING BEING USEFUL IN THE LORD S HAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to fellowship concerning our usefulness in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As those who serve the Lord, our usefulness is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We want to have spiritual weight, but we must realize that spiritual weight is for us to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As we serve the Lord, the most important matter is our usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Over the years the Lord has used us for His work on this island.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we have limited the Lord much more than we have been used by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, we have not been as useful as we could have been, because there are problems that hinder our usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These problems limit the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we all need to go before the Lord to see how we limit Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all limit the Lord in one way or another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may limit the Lord in one way, in a few ways, or in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Consequently, we are used by the Lord on the one hand, but we limit Him on the other.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of being greatly used by the Lord, we are used only in a limited way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This proves that there are problems in our usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not resolve these problems, we will always limit the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our Heart Being Enlarged</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The heart of the Lord s worker must be enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A worker must have a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This does not mean that we should be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Things in the world and in human society are often full of contradictions.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, a person with a small heart is more likely to be proud, but a person with a large heart is less likely to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It may seem that a person with a large heart would be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, a person who is truly enlarged is not proud, but a person who is small and fine is often proud.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The smaller a person s heart is, the prouder he tends to be, and the larger a person s heart is, the humbler he tends to be.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To have an enlarged heart does not mean to be proud.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It means that a person s heart is as inclusive and broad as God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Solomon is an example of a person with a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 1 Kings God gave Solomon largeness of heart and wisdom 4:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Most believers know that God gave Solomon wisdom 3:9, 12 , but they do not know that God also gave Solomon a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Kings 4:29 says that largeness of heart is like the sand on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The seashore encloses the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, God gave Solomon a heart that is larger than the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Everyone who is truly wise has a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A person with a narrow heart is foolish, but a person with a large heart is wise.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A large heart and wisdom cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A wise person has a large and broad heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God gave Solomon wisdom by giving him a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A person who has a large heart is inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A person who aspires to be great or to do a great work does not have a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>None of us should have the thought to be great or to do a great work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, as those who serve the Lord, we must learn to let God enlarge our heart so that we are considerate of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we are concerned with what is on God s heart, our concern will match God s concern, and our intention will match God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is closely related to our capacity and affects our usefulness in God s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some people aim too high and are not realistic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is not a large heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These believers dream of the day when they are able to lead a multitude of sinners to salvation and perfect many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To have such thoughts is to give free rein to fantasy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is to have a heart that is not large.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must learn to come before the Lord, be calm, and allow Him to enlarge our heart so that we consider His heart and care for what He cares for.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then our spiritual knowledge and learning will not be one-sided; instead, it will have many sides.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>An enlarged heart is not one-sided.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A person who is one-sided can be compared to an unturned cake Hosea 7:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With time he becomes spiritually unbalanced and deficient.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A spiritually unbalanced believer does not have an enlarged heart.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If our heart is enlarged, we will not be unbalanced in our spiritual knowledge and learning.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, we will not be unbalanced in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Every worker should have a particular ministry, but we should not focus on our ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should be general rather than specialized.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is better to know a little of everything than to know only one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the young saints begin to serve the Lord, it is better for them to learn to be general.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the way that students are taught in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A medical student must study every field.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He studies the ear, nose, and throat, the eyes, internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He must learn everything.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After he has a solid base of medical knowledge, he can specialize in one area.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He would have serious problems in the future if he were to begin his medical training by specializing in one area.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, it is necessary for him to first study general subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Those who are beginning to serve the Lord must learn to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not say that we want only to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is our preference and not the result of being enlarged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must be enlarged by God until we are willing to learn to pray, read the Lord s Word, touch the inner sense, fellowship with the saints, be proper deacons, and even learn to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should not despise our youth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Not only so, the brothers should learn to do the things that the sisters do, and the sisters should learn to do the things that the brothers do.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we begin to serve the Lord, we must begin with general practice.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If after seven years we know only how to read the Bible or how to enter our private room and pray, we will not be useful in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The best preparation for one who serves the Lord is for him to endeavor to learn as many things as possible in the first ten years of his service.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Any believer who wants to learn how to serve the Lord should be helped to learn every service.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It may be that he learns one service for two months and then another service for another two months.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is important for him to learn to do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If he serves in this way, after a while he will be clear concerning the focus of his service.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A believer who is restricted to a particular service is not very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A believer who is useful is not restricted in his service.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He can be specialized in one thing but not restricted to one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, he does many things and functions in many areas so that he is not limited in his ministry.</S>
