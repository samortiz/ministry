The Mark of Self-control Being Seen<br />in One's Words</h2><p>Verse 2 says, "For in many things we all stumble. If anyone does not stumble in word, this one is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well." Whether or not a person can bridle himself depends on whether he can bridle his words. Whether or not a person has self-control&mdash;a fruit of the Spirit&mdash;depends on whether he can bridle his words. Many brothers and sisters misunderstand the Bible. They think that self-control is moderation. Please keep in mind that self-control is self-control. The teaching of moderation has nothing to do with us. Christians should exercise self-control, which means that they should control themselves.</p><p>Self-control is a fruit of the Spirit. Galatians 5 shows us what the fruit of the Spirit is, while James tells us what the mark of the fruit of the Spirit is. James says a person who is able to bridle his whole body is surely able to bridle his words. Those who are loose in their words are loose in their living. Those who speak foolishly conduct themselves foolishly. A person who is indiscreet with words is surely indiscreet in everything he does. A person who has many words is bound to be a careless person before God. Whether or not a person can bridle his whole body depends on whether he can bridle his mouth. I hope that from now on all the new believers will learn to bridle their words before God.</p><p>Many brothers and sisters pray for God to deal with them and to grant them mercy. I will say a word to them: If God can deal with your speaking, He can deal with you. There are many people whose speaking constitutes the very life of their being. Their speaking represents their strength, the very hollow of their thigh. If God can deal with their speaking, He can deal with their whole being. Many people have not been defeated by God in their speaking. As a result, their very being has not been defeated by God. If a man has no self-control over himself, he may act in certain ways. But once others talk to him for half an hour, they realize the kind of person he is. As soon as a man opens his mouth, his very being is exposed. Nothing exposes a person more than his words. As soon as a man speaks, his very being is fully exposed. If you want to see whether a man can control himself, simply ask if he can control his speaking.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Smallest Affecting the Greatest</h2><p>Verse 3 takes a bridle for an illustration, while verse 4 takes a rudder for an illustration. The tongue is like a bridle. It is also like a rudder. It is the smallest thing, yet it can exert the greatest influence. Verse 5 says the smallest fire can ignite a great forest. Verse 6 says, "And the tongue is a fire; the very world of unrighteousness, the tongue is set among our members as that which contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life and is set on fire by Gehenna." Verse 3 speaks of a bridle. Verse 4 speaks of a rudder. Verse 5 says that the tongue is a little member that boasts great things. Verse 6 shows us that the tongue is a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is a world of its own, a world of unrighteousness. Many people are redeemed; they have experienced God's mercy, yet their tongues have never been bridled. Everywhere they go, they ignite the fire of Gehenna with this world of unrighteousness.</p><p>This is a strong word: The tongue can set on fire the wheel of nature (v. 6, ASV). Life is like a wheel; it is turning all the time. The tongue is like a fire that can set the wheel of life on fire. This means that it can stir up all kinds of fleshly activities. Man's wrath, flesh, temper, and anger can all be ignited by the tongue. The tongue can ignite the fire of Gehenna. Many troubles flare up through words by God's children. That is truly something from Gehenna. The tongue is an igniting fire and is a world of unrighteousness.</p><p>We must learn to diminish our words. The less words we speak, the better we are. There is transgression in the multitude of words. Proverbs advises us to have few words. Only fools are profuse in words. The more foolish a person is, the more words he has. The more lessons a person has learned before God, the more steadfast he is and the fewer words he has.</p><h2 class="head2">D. The Tongue Being a Restless Evil</h2><p>James 3:7 says that every living thing can be tamed, while verse 8 says that no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. The tongue cannot be tamed by man. It is full of deadly poison. It is an untamed evil, "a restless evil." There are evils that can be tamed, but the evil of the tongue cannot be tamed. How foolish it is to loosen one's tongue! If a man relaxes his tongue, he is a very foolish man indeed.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 50: Messages for Building Up New Believers (3) &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
