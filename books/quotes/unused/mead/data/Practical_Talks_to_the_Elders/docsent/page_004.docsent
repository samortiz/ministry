   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO EVALUATE Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I surely hope, brothers, that we all here will be desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, have mercy upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Show me where I am.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Am I in this kind of living?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In my participation in the eldership, in the leadership, do I bear such a testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How about my participation in the care of the church do I have such a realization?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As we pray in this way, we may sense that our testimony is dim, vague, weak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may bear a testimony, but it may not be that excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Don t check anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just check yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How much is my daily life, my service to the Lord, my worship to God, my care of the church, and my fellowship with all the saints in this realization?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Am I in such a reality that, even if I talk with the saints about ordinary things, I bear a striking sign that my being, my person, my life, my living is all in this focus of God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I preach the gospel, do I preach it in this focus?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I open up the Bible to teach, do I do it in this focus?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I go to shepherd an older one or a younger one, a new one or sick one, a weak one or a backsliding one, is my shepherding in this focus?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How about our meetings?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We like them to be living, yet we still have to check.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Just because many are functioning, does that make the meeting living?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Of course it is living in some way, but is that livingness the expression of the golden lampstand?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is it in the focus of God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A meeting might seem high, but in what is it high?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Is it high in the Lord s focus?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christianity has been on this earth close to twenty centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have many practices, many works.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What do they bear as a testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do they have the real focus of God s economy as a testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They have many different kinds of practices, all with their special atmosphere and particular emphasis.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But do you think there is any place among them with a group of Christians bearing a testimony which corresponds to the mystery of the faith?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What shall we say about the meetings of the churches in the Lord s recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When people come to our meetings, what is there for them to be impressed with?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am concerned that our meetings may not have the testimony of the very shining of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This troubles me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Without such a reality in our church meetings, brothers, what we are practicing is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are enough Christian practices.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no need for another one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nor is there any need for another Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These things have been on the earth for centuries, yet the Lord still has no way to come back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no need to say the Lord is not satisfied; I don t think any one of us is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to what the Lord has shown us in these years, the situation among Christians today is far off.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may not be off, but we are still quite far from the standard of the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps we are on the way, but I don t know where we are.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are we halfway, or a third or a fourth of the way?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I don t have the confidence that when I go to a church meeting there will be the focus of the Lord s central lane, of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>LOOKING BACK</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why am I so burdened?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Let us trace a little of our history.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The recovery in the United States began in Los Angeles in 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For ten years, from 1962 to 1972, I had very little concern.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My only burden was to keep pressing on.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This burden was with me from the first conference in the winter of 1963 on the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>During those ten years nothing happened that was a cause of concern to me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some things did happen, but I was not troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the migrations began in 1970.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the two years from 1970 to 1972 the migrations did bring in much blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The number increased, I believe more than doubled, within those two years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then we became careless, or, more accurately, distracted.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We were distracted from what the Lord had shown us, and turned our attention to the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>From 1972 there was a tendency to promote numbers, to be occupied with getting the proper place and the proper people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That opened the door for some things to creep in to damage the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>From 1973 for at least five years we were in a somewhat drugged situation, even though the ministry never deviated from the central lane.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To some the focus was lost; the central lane was left.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There was talk, for instance, about what kind of meetings to have.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In such talk there was little concern about how to have the focus of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord was sovereign, however.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In due time He cleared up the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then I began to say that we must turn our attention away from the increase and come back to the central lane, the lane of life, the lane of God s focus.</S>
