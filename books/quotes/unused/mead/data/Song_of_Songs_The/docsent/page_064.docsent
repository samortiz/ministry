   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What can be crueler than Sheol?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A person may be the most lovable one, the most adorable one, or the most precious one, but when Sheol comes to claim a sinner, it will not care if such a one is lovable or adorable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No tears, sorrow, or pleading can move its heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It does not know mercy and compassion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It has no sympathy or feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is cruel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Since I have consecrated myself to You as a chaste virgin, if You see anything in me that stirs up Your jealousy, You will surely deal with it at all cost until You completely prevail.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There may be loving friends, close relatives, or dear lovers begging, pleading, and weeping, but You do not care for any of these things; You only care for Your own feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But this is the only way that I will be preserved.""The coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Jehovah is a fire Heb 12:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His love and jealousy are also like fire which burns up everything that can be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everything that is not eternal, that can pass away, that is of the world, and that is of man will be burned away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 7 says, "Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Many waters" signify trials that believers go through.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Floods" signify persecutions from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His love and the fire of His love will not be quenched by trials.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His love and the fire of His love cannot be drowned by persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If He loves us, no trial or persecution can do anything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This love cannot be bought with money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, it is irreplaceable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We cannot replace this love with the tongues of men and angels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot replace this love with the gift of prophecy, the knowledge of mysteries, all knowledge, or all faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if we doled out all our possessions to feed others and delivered up our body so that we might boast, we would still be despised.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These things are merely part of the treasures of a man's house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Trying to exchange love for these things will result in being despised.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since this is the case, we will not earn His love with more work, busy times, or toiling services.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can only offer ourselves to Him so that we will become the object of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 8 says, "We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who lives in the Lord's love cannot forget that there are others who should have the Lord's love also.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before she goes away to see the Lord, she remembers those who are less mature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She speaks of her little sister, who has life, but whose faith and love have not grown to the point where she can develop an affection for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The maiden's union with the Lord is already complete.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, she can freely express all of her feelings before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"What shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The little sister does not yet know what a life of love is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But when the eternal Lover leads her into a fellowship of love through the Holy Spirit, what will we do with her?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As far as her life is concerned, she is a little sister.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As far as her life of love is concerned, her two breasts have not developed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are concerned for this group of people and are burdened to care for them.</S>
