   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE DIVINE DISPENSING A DEVELOPING MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am grateful to the Lord that when I was young and seeking after biblical knowledge, He sovereignly brought me into touch with the Brethren teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That surely laid a good foundation for me.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1932 I began to give three or four messages a week.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first two or three years, my ministry of the Word was largely based on their teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before too long, however, my messages began to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From the base of the Brethren teachings, I improved to the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There was not too much difference, but at least I had a beginning of a change.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then I was helped by Brother Nee to see Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That was a real turn in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From 1934, at the latest, my ministry of the Word was focused on Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That ministry lasted eight or nine years and was much blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One result was the revival that came in 1943.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Due to that revival I was persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christianity joined with the invading army of Japan to persecute me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Japanese military police put me into prison for a month.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I became sick.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>During the two and a half years which followed, I was ill and suffered much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time I began to see the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That was a fresh beginning in my ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As soon as I was well enough, I began to speak on the tree of life, on the two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The light came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ministry in those years 1946 to 1948 served the Lord s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then in the spring of 1949 I was sent out from the mainland of China to the island of Taiwan, and I brought this light on the tree of life with me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After I got to Taiwan, I began to see another crucial point, that is, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, I knew the Spirit long before, but I didn t realize that the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Though I had stressed the importance of the experience of the Spirit, before 1950 I didn t see that the Spirit is the consummation, not just the third of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At first, however, I did not have the expression, the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This particular term came to me not too long ago.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in 1950 I realized this without having the full expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From that time in my ministry I had a great turn to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you check my writings in both Chinese and English, you will see that their focus in the past thirty-four years is actually the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By 1960 and 1961 my emphasis was altogether the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During that time I wrote over eighty hymns, most of which have been translated and are in our present hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A good number of them are on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of 1961 I came to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The ministry of the Word in this country began with this focus on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the early years in nearly every conference and training I stressed two things: the ground of the church and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I pointed out the Spirit from all the New Testament books.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then in 1969 at the conference in Erie, Pennsylvania, the light came concerning the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After that conference I went back to Los Angeles and we had a conference there, mainly on the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The light has kept coming concerning the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you trace from 1969 till now, within these fourteen years, you will see that the light has mostly been on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Quite a number of new terms have come in during this time: the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit, the compound Spirit, the processed Spirit, and the Spirit of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In 1953 and 1954 I began to see that the Spirit includes both divinity and Christ s humanity, including His living on earth, the effectiveness of His death, and the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I saw the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>My messages were a shock to the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How could I say that there were elements in the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was an altogether new thought to them.</S>
