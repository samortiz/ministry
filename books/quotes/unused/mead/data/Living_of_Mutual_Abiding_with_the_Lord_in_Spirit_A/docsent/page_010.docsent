   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAST ADAM BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus was God, the Word who was God from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Word became flesh to be the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was incarnated and had blood and flesh to be our redeeming Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If He had not been incarnated, being without blood and flesh, He could not die for us and even more He could not shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praise the Lord, He had flesh and blood so that He could die for us and shed real human blood to redeem us from sin!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise the Lord, this is what the last Adam accomplished for us!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then He rested, and people buried Him in a new tomb hewn in the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After God finished the work of creation, He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now again the Lord rested after accomplishing the work of redemption on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not long after His death on the cross, the Lord resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At the time He was raised from the dead, He was like a grain that had died in the earth and grown up in a different shape.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shape is a life shape, a life-giving shape.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First Corinthians 15, which is a chapter on resurrection, speaks of a grain being sown into the ground and growing into another shape.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then it speaks of the last Adam as such a grain resurrecting from the dead to become a tender sprout, which is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a grain is sown into the earth, it dies and then grows up to be a tender sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This tender sprout supplies life so that the wheat can become fully grown and bear fruit a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord said, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone, but if it dies, it bears much fruit John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are the much fruit, the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He became the life-giving Spirit to impart life into us as the many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we as the many grains are joined together, we become one bread, one Body, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, the issue of His death and resurrection as the one grain is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church is produced by Christ in His becoming the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This life-giving Spirit is signified by the tender sprout.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the tender sprout grows up, it begins to impart life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, many grains are brought forth to become the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you see this light, you will then realize that the theology taught in Christianity concerning the Trinity is very shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christian teachers speak about the Lord and the Holy Spirit as if the two were unrelated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, if you see the light in 1 Corinthians 15, you will realize that Christ and the Spirit are related and that They are two yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When Christ was the last Adam, He walked, stayed, and lived with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After passing through death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This life-giving Spirit is the Spirit in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before Christ s death and resurrection, the Spirit was not yet, as mentioned in John 7:39.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, after His death and resurrection, there was the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today, the fact that we can be regenerated and become the many grains to be the Body of Christ is a result of the dispensing of life by the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>FIRST IN THEN ABIDE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In John 14 the Lord Jesus told the disciples not to be troubled by His going; rather, they should rejoice because in not more than seventy-two hours, He would come again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when the Lord came back He was no longer that seed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When He came again, He had become the tender sprout, which is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When He came back, He entered into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At this time He was not only among them but was even in them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, whether the Lord could spread in them, whether He could abide and expand in them, depended on whether they were willing to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, in the next chapter He said, Abide in Me and I in you 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is by our abiding in the Lord that we give the Lord the opportunity to spread Himself within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we abide in the Lord, the Lord abides in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For example, if someone brings me to his house, when I go, I can only say that I am in his house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether I can remain there hinges totally on whether he welcomes me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you invite me over for a meal, it will take two and a half hours at the most to finish the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Afterward you can rightfully say, It is late; please go home to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether or not I stay depends on your attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, in John 14:23 the Lord said, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In John 14, it is first in and then abide.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 20 says, In that day that is, the day of the Lord s resurrection you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here the word is only in and not abide.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But in verse 23 there is the thought of abiding to make an abode.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today Christians often speak about the Lord being in them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They treasure His being in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, the Bible shows us that the Lord s being in them is the initial stage; first it is in and then abide.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First, He is in you, and then if you love Him, He will abide in you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord has come, and He is in you to be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if you do not love Him, how can He abide in you?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you love Him and keep His word, then His Father and He will come to you to abide with you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether or not the Lord abides with you depends upon your attitude and response.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You should have the response that you love Him and keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The One you love is the Lord Jesus, and the words that you obey are His words, but it is amazing that eventually the Father comes because of your love.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Are They the Father and the Son two or one?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord Jesus never said that He and the Father are two.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He said, I and the Father are one John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here it does not say that the Lord and the Father are united to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the Gospel of John we cannot see that the Lord and the Father are joined, united, to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, the Gospel of John shows us again and again that the Lord and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>John 14 shows us that first there is in, and then there is abide.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In chapter fifteen, the Lord Jesus explained this with an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He said, I am the vine; you are the branches v. 5 . With respect to the life within, the branches are abiding in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The branches abiding in the vine is the condition for the vine s abiding in the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It is not that the vine abides in the branches and then the branches can abide in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The vine s abiding in the branches is not the requirement for the branches abiding in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Rather, the branches abiding in the vine is the requirement for the vine s abiding in the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After His death and resurrection, the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, and in John 20 He came to breathe into the disciples, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit v. 22 . From that time on, the Lord was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today the Lord is truly in us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, whether the Lord can abide in us depends on our response.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do we love Him?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do we cooperate with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Is it what He says that counts, or what we say?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If what we say counts, then it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If what He says counts, then it is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we love Him and keep His word, His Father will come with Him not only to be in us but also to abide in us.</S>
