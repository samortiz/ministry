        <h2 class="head2">Our Destiny Being to Go Forth and Bear Fruit</h2>
<p>If we take a deeper look at John 15, we will see that fruit-bearing does not denote the virtues in the believers&rsquo; living, because in verse 16 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit.&rdquo; Some versions of the New Testament translate <em>go forth</em> as &ldquo;go,&rdquo; but according to the Greek text, the proper translation is &ldquo;go forth.&rdquo; <em>Go forth</em> implies a geographical distance. To bear the fruit of virtues in our living does not require us to go forth. We can stay at home and be meek. If everyone is trying to push forward, but I yield and withdraw, I am being humble and expressing more virtues. If it is merely a matter of bearing fruit, it can be explained as bearing the fruit of virtues in our living. However, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain.&rdquo; This refers to the need of the branches in the vine to bear grapes, that is, our need to lead people to be saved. Preaching the gospel is not merely to proclaim and explain the truth; rather, preaching the gospel is the issue of the outflow of life. Furthermore, we do not ask people to come to us; rather, we need to go forth, to approach them. Approaching people is for saving them; without our going forth to people, we cannot save them. This was why the Lord Jesus said that we need to go forth and bear fruit. Bearing fruit is a divine mandate, and it is our destiny because we are branches. Branches in the vine must bear fruit. In order to bear fruit, we must go forth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Going Forth to Preach the Gospel<br />
Being the Lord&rsquo;s Commission to Us</h2>
<p>In Mark 16:15 the Lord charged the disciples to &ldquo;go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation.&rdquo; This verse says to preach the gospel to all the creation, not only to all people. The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;The gospel should be proclaimed everywhere. Not only human beings need to hear the gospel; all creation needs to hear the gospel.&rdquo; This is how we should preach the gospel. Many years ago I used to say that we should preach the gospel every day and that if we cannot find a human being, we should preach to the cats and dogs. I was not confident when I said this, because I did not yet understand the Lord&rsquo;s word in Mark 16. However, I now have the confidence to say that if we can preach the gospel to cats and dogs, we can surely preach the gospel to human beings. If we cannot find any cats or dogs, we can preach the gospel to the furniture in our home. I have never preached the gospel to a pine tree, but I have often preached to the ocean. I learned to preach the gospel by speaking to the ocean, because in my early days of serving the Lord I had a hard time speaking in front of people. If we would preach the gospel to creation, we will surely have a desire to preach the gospel to people in order to lead them to be baptized so that they may be saved.</p>
<p>In Matthew 28:18-19 the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; The Lord has commissioned us to go forth; hence, we must obey. The Lord&rsquo;s word here indicates that we should go and disciple the nations with His authority. In order to disciple the nations, we need authority so that they can be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, that is, into the Triune God. We must accept this clear and solemn charge.</p>
<p>As branches of the vine, our destiny is to go forth and bear fruit. As far as the Lord is concerned, He has commissioned us to proclaim the gospel to the nations, to disciple them and to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. If we cannot find any human beings, we should proclaim the gospel to creation. Of course, if we were not Christians, if we were not saved, we would not be held accountable to the Lord for not preaching the gospel. However, since we are saved, we cannot resign from preaching the gospel. One day we will meet the Lord and give Him an explanation. On the one hand, preaching the gospel is something that we must do in our Christian life; we do not have any excuses. On the other hand, we love to preach the gospel because it gives us joy. I hope that after this fellowship we will not neglect preaching the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WAY</h2>
<p>The Bible reveals the Lord&rsquo;s way to preach the gospel. Christianity has been on the earth for two thousand years and has been brought to every country in the world. There are now numerous Christian groups and many different ways to preach the gospel. I was brought into Christianity when I was a young boy, and I saw many ways of gospel preaching. After I left mainland China and moved overseas, I heard that a certain Christian group would preach the gospel to people by playing a game of basketball for them. I will not criticize this, because it is a method of gospel preaching. However, the Bible is not silent concerning how we should preach the gospel. The Bible reveals that there is a definite way to preach the gospel, which was the Lord&rsquo;s practice. Since the Lord appointed and commanded us to preach the gospel, He must have a way. He does not require us to discover a way to preach the gospel. Regrettably, Christianity has changed numerous things in the Bible, including the way to preach the gospel.</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
