   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE TRESPASS OFFERING CHRIST FOR THE SINS OF GOD'S PEOPLE 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 5:1-10; 7:2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will begin to consider the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may think that, as the last of the five basic offerings, the trespass offering is not very important and rather easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Actually, the trespass offering is extremely important and is difficult to understand adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, in our study of Leviticus, we need to read 5:1-10 carefully and attentively.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In talking about sin, many people do not realize that there is a great difference between sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sin is a matter of indwelling sin as the nature of Satan within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sins are a matter of outward sinful deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sin offering deals with sin, and the trespass offering deals with sins, transgressions, and trespasses, including lies, mistakes, and all kinds of wrongdoing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Trespasses are transgressions, and transgressions are different kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE TRESPASS OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We first need to see the significance of the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. The Difference between the Sin Offering and the Trespass Offering</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is an important difference between the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The sin offering signifies Christ as our offering resolving sin in our fallen nature Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The trespass offering signifies Christ as our offering resolving the problem of sins in our conduct 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:5-6, 10-11 in ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 8:3 says, "God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has condemned sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How did He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did it by sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The phrase "likeness of the flesh of sin" combines sin and the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our flesh today is the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As we have pointed out, sin and the flesh are related to Satan, the world, and the prince of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whereas our flesh is the flesh of sin, Christ came only in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Him there was no sin; He did not have sin in His human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, in appearance He bore the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The flesh of fallen mankind is the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, the flesh of the fallen human race is one with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Where the flesh is, there is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word flesh signifies a fallen person, and every fallen person is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether we love others or hate them, we are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Genesis 6:3 says that fallen man became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since man has become flesh and the flesh is of sin, the flesh and sin are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As fallen human beings, we are flesh, and the flesh is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God condemned sin by sending His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was sin in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ was crucified in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that His flesh was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since His flesh was crucified, sin was condemned because sin and the flesh are identical.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God judged the flesh, and He judged sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He did this by judging Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God judged Jesus, He judged the flesh and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, at that time God destroyed Satan in the flesh, judged the world that was hanging on Satan, and condemned the prince of the world and the power struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One was crucified, but five things were dealt with: sin, the flesh, Satan, the world, and the power struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These five things are one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Second Corinthians 5:21 says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus did not know sin, but God made Him sin on the cross for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He was not only a sinful person in likeness, even as the brass serpent was a serpent in form John 3:14 , but He was also made sin by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If Jesus had not been made sin, sin could not have been judged when He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sin was condemned because Christ, while He was on the cross, was made sin on our behalf by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whereas the sin offering deals with the sin in our nature inwardly, the trespass offering deals with the sins in our conduct outwardly 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the marginal notes in the American Standard Version indicate, Isaiah 53:10 puts the trespass offering together with the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The same thing is true of chapter five of Leviticus.</S>
