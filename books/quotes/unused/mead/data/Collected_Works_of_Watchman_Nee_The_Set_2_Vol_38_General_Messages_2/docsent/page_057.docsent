   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brothers and sisters, do you feel that this subject does not interest you?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You have to realize that this is not just a matter of procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are some spiritual lessons to be learned here, and you can see the need of the breaking of the cross here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you want to live according to the principles mentioned above, you need the breaking of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a church does not take the dealing of the cross daily, God has no way to speak to this church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Elders, apostles, old, and young alike have to welcome the breaking of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only then can God speak clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The elders in particular must take the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every move and word of the elders affect the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They should not only read the condition of the brothers and sisters but also bring their affairs before the Father of light, pray over them again and again, and discuss them thoroughly before they make any decision.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a crucial principle, one that is against your concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among God's children, however, the elders are not the only ones who should keep this principle; God is inside the youngest brother and sister as well, and they can still affect revealing or obscuring God's will among His children.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, every brother and sister have to learn to be restricted by God in what they do and say.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have to learn to be broken by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If every brother and sister behave this way in a certain place, that place will become the place where God speaks the most.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one should despise another one in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A brother may have bothered you again and again, but even his opinion must not be despised.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you trample his opinion under your feet, one day you will be sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, this word comes from the mouth of those who have learned this lesson through much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You should not despise anyone, and you should not look down upon anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You have to bring even their complaints and attacks before the Lord and read them, and you must bear them upon your shoulder and inquire of God for them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You cannot be arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>David took others' rebukes to the Lord and read them before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brothers and sisters, do not presume that those who agree with you are the only ones who know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is often your opposers who make you understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If there is anything that can keep you from faltering in your footsteps, this principle is the only one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you do not want to offend God's heart or the brothers' and sisters' hearts, you have to live according to this principle in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only this principle will drive away your prejudice and your view, and only this principle will allow you to read the mind of the brothers and sisters before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The words you find will be the word that God intends to speak to His children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only this principle will allow God to unveil His heart to His children, and only this principle will satisfy the heart in heaven as well as the hearts on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose a few elders in the church decide on a matter and carry it out accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Another brother may not feel right about it, yet he dares not say anything rashly because of his fear of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the result of this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result is that the organic function of the Body of Christ is stifled through this decision.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then what is the right way?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before a matter is carried out, God must first operate among His children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the elders try to carry out a matter, they should first bring the condition of the brothers before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whatever comes out of such a reading will strike a sweet cord and a nod of approval in everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The elders should seek God's will according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Otherwise, a decision may end up being contrary to God's operation within His children, and the announcement of the decision will not bring about an echo within His children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's Spirit will not vindicate this matter within His children.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, the organic function of the Body of Christ will be obstructed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the elders would read the condition of God's children under His light and do this thoroughly before making any decision, the decision would produce an echo within His children; it would bring anointing to His children and motivate His children.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If they do not do this, the organic function of the Body of Christ will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brothers and sisters, we must ask God to deliver us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need not only the structure of the Body of Christ but also the organic operation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only then will the function of the Body be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This principle applies to every brother and sister; everyone has to realize this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>SIX</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is another thing I would like to point out the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is authority?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Superficially speaking, authority is based on position; whoever has position has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to the Bible, this also appears to be the case, but actually, this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Authority is not mainly a matter of position; it is primarily a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the people of Israel saw the budding rod of Aaron, they acknowledged his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without resurrection life, authority is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Authority in the church is not mainly a matter of position but a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You do not become an authority by others' election, and no one can claim authority based solely on his position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>David submitted to the authority of Saul because he feared God, but Saul was rejected by God because he rebelled against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He had only the position of a king, not the life of a king.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God did not vindicate his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This was not a case of David rebelling against the authority, but a case of God not vindicating it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God cast Saul down and set him aside.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The authority of the church is a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The amount of authority one has depends on the degree to which the resurrection life of God lives within him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The more he gives up God's resurrection life, the more gives up his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Bible says that the elders should not lord it over the flock but should be a pattern to the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>A pattern is an expression of life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is wrong to put on a sober expression and assert that one is an elder and that he has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If anyone among us demands submission in a pretentious way, others have to put a big question mark on his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the church all the brothers and sisters have to learn to humble themselves and submit to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Authority is a matter of living out the proper pattern in love.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only this will cause God's children to submit from their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May the Lord be merciful to us and give us some excellent patterns.</S>
