   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE HISTORY CONCERNING DAVID 3 PREPARED BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE A MAN ACCORDING TO THE HEART OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 SAMUEL 16 2 SAMUEL 1 3 PERSECUTED AND TRIED BY SAUL 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Sam 21 24</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we will continue to see how David was persecuted and tried by Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through all of Saul's persecution, David did not fight or do anything to avenge himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The only thing he did was flee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Saul was seeking to kill David, Jonathan and Michal helped him flee.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Through them God sovereignly provided David with certain kinds of information.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In everything related to David, God was sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From David's experience under Saul's persecution, we need to learn an important lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This lesson is that in the church life there should not be anything of the flesh; there should be no anger, no devices, no conspiracies, and no plots.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The church is the kingdom of God Rom 14:17 , and in the church there must be the divine authority with the proper order.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>No one should overthrow this order.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we will see, David feared God and did not dare to overthrow the order arranged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It would be a shame for us to say that we are in the Lord's recovery, yet we do not know that there is a God-ordained order.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rebellion and fighting annul the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With us there should be no rebellion, no anger, and no fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should just live Christ in the spirit that we may live a church life according to the divine, ordained order.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to learn the lesson of crucifying the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Avenging and fighting back are matters of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Ephesians 4:26 Paul said, "Do not let the sun go down on your indignation."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that when the sun sets our anger should also set.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No anger should linger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the revelation in the Bible, and we should practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the kingdom of God the flesh has to be ruled out.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Galatians 5:17 says that "the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 24 says that "they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 21 says that those who partake of the things of the flesh "will not inherit the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we are partakers with the flesh, we are through with the kingdom and will have no share in it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Things such as jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, and divisions are foreign articles in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the church life, therefore, there should not be any foreign articles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us now see what is recorded in 1 Samuel 21 through 24 concerning David's being persecuted and tried by Saul.</S>
