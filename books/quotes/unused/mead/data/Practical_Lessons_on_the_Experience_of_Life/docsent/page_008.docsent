   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WHAT WE RECEIVE BY REGENERATION The Triune God Dwelling in Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have been sprinkled, redeemed, forgiven, cleansed, separated, justified, and reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praise God, all the problems are gone!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now by being regenerated we have received God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First John 4:13 says, "In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is by regeneration that God comes into us to indwell us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By regeneration Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Corinthians 13:5 is the best verse to prove this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It says, "Test yourselves whether you are in the faith; prove yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Or do you not realize about yourselves that Jesus Christ is in you, unless you are disapproved?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as we have faith, regardless of how big or little it is, even if it is smaller than a mustard seed, we have Christ dwelling in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By regeneration the Holy Spirit also is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 8:9 and John 14:17 tell us this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 17 says, "Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that we have all three of the Triune God within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God the Father is in us, God the Son is in us, and God the Spirit is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That God is in us means that the greatest One in the entire universe is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First John 4:4 says, "Greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is the greatest One, Christ is the strongest, most powerful One Phil 4:13 , and the Holy Spirit is the most living One.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the Triune God is in us, we have the greatness, the strength and power, and the living energy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Triune God as the Eternal Life</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By regeneration we have received life, which is nothing less that the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not think that the divine life is something different from God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is God Himself in Christ through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First John 5:12 says, "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And John 3:15 says, "That every one who believes into Him may have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everlasting life, as in the King James Version, is an incorrect translation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everlasting refers to time, while eternal refers to something more than time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It also refers to the nature and sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Divine Nature with Its Taste</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In addition to the divine life, we have received the divine nature, the nature of God 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is hard to define the difference between life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have life, we have the ability to live; without life we have no ability to live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nature is more for the taste of a life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A cat has the taste to eat mice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the same way, a dog barks because barking is his nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need to teach a dog to bark; barking suits a dog's taste.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have the divine life; that is, we have the divine ability to live.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, we have the divine nature as our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no need for regulations against going to Las Vegas to gamble, because we Christians do not have this taste.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have the heavenly, divine nature, and with the divine nature there is the heavenly taste.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the nature of a pig, the dirtiest things are tasteful to it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A lamb, however, can fall into something dirty, but that is only an accident; it is not its practice.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the same way, we can fall into gambling, but this is not our practice because we have the divine nature within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only so, to go to the movies does not suit the divine nature in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is not such a taste within us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Life is mostly for ability and energy, while nature is mostly for taste.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have the strength, the ability, to live, and we have the divine nature with a holy, heavenly taste.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After sisters go to the department store and buy worldly items, they are not joyful because those things are not sweet to their taste.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is because they have the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Recently a friend asked me if I drink, smoke, or go to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I replied that I do not, he said that was too bad.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I said, "No, it is pitiful to you, but it is joyful to me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have different tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To drink, smoke, or go to the movies is a suffering to me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To you, however, it is an enjoyment because you have that kind of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have another nature, the heavenly, divine nature."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have not only the divine life, which is God Himself, but we also have the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is an enjoyment for us to have a holy, heavenly living, and it is an enjoyment to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is an enjoyment, not a regulation, because this is our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are feasting all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you do not believe this, try to go dancing, to the movies, or to gamble.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There will be a factor, the divine nature as your taste, which will constantly trouble you.</S>
