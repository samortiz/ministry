<h2 class="head2">Chuanchow, Shi-Shee,<br />Fukien Province</h2><p>We have just wired X dollars through the post office. When it arrives, please accept and count it. Please distribute it for us to all the brothers in the war zone. Did you receive our last letter, which requested five copies of each issue of The Open Door? Please send them to us.</p><p>Representing the meeting hall of Chuanchow, Shi-Shee,<br />Chai Gung-yuan<br />February 7</p><h2 class="head2">Ya-Dan-Ou,<br />Chekiang Province</h2><p>Greetings to my dear Brother Stephen in the Lord:</p><p>May the almighty God Himself keep you in peace until the Lord comes. I received your letter of November 5. The mail service was suspended for quite awhile, so it took almost one month for the letter to reach me. When the fighting approached San-Chiao-Bu, God still graced us by leading us to flee to Ya-Dan-Ou, a valley in the mountains not far from San-Chiao-Bu. We are completely surrounded by mountains, so this gives us a taste of the words of Psalm 121. I served the Lord for more than a month in Shao-Shing and then went home to take my family and flee. With regard to the work, we acknowledge that the Lord is the almighty One; man can do nothing. Mr. Sun's whole family also fled to Ya-Dan-Ou. I think that your letter was delayed because the post office service was frustrated by the war. Many of my letters (some were sent to you) have been lost or delayed. May this letter reach you without delay. The brothers and sisters in Nanking have all fled. Unfortunately, all my books are there. If the Lord does not want me to keep those things, I just praise and thank Him. If this is just the beginning of the tribulation and we cannot stand it, what will the great tribulation be like? May we both be able to keep the word of endurance, and may we keep watchful that we may be preserved from the coming tribulation. I hope you can come north, but may God's will be done. I have not written all I want to say. May the Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Tang Shou-ling<br />December 12, 1937</p><p>(This letter was written by Brother T'ang almost three months ago. We do not know where he is now. If anyone knows, please send an airmail letter telling us&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Wu-Yih, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>After receiving the first issue of The Open Door, we wanted to order several copies from you, but we were stopped for various reasons. I was able to borrow the second issue from Brother Wang Jin-tang and read it carefully. Then I found out that this publication contains news that is indispensable to the responsible brothers of a local church. Therefore, please send nineteen more copies of the second issue of The Open Door. Then send me twenty copies of each subsequent issue. I will tell you something of the condition of the church here. We have received perfecting from Brothers David Hsu, Chang Kwang-rong, Ma Chuan-foo, and Sister Miao Yun-chun over the past few years, and we have grown much. The Jesus Chapel in South Lion Lane of Wu-Yih now has the Lord's table, but there are not many people. There are already sixteen meeting places with believers in the Lord:</p><p>(1) Jesus Chapel, South Lion Lane, Wu-Yih. Responsible ones: Wang Jin-tang, Shao Tse-lin. (2) The church in Ho's house. Responsible ones: Ho Jang-yun, Ho Yin-dah, Ho Jun-lin. (3) The church in Wang-Shan-Tou. Responsible ones: Wang Sun-dah, Wang Shi-jin, Chu Sin-mu, Wang Zhang-hsi. (4) The church in Dong-Gao. Responsible ones: Hsu She-bao, Hsu Shui-hao, Chu Hwei-ai, Ho Du-ching. (5) The church in Shan-Fang. Responsible one: Wang Tien-shun. (6) The church in Kuo-Dong. Responsible ones: Ling Shun-mei, Ho Shang-pin. (7) The church in Tang-Li. Responsible one: Lin Bu-sha. (8) The church in Liang's house. Responsible ones: Fang Da-jiang, Chui Feng. (9) The church in Hsie-Keng. Responsible ones: Ding Keh-ming, Ding Keh-chang. (10) The church in Da-Ling Tsiao. Responsible one: Tsou Tu-wang. (11) The church in Ma-Ang. Responsible ones: Wang Jung-shing, Wu Da-tsing. (12) The church in Yao-Chu. Responsible ones: Hsie Shi-lin, Chang Chun-fa, Hsu Chi-mei, Wu Chou Hsiang-mei. (13) The church in Sin Village. Responsible ones: Yeh San-chun, Yeh Shi-chun. (14) The church in Hsu's house. Responsible ones: Dong Li-shing, Chang Teh-rong. There are also two meetings in Lu-Bi and Yu-Yuan, which are still in the stage of infancy, so I will not mention them this time. However, saved ones are there also. It is difficult to work in this region because most of the people are poor, suffering farmers. However, God is not a respecter of persons. I hope that there could be a meeting to train co-workers (plus elders and deacons) in this area. I have not received any special assignment from the Lord, so I am still waiting on Him. Please pray for us. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Ding Keh-chang<br />February 8<br />[Address omitted]</p><p>(Some of the names in this letter were not written clearly, so it was hard to avoid errors. We hope Mr. Ding will send another letter with the corrections. Among the names of the responsible ones, it seems that there are sisters; we assume that this refers to the deaconesses&mdash;Editor.)</p>
