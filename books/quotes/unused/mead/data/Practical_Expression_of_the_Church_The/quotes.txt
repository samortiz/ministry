[1]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee during the 1968 summer conference and training meetings in Los Angeles, California.
[2]  My burden in these messages is to share with you something regarding the practical expression of the church.
[3]  Regarding Christ we need living experience, and concerning the church we must have a practical expression.
[4]  Ephesians 3:10-11 unveils the fact that the existence of the church is according to the eternal purpose of God which He purposed in Christ.
[5]  In Ephesians 3:9-11, many great and significant terms are used because they are related to God's eternal plan.
[6]  This is why we all must respect the church and realize how much we need the church.
[7]  There are two important verses spoken by the Lord in the New Testament regarding the church.
[8]  16, 17 and 19 we see three things which are related to one another: Christ, the church, and the kingdom.
[9]  We have seen the purpose of God in chapter one, and we must now see the expression of Christ.
[10]  All of you are the fullness of the riches of America.
[11]  If you did not feed upon the riches of American food, you would all be greatly reduced.
[12]  If the brothers and sisters in any church do not know how to feed upon Christ, how to enjoy Christ and how to assimilate all that Christ is into their being, it is impossible to have a proper expression of the church in that locality.
[13]  If you do not know how to enjoy Christ, how to drink of Him, how to feed on Him, and how to take Him into your spirit and assimilate Him into your being, it is not possible for a proper local church to be produced in your locality.
[14]  Then we are told in 1 Corinthians 12:12 that the Body is Christ.
[15]  When we say that the local church is the house of God, we must realize that this house must be Christ.
[16]  As members of the Body, we do need the church life, and the church life is nothing but Christ Himself enjoyed by us and expressed in a corporate way.
[17]  We have seen that the expression of Christ is the church.
[18]  Many people talk about the church as the expression of Christ, but after a little consideration we will ask, "Where is the church?"
[19]  If we say that the church is the expression of Christ, then where is it?
[20]  When people speak about the church as the expression of Christ, it sounds nice, but we must put nice things into practice.
[21]  If we were to ask this practical question to so many teachers who teach concerning the church as the expression of Christ, we would put them into the corner.
[22]  Regarding the local churches, another three provinces of the ancient Roman Empire were mentioned in the New Testament: Asia, Galatia, and Macedonia.
[23]  And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church The church is another body, including the two or three : but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.
[24]  If I am in a certain city, regardless of how I feel about those who are meeting there as the unique local church and regardless of how they treat me, I have no choice.
[25]  I have no ground, no right, and no standing to start another church in that locality as long as a unique one is there already.
[26]  In the last chapter two points were covered: 1 the real need of the local churches to be the expression of the church; 2 two or three meeting together in the name of the Lord cannot be the church if there is already a church in that place.
[27]  Therefore, in this chapter we want to go on to see the practicality of the church.
[28]  I do not mean the reality of the church, but the practicality of the church.
[29]  If in any locality there is not a local church, regardless of how much we talk about the church, we do not have the practicality.
[30]  Matthew 16:18 is precious, but Matthew 18:17 is practical.
[31]  A local church may not be as spiritual as it should be, but it is practical to us.
[32]  The church in Los Angeles may not be as marvelous as that mentioned in Matthew 16:18, but we have it and we enjoy it!
[33]  If we do not have the local church today, practically speaking, we do not have the church.
[34]  There are four main aspects regarding the practicality of the church.
[35]  First of all, the practical building up of the church is in the local churches.
[36]  Suppose we do not have local churches, but we plan to build up the church in the heavens.
[37]  If we are not built with others in the local churches, we have never been built up in the church.
[38]  If we would have the Body life, the church life, in a practical way, we must be coordinated with one another.
[39]  For a proper and practical expression of the church, we need to know the oneness of the church.
[40]  If we can pass the test of oneness, then we are proper and right in our church practice.
[41]  Therefore, in order to have a proper and practical church life, we need to be very clear about the oneness of the church.
[42]  This oneness is also the unity of the faith, the oneness of that in which we all believe.
[43]  In order to keep the unity of the faith and not be carried away by the wind of doctrine, we need the growth in life.
[44]  If we remain in childhood, we may be easily carried away by the wind of some doctrine.
[45]  Since we have seen that the local church is the practical expression of the church, we should not insist on anything but the faith.
[46]  First of all, we should not insist on anything but the faith.
[47]  If you would not take this way of the local church, but do as we do, you would be much in demand.
[48]  CHAPTER SIX THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; 1 Corinthians 1:10-13; 11:19; Galatians 5:20 The word "heresies" in these verses means sects, or schools of opinions ; Titus 3:10
[49]  In the past chapters we have seen the eternal purpose of God, the expression of Christ, the expression of the church, the practicality of the church, and the oneness of the church.
[50]  After the oneness, we must see the ground of the church.
[51]  First of all, we must see the meaning of the term, "the ground of the church."
[52]  Now let me ask, What is the ground of the church?
[53]  In principle we have seen the meaning of the ground and its importance, but we must apply it.
[54]  There is a church built upon the Presbyterian ground, a church built upon the Baptist ground, a church built upon the Methodist ground, and so many kinds of "churches" built upon so many kinds of grounds.
[55]  I believe we can see all the different grounds of divisions.
[56]  This is why we must give up all of these things.
[57]  When we go to a place, as long as the church there is on the proper ground, we must be one with her.
[58]  Whether she sprinkles or not, whether she practices speaking in tongues or not, whether she has head-covering or not, we still must go along with her, because she is the church on the proper ground.
[59]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE GENERAL ATTITUDE FOR UNITY Scripture reading: Romans 14:1-6; 15:7 TODAY'S PROBLEM
[60]  The problems most prevailing today in Christianity are mostly due to our different opinions regarding certain things, and these different opinions are due to a shortage of Christ.
[61]  We all have our own tastes and our own concepts in so many matters; but if we are in our opinions and our concepts, we only cause trouble.
[62]  We should not insist on anything, but keep the unity for the church life in spite of all dissenting matters.
[63]  It is only possible by caring only for Christ and the church!
[64]  We must be filled with Christ and strong in our spirit for the church life.
[65]  Suppose I am a brother who loves to practice a certain thing which to me is very scriptural, and when I come to a certain local church, I find that the church opposes that very thing.
[66]  But if I do this, it proves that I do not know Christ so well as life and that I am not strong in the spirit for the church life.
[67]  If I am full of Christ and strong for the church, I will not care what they do or what kind of doctrine they have; I will only praise the Lord that here is a local church on the proper ground where I can minister Christ.
[68]  The proper way to have the church life is simply to have Christ as the foundation upon the proper ground of unity.
[69]  We must not care for anything but Christ and His church on the proper ground of unity.
[70]  If we are strong in the spirit and full of Christ, it will be easy for us to go on with the local church, caring not for other things.
[71]  As long as the church in our city is on the proper ground of unity, we will be one with it and minister Christ in it.
[72]  It is only by being so liberal and general that we can receive all the saints in the proper way.
[73]  If we are otherwise, we cannot avoid being sectarian in the matter of receiving.
[74]  If we are special in anything and insist upon that, we will probably not receive those who differ from us in certain matters.
[75]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE GROUND OF LOCALITY Scripture reading: Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5; Revelation 1:11 THE CHURCH EQUAL TO THE CITY
[76]  Acts 14:23 says that elders are ordained in every church, but Titus 1:5 says that elders are ordained in every city.
[77]  This means that "in every city" is "in every church," and "in every church" is equivalent to "in every city."
[78]  Then Revelation 1:11 says: "What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches: unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea" A.S.V. . Have you noticed all the unto's in this verse? The Lord tells John to write a book and send it unto the seven churches.
[79]  When something was written and sent to the church in Ephesus, it means that it was sent to the city of Ephesus, because the church in Ephesus represented that city in the eyes of the Lord.
[80]  Beginning in 1922, many local gatherings were raised up by the Lord in China.
[81]  By 1933, Brother Watchman Nee, realizing the confusion among the Brethren assemblies and being greatly concerned regarding the boundary or limit of a local church, read through the New Testament again in order to be clear concerning this matter.
[82]  From 1934 Brother Nee became more and more clear, not only concerning the boundary of the local church, but also concerning the ground of the local church.
[83]  From the boundary of the local church, Brother Nee went on to see the ground of the local church.
[84]  Not only is the city limit the boundary of the local church, but the city itself is the ground of the church.
[85]  Another problem regarding divisions concerns those who only care for spirituality.
[86]  It may be that they are not clear that the ground of the church does not depend upon the condition of the church.
[87]  CHAPTER NINE THE UNIQUE GROUND OF UNITY Scripture reading: Deuteronomy 12:5-6, 8, 13-14, 17-18, 26; 14:22-23; 15:20; 16:2, 5-6, 15-16; 2 Chronicles 3:1; Psalm 133:1-3
[88]  The things of the New Testament always have their types in the Old Testament.
[89]  With the individual way of enjoying Christ there is no problem, but with the corporate way there is a real problem.
[90]  When we say that this is wrong and that we all must be one, others say that we are narrow and exclusive.
[91]  The only thing in which you may say that the church on the proper ground is narrow is that it will not take anything divisive.
[92]  We are working to build up the local church, but you have been sent by your mission to come here to build up the church of your mission.
[93]  In order that we may be definitely clear concerning the local church i.e., one church in one city , we must see the matter of the church in the home.
[94]  Today, Christians have too much liberty regarding the church.
[95]  This is because they do not have the vision concerning the local church.
[96]  If we have the vision of the local church on the right ground, we will all be restricted.
[97]  It all depends upon one thing: that is, how much we have really seen the local church on the right ground.
[98]  Whenever we come to this point regarding the ground of the church, there is always a sense that we are fighting against something.
[99]  If we are only willing to be shown the local church on the right ground, the way will be opened for the Lord's mercy and grace to flood in. Regardless of how weak you are, if you are really willing to see this, the Lord will come in to bless.
[100]  Do not try to reconcile the denominations with the local church.
[101]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE BLESSING ON THE GROUND OF UNITY Scripture reading: 1 Corinthians 1:10-13; 11:19; Titus 3:10; Psalm 133:1-3; Ephesians 4:3
[102]  In Psalm 133, there are four main items: the unity, the ointment, the dew, and the blessing of life.
[103]  They say that it is impossible to keep the unity; so we must not talk about it; it is enough to talk about the Lord Jesus and help others to know Him.
[104]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: 2 Timothy 2:19-21
[105]  After seeing something of the church ground, we must go on to see the fellowship of the church.
[106]  Why must you look down on those who speak in tongues?
[107]  The fellowship of the Body and of the church is based upon one thing: that is, we all are redeemed by the same blood and regenerated by the same divine life.
[108]  Some brothers who have seen the ground of the local church feel that if they take this ground they will be cut off from the fellowship of other groups of Christians.
[109]  Not too long ago, a brother asked me this question: "How can we take the ground of the local church, yet still be identified with all the people of the Lord?"
[110]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN PRACTICAL LESSONS FOR THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture reading: 1 Timothy 3:15 WHAT TO DO WITH DENOMINATIONS
[111]  In the last chapter we have seen something regarding the attitude we must have toward the saints who are still in the denominations.
[112]  On one hand, we must be so general and so open to all saints regardless of their background.
[113]  Now we must see some of the practical lessons of the church life that we may know how to behave in the local church.
[114]  When we leave the denominations and come to the ground of unity, we must learn immediately that we are not for any doctrine, form, or practice.
[115]  Another thing we must learn to abandon is the ambition for position.
[116]  In the church life, there is the temptation of wanting to take the lead.
[117]  And if the church does not put you into a position, you say that you do not care, but you really do.
[118]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: "But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
[119]  Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led a train of vanquished foes and gave gifts unto men.
[120]  And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the body of Christ, until we all arrive at the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, at a full grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive; but holding the reality in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ: out from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by every joint of supply, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh growth of the body unto the building up of itself in love."
[121]  As we have mentioned previously, unity is first, life is second, and fellowship is third.
[122]  We all need to be defeated, captured and gained by Christ.
[123]  If we have been captured by Christ, He has the ground to give us the gifts; but if we still have not surrendered to Him to be captured by Him, He has no ground to give us the gifts.
[124]  Perhaps the Lord's intention is to establish you as a teacher in the church, but to this very day He cannot do it because you will not give Him the position.
[125]  Do not think that the elders in the church must be persons with certain natural qualifications and capabilities.
[126]  No, that is not what the church needs; that is what worldly organizations need.
[127]  In Ephesians 4:16, the phrase "from whom" in Greek means "out of whom."
[128]  The supply comes out of Christ, into whom we have grown as our Head.
[129]  If we are going to have a proper church life, we must give up the clergy-laity system, give up ourselves to let Christ take over, and give up the concept that we come to the meetings to receive help from those who are gifted.
[130]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN FUNCTION BY PUTTING OFF THE OLD Scripture reading: Ephesians 4:13-16, 22-24; Colossians 2:6-7; 3:10-11
[131]  We have pointed out that if we are going to have the proper function in the local church, we need first of all to be captured by Christ.
[132]  The more we grow in Him, the more we will receive of Him our function in the church.
[133]  If we are devoid and short of Christ, we may have many activities, but we do not have any function in life.
[134]  After we have been captured by Christ and are willing to grow in Him, we must learn how to put off all that we are and follow Christ within our spirit.
[135]  Then we will become a functioning member in the Body, not just an active one.
[136]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN FUNCTION BY THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT Scripture reading: 2 Corinthians 3:6, 17; Romans 1:9; 8:4-5; 12:11; 1 Corinthians 5:3-4
[137]  The real function in the church is the release of the spirit.
[138]  The functioning in the local church depends entirely upon the release of the spirit.
[139]  If we do not render any coordination to the Lord, the Lord cannot do anything, for in the New Testament dispensation there is the principle of incarnation.
[140]  Brother Watchman Nee has written a book entitled The Release of the Spirit.
[141]  One of the main principles in functioning is that we must never forget to apply the blood of Christ.
[142]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN FUNCTION BY PRAY-READING Scripture reading: Deuteronomy 27:14-26; Revelation 5:9-14; 19:1-6; 1 Corinthians 14:16
[143]  In the last chapter, we mentioned the release of the spirit.
[144]  Without the release of the spirit, there is no real function of life in the church.
[145]  We may have certain functions of teachings, doctrines, and knowledge, but we cannot have any function of life if there is no release of the spirit.
[146]  We love to say the four words "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!"
[147]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: 1 Peter 5:1-6; Hebrews 13:17, 24; Romans 12:8, 1 Corinthians 12:28
[148]  In this chapter, we must look into another aspect of the local church, that is, the government of the church.
[149]  The brothers who are in the government of the church must realize that they are not to exercise their authority but to take up their responsibility.
[150]  If we read through the New Testament carefully, we see clearly that in the local church there must be a government with elders appointed by the apostles Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5 .
[151]  In many places among the brothers and sisters, hardly one is equipped both with standing and ability.
[152]  Some have the standing without the ability, and others have the ability without the standing.
[153]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE CONTENT OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: Matthew 13:3; 1 Corinthians 3:6-7; 1 Peter 1:23; 2:2, 5; Ephesians 2:21; 4:15-16
[154]  Christ is the content of the church, but we must realize that this Christ who is the content of the church is life to us.
[155]  As such, He would only be the ruler of the church, not the content of the church.
[156]  Finally, they will ask him to correct and change his attitude "Brother, you know that in the church we must have a life of love.
[157]  How did the Lord Jesus begin the church life?
[158]  Some people have the concept that Christ began the church life with teaching.
[159]  The Lord Jesus began the church life by sowing Himself into man as the seed of life.
[160]  If we want a solid church life with a group of believers built up in a solid way, we must minister Christ as life so that everyone will grow.
[161]  I do not expect to see any change in the brothers, but I do expect to see growth.
[162]  CHAPTER TWENTY BUILDING IN LOVE Scripture reading: Ephesians 4:16; 1 Corinthians 8:1; 1 Corinthians 13
[163]  In this chapter, we must see that love is the practical living of the church.
[164]  The word "living" can also mean "expression"; the expression of a local church is love.
[165]  I do not believe that the Lord will use the gifts very much in His recovery.
[166]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE INCREASE AND SPREAD OF THE CHURCH Scripture reading: John 15:4-5, 7-8; Philippians 1:27; Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8; 8:1 THE CHURCHES' INCREASE
[167]  In this chapter we must see the increase of the church.
[168]  The increase of the church is to impart Christ to others and make them a part of Christ.
[169]  Here in Los Angeles, the church does not have any kind of Gospel campaign, yet every month there are a good number of new converts that come into the church life.
[170]  The church should encourage every member to pray for the bringing in of new converts to the church.
[171]  Locally, it is the increase; universally, it is the spread.
[172]  The church needs the increase locally, and the spread universally.
[173]  If the church in Los Angeles has been existing locally for ten years without any increase, and there is still only one church in this country without any spreading, we are wrong.
[174]  CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO PREPARATION FOR THE LORD'S RETURN Scripture reading: Luke 21:24-28; 1 Thessalonians 5:1-10 THE LORD'S MOVE IN CHINA
[175]  From 1920 in China, especially among the young people, the Lord began to do a marvelous work.
[176]  Soon after that, the Lord began a real move for Himself and His church in China.
[177]  We saw that Christ not only died on the cross for our sins, but also to put us to an end. Christ died that we might be brought to an end and that He could be life to us; then we could live by His resurrection life.
[178]  If we read the entire New Testament, we will realize that there must be a group of people on this earth who have been regenerated, transformed, built up together, and prepared as His Bride for Him to come back as the Bridegroom.
