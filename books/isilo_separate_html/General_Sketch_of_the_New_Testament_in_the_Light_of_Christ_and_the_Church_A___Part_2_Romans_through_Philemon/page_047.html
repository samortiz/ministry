A person&#8217;s body is his dwelling place. Strictly speaking, we do not live in a house; we live in our body. This is why the Scriptures liken our physical body to a dwelling place. In 2 Corinthians 5:1 Paul calls our fallen body an earthly tabernacle dwelling, a temporary dwelling, in contrast to a dwelling not made with hands, which will be our resurrected body in the future. Just as our body is the place in which we exist, our habitation, so the church is the Body of Christ to contain Christ and to express Him. Hence, it is the dwelling place, the habitation, of the Triune God.<p>As we have seen, the church as the new man is a matter of life, the church as the Body of Christ is a matter of expression, and the church as the bride of Christ is a counterpart. To speak of the church as the dwelling place of God, however, conveys the central thought of building. We need to be built up; this thought is very much revealed in Ephesians, as in 2:20-22 and 4:12 and 16. The church is the temple of God because it is God&#8217;s habitation, God&#8217;s dwelling place.<h2 class=head1>OUR NEED FOR EXPERIENCE</h2><p>God dwells in the temple, but more specifically He dwells in the inner chamber of the temple. His Shekinah presence is in the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies is a type of our human spirit. Man is a temple of three parts, and our spirit is the innermost part. If we know how to discern and exercise our spirit, we can realize God&#8217;s presence, which is His indwelling in the church. If we do not know how to use our spirit, to say that God is in the church is mere doctrine. We must learn how to discern and exercise our spirit in order to experience God&#8217;s presence more and more in our spirit and in the church. We do not need doctrines but the conscious exercise of our spirit.<p>In Ephesians there are two prayers. The first prayer is a prayer for revelation (1:15-23), while the second prayer is a prayer for experience (3:14-19). At the beginning of this book we need a prayer for us to have revelation. Then, after we receive revelation, we need another prayer for us to experience what we see. Paul&#8217;s first prayer is for us to have a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Christ, while his second prayer is that our inner man would be strengthened with power that we may experience Christ in a full way, that Christ may make His home in us, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God. This is the real experience of God being present in the church, particularly in our inner man.<p>Verse 16 says that we are strengthened not in the inner man but into the inner man. This means that the Holy Spirit deals with our inner man by working more and more of Christ into it. This requires us to practically discern, know, and exercise our spirit. However, the matter of our spirit is overlooked and even opposed by many Christians today. When we minister to people about Christ in our spirit, many of them are surprised; they have never heard this. Although they may receive much help from Christian workers to know the Word, memorize the Word, and understand the Word, they may never have been told how to exercise their spirit to experience Christ as the Spirit. To exercise our spirit is a very vital matter.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_046.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_048.html">Next</a> </body></html>
