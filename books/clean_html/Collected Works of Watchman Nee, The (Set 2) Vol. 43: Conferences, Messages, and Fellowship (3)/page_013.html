<h2 class="head2">God Loving the World</h2><p>Second, God loves the world, that is, God loves man. Today many do not believe that God loves them and will save them freely. They think that they must go through many sufferings before they can be saved. Martin Luther was like this before he was enlightened. He knelt on the stairs of the cathedral, fasted, prayed, and afflicted his own body. He thought that this might cause God to forgive him of his sins. This is the concept and practice of many Catholics. They think that they must beg and implore before God will change His heart and mind to forgive them. This is man's biggest misunderstanding. The Bible says that there is no need for us to beg God to change His mind. His love is not affected by what we have done; He loves the world to the uttermost. God's nature is love; love is even God Himself. God's feeling toward man is just love. The biggest misunderstanding man has toward God is to think that God hates man or that He wants to punish man.</p><p>One time I came across 1 John 4:16 and John 3:16 and became almost ecstatic with joy. I put down the Bible in the house and ran out to the streets of Shanghai. I said to the first person I saw, "Do you know that God loves you?" Then I said the same thing to the second person I saw.</p><p>I know of a young man in America whose parents were very poor. The family's whole livelihood depended on the little work that the aging father did. One day the young man said to his father, "I am going to leave home." His father asked, "Why are you leaving home?" He said, "Because this family is too poor; there is not enough money for food and clothing." When the father heard this, tears came down his face. The next morning the father got up and prepared some food for the son. Handing a parcel to the son, he asked when the son would be leaving. The son said that he was leaving that very day. The father put the package in the son's hand and accompanied him for a little while. They walked on the village road without saying a word. When the son was about to bid farewell, the father said, "In my whole life, I have never wanted to be rich. But last night I hated myself for not being rich. It is because we are poor that you are leaving. I feel very sad. I am giving you all that I can give you. I have put the best items in here." They continued walking together for another two or three miles. Finally, the father gave a silver coin to his son, saying, "Perhaps you will need some money. For the last four or five years, you have not seen any silver coins, only copper coins. Here is a silver coin today; it is passed on to you from your mother. Good-by, my son. May God bless you." At this point the young man saw something. He realized how much his father loved him. Even though his family was very poor, he felt that he had no choice but to accept the parcel. Then he left his father and went to a big city. He worked as a chief editor for a newspaper and earned a great deal of money. Soon he forgot his poor family. Later, the newspaper business closed, his money ran out, and he became sick. One day he took the parcel that his father had given him and went to an inn. As he was lying in the inn, he began to realize that his condition was worse than when he was at home. He did not know whether he could return home. He thought, "I cannot go home, because I did not treat my father well. Perhaps my father hates me. I did not send any money home when I was making all the money in the city. I did not correspond with anyone in the family. I wonder if I still have my father's love."</p><p>Later, he became so sick that he thought he should go home to see his father before his death. He gathered his luggage and returned home. When he got to the house, he did not go in immediately. He took a peek from the outside of the house and saw his father, who had aged even more. The furniture inside the house was as old and worn as it was before. He saw his aging father eating alone and looking very devastated. Then his father picked up his Bible and began to pray, saying, "May You be gracious to save and bless my son. May he not suffer because of the poverty at home. May he find happiness and no longer suffer so much hardship." When the son heard his father's prayer from the outside, he knew his father still loved him very much. He opened the door and entered the house, weeping and saying to his father, "From now on, even if I become the richest person in the whole world, I am not going to leave."</p><p>This is a picture of man today. He thinks that God does not love him. We have to realize that it is we who fail to love God rather than God who fails to love us. We are the ones who reject God; God has never rejected us. The Lord said to Jerusalem, "How often I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!" (Matt. 23:37). The Lord is willing, but we are not willing. God never fails to love us; it is we who fail to love God. Human beings have no love; it is impossible for us to love God. However, God is love; it is impossible for God not to love. As far as God's love is concerned, the second greatest revelation in the Bible is that God loves man. God's feeling toward man is forever love.</p>
