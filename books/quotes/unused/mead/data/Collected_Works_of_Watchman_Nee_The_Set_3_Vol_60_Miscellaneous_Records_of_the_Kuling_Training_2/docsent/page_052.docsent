   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FOUR A TALK WITH THE CO-WORKERS Date:October 1948</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place:Brother Nee's home, Foochow OUR ATTITUDE TOWARD GOD'S CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Shanghai Concession the area ceded to foreign powers and in Hong Kong a British colony , a foreign man can be deported for committing certain crimes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a Chinese commits the same crime on Chinese soil, he cannot be treated the same way because he is standing on different ground.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No matter where he is sent, he will still be on Chinese soil.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A preacher once spoke sternly, "Look at your co-workers!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What kind of persons they are!"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our attitude should take God's attitude as its standard.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We cannot reject what God accepts, and we cannot accept what God rejects.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may have sloppy and underqualified brothers, but we must ask, "Is he a brother?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he is, we cannot "deport" him, unless he has committed excommunicable sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can excommunicate a student from a school, but we cannot excommunicate and reject a brother from a family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If anyone thinks that he can choose between brothers, I can exercise a choice as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But a brother is a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot cut off our relationship with him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The basic principle of the church is recovery, not excommunication.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When I was at White Teeth Lake, I once argued with Miss Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She said she wanted to gather a group of overcomers together.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I said, "This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do, you are making yourself a sect."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We believe in the truth concerning the overcomers, but we cannot choose a group of overcomers to form an overcomers' group.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I knew about a certain situation concerning a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A few years later, others knew about it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they found this out, they asked why I tolerated him for such a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I thought in my heart, "A sect can choose whom it likes, but we cannot exercise such a choice among God's children; we cannot choose whom we like in the church."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, when a man chooses to leave of his own accord, that is a different story.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>HOW TO TREAT THE CO-WORKERS Leading the Co-workers, Not Choosing Them</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same principle applies to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All of God's servants are our co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our pathway is not one of exercising our choice but one of bringing the brothers and sisters to a proper condition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All workers, and indeed all leaders, should not choose only brothers and sisters whom they think are useful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A worker is produced through leading, not through choice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church in Corinth, Cephas, Apollos, and Paul did not exercise preference or choice over any brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yet some among them wanted to create a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They declared their allegiance to certain ones.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What would have happened if Cephas or Apollos or Paul exercised their preference as well?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In leading others, it is not enough for us to know and judge others' condition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our heart must be broad, and we must be broad.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One of Hudson Taylor's virtues was that he was genuinely interested in every worker.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A worker must spend all his energy and pay the greatest price to help the useless ones to become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A good foreman is one who is able to lead others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus dispensed what He had to the twelve disciples, and at least eleven of them were gained.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As you set out for your work and as you work with other co-workers, you may feel that this or that one is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You may write to me to ask for a change of partners, but I do not have that many alternatives for you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One brother said that many of the co-workers on the mountain are actually not qualified to be servants of God, but I can only respond, "I use what the Lord uses.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our responsibility is to lead others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We can only use what God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot use what God has not given us."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have said previously that we should bear in mind whether or not others are above us, and we should readily yield to them when we set out in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is especially true of those who are the leaders of a region.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Sister Pearl Wang later told me that it was useless to say such a word because in reality there are no such advanced ones in all the regions.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God only uses men who are already available.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not sit and wait for the unmanifested "qualified ones" to appear.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord used Judas until the night before His crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Before that night no one knew that he was going to betray the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not use our judgments of men as material for gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Our judgments are merely for the purpose of carrying out our authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not an easy thing to be a foreman in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church is here to build, not to tear down.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must not lose sight that we are here to edify others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should be clear about everything that is going on in the church, but we should not be that clear about the condition of our co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I believe that everyone can be edified.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we do not believe this, there is something wrong with us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Everyone loves and cherishes his own body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There should be the same concern for the spiritual Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Doing Our Best to Lead and to Perfect</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to be clear in our principle and in our direction.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we realize that the Lord has used a person, even if only once, we have to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a person has rendered the Lord some service, even if only once, we have to lead him on.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>One of our greatest temptations is to reject men.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not look at the twelve disciples and say, "They are all like Judas!"</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Our leadership and guidance in the positive direction must be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is a hard work, and it demands a high price.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>May I say a word "beside myself" again: If I am given a choice to reject, I am afraid many of the ones I know would have been rejected long ago already!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The practice of rejection is contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In leading others we must never say, "I have exhausted my patience!"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We must have longsuffering.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If our patience is unlimited, our edification and recovery will also be unlimited, and the church will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Every mother has her heart pierced by knives repeatedly.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Every time her heart is pierced, her heart becomes broadened and expanded.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In perfecting others, we should be like mothers cherishing their children.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Consider the doctors in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>They receive casualties from the police and the Red Cross every day, casualties from traffic accidents.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If they consider the condition of the patients to be serious, they amputate immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But if a relative or family member pleads for treatment, the doctors spend three or four times the effort to stitch the dismembered parts back to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Let me ask, "Is the church in the business of stitching dismembered ones back in or in the business of amputation?"</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The first choice is to recover the severed members.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Amputating a member is always the last choice.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>As much as possible, we should lead, help, and edify others.</S>
