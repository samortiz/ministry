   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUBJECTIVE PROBLEMS IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regrettably, there are very few normal Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is as if we are all bad actors in a two-man comic show, who cannot act in unison and who are not professional.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s life may move in us, but we do not move according to Him; we are not one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not cooperate with Him and obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, God s life encounters obstacles in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These problems can be divided into three categories, but there may also be a fourth category that needs some final consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our spirit is the deepest part of our being, and God s life is in His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Spirit comes into us, He comes into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The spirit in us can be compared to a filament in a light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The filament is the innermost part of a lamp, and it allows the electrical current to flow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When electricity flows into a light bulb, it flows into the filament of the light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If there is no filament in a light bulb, electricity cannot flow into it and the bulb cannot shine forth any light.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The filament can be compared to the spirit in us with the Holy Spirit coming into our spirit with God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our mingled spirit can also be compared to the hidden actor in a two-man comic show: The Spirit, hidden in our spirit, prompts us with orders and feelings in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our innermost part is our spirit, but surrounding our spirit is our person, our self, which is also the soul spoken of in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our soul surrounds our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The three parts of our soul are the mind, which is the organ through which we think; the will, which is the organ through which we choose and make decisions; and the emotion, which is the organ through which we express feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The mind, emotion, and will equal our self, which is also our person, our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, which is in the deepest part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Surrounding our spirit is our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, in order to be consistent within and without, our mind, emotion, and will in our soul must cooperate with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The mind, emotion, and will equal our person, which is the outer man spoken of in the Bible; the Holy Spirit in our spirit is the inner man 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our soul can be compared to the actor at the front of the stage, and our spirit can be compared to the person hiding at the back of the stage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is one person inside and another person outside.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A proper Christian is one whose mind, emotion, and will cooperate with his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>An abnormal Christian is one whose mind, emotion, and will cannot cooperate and even contradict his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, he lives under a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our mind, emotion, and will cannot adequately cooperate with our spirit, we will have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Problem of Our Mind</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A certain brother may be very zealous after he is saved, and he may have the concept that he should preach the gospel for the Lord and save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This concept comes from his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He thinks that once he becomes a Christian, he should be zealous for the Lord and preach the gospel because this is what a proper Christian is supposed to do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, he does not realize that this is only a natural opinion, which comes from his mind and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus lives in his spirit, and when he prays in the morning, the Lord may give him a feeling to apologize to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This feeling does not come from his mind and thoughts; instead, it comes from his spirit, which is where the Lord s Spirit dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a thought is unrelated to his natural mind or natural thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has absolutely no concept of apologizing to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While he desires to zealously preach the gospel for the Lord, the Spirit of the Lord is moving in his spirit and urging him to apologize to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This shows that the thought in his mind of going to preach the gospel is different from the feeling in his spirit that he should apologize to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The thought in his mind and the feeling in his spirit do not match.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Inwardly, there is a sense that he should apologize, but outwardly, his thoughts are focused only on preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The two are not one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a problem because his thoughts do not match the sense in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His only consideration is to preach the gospel zealously; he has no thought to apologize to his wife, even though he has a sense in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are thousands of stories like this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows the problem of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The year after China won the Sino-Japanese War, I went to Nanking and met a brother whom I had known for ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was prominent in the textile industry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One day, he invited us to eat with him, and he purposely sat beside me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He said, Brother Lee, I genuinely feel that I should do more things; that is, I should do more things for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I heard this, I did not agree with him, and I did not feel very comfortable within.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I looked at him, and he continued to tell me that he wanted to care for orphans and that he wanted to do this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He spoke of many things, and the more he spoke, the more excited he became.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the end of our time, he asked, Brother Lee, what do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I could not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I could only think inwardly, Do these things come from the moving of Christ within?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I was very disappointed that day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This brother had been saved for a long time, and he had passed through many things, but it seemed as if he had not learned any lessons or made any advance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I actually wanted to ask him, Is this something that the Lord wants you to do, or does it come from your own thoughts and opinions?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I also wanted to ask, Brother, have you dealt with the matter of consecration over these past few years?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Have you dealt with sin thoroughly?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Has the Lord gained the ground in you?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the things you want to do originate from your thoughts, then they will be nothing more than religious activities even if they are successful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They will not help people see and gain Christ, because they are merely religious activities that originate from your thoughts; they are not a testimony of Christ being lived out from your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit dwells in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When the Spirit comes out of us, it is life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Nevertheless, we are often like an unwilling participant in a two-man comic show with God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the Spirit moves in us, we ignore, suppress, and put Him aside; instead, we exercise our mind to think and our eyes to watch.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We use our mind to think about what others would do, and we use our eyes to watch what others are doing rather than following the living Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Consequently, even if we accomplish some religious enterprise, we are not living out Christ s life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His life will be blocked and unable to get through in us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Although we have the life of Christ within, we do not cooperate with Christ s life in our thoughts and in our actions, and so this life cannot be lived out from us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the problem of our mind.</S>
