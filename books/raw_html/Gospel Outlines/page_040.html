<h1 class="title">THE BLESSEDNESS OF HAVING SINS FORGIVEN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Psa. 32:1-7</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man has sinned
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Make it clear, in principle, that every man has sinned, and every man has offended God.</li>
	<li>We may pick up four of five items of practical sins in detail, such as stealing, lying, covetousness, lust, etc., to describe the situation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The necessity of confession
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man must confess that he has sinned in the eyes of God.</li>
	<li>We must pray and confess our sin before God. Quote verses 3 and 5 of Psalm 32.</li>
	<li>We should follow the inner feelings when we confess our sins, confessing them item by item.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The promise of forgiveness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Forgiveness of sins is based upon the death of the Lord Jesus and the shedding of His blood. The reason God can forgive man&rsquo;s sins is that the Lord Jesus has died and has shed His blood for man and has eliminated man&rsquo;s sins.</li>
	<li>The promise of forgiveness of sin is given in the Bible. After God resolved our sins through the Lord Jesus, He clearly told us through the Bible to believe, and we shall receive the forgiveness of sins. This promise is the gospel.</li>
	<li>Only believe the word of the Bible, and you will obtain the promise of the forgiveness of sins. Once you believe, you receive the pardon; you will have no condemnation but rather, justification.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The blessedness of having sins forgiven
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When God forgives men&rsquo;s sins, He not only covers and pardons our sins, but He also blots them out, just as though man had never sinned. That is why Psalm 32 says, &ldquo;Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity.&rdquo; In God&rsquo;s eyes, all that have been forgiven by Him are the same as those who have never sinned.</li>
	<li>A man whose sin is forgiven will always have peace in his heart. All the heavy burdens are taken away.</li>
	<li>Obtaining the joy of salvation: a man whose sins are forgiven shall always flow out songs of deliverance (Psa. 32:7).</li>
	</ol></li>
