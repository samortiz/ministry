<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> This book is composed of messages concerning the course of the church given by Brother Witness Lee during a training on service in Taipei, Taiwan in 1956. The general subject of this training was &ldquo;The Three Aspects of the Church.&rdquo; The first aspect is the meaning of the church; the second, the course of the church; and the third, the organization of the church. The messages given in this training were compiled into three books, according to the three aforementioned aspects; these books are entitled: <em>The Meaning of the Church, The Course of the Church,</em> and <em>The Organization of the Church.</em></p>

<h1 class="title">THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>The course of the church means the progression of the church, or what we normally call the history of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN ETERNITY PAST</h2>
<p>When we speak of the course of the church, we are referring to the origin and the progression of the church, and we must begin with eternity. The church came out from God&rsquo;s eternal plan; therefore, in eternity past, before the creation of all things, God&rsquo;s intention was the church. This means that in God&rsquo;s intention the church has existed from eternity past. This is why we can say that apart from the Triune God, the church is the most ancient thing (Eph. 3:9-11; 1:4-11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIDDEN IN GOD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Church Being a Mystery Hidden in God</h2>
<p>Even though the church existed from eternity past, it was hidden in God (3:9). In other words, even though God wanted the church in eternity past, He did not tell anyone&mdash;not even the angels&mdash;anything about the church. In creation the church was God&rsquo;s direction, His goal. God created all things in order to build the church; His creation was directed toward the church, and the church was its goal. Moreover, many aspects of creation typify the church. Nevertheless, God did not tell anyone about His intention, direction, or goal. Therefore, the church definitely existed but was hidden, and because it was hidden, it was a mystery.</p>
<p>If I had some word to speak but never opened my mouth, everyone would say that I was hiding some mystery. If I have something to say, but I hide it in my heart, it is a mystery. In the same way, the church was a mystery because it was hidden in God from eternity past; it existed, but it was not spoken of, because it was hidden in God. During the time that the church was hidden, only God Himself knew about it; no one else knew about the church.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that there were some important types of the church in creation, the angels and the people of the Old Testament did not understand them. In the Old Testament age, many people, matters, and things typified or symbolized the church. However, the people who passed through these incidents or read about them later did not understand that these stories indicated and referred to the church, because in the Old Testament age the church was still hidden in God. Some people read the Old Testament inaccurately, thinking that the church is in the Old Testament. On the contrary, the Old Testament never directly speaks of the church; rather, it contains only implications and types instead of plain words. This does not mean that the church did not exist before the New Testament age. The church has existed from eternity, but before the New Testament age it was always hidden in God. The church was hidden until the time of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The mystery spoken of in Ephesians 3:3-6 is the church. Verse 4 says, &ldquo;By which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ.&rdquo; The mystery of Christ is the church. Christ&rsquo;s mysterious story is in the church; it can be said that without the church, Christ would no longer be a mystery. Thus, the central point in the mystery of Christ is the church. To know the mystery of Christ is to know the church.</p>
<p>The first part of verse 5 says, &ldquo;Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men.&rdquo; <em>Other generations</em> refers to the generations before the age of the apostles. God did not make the mystery known to men in the age of Adam, in the age of Abraham, or even in the age of the prophets. Not even Isaiah and the other prophets, who foretold the incarnation of the Lord Jesus, knew about this mystery, the church. In other generations God never made the church known to man &ldquo;as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit&rdquo; (v. 5b). The word <em>prophets</em> does not refer to Old Testament prophets but to New Testament prophets, like the ones in Acts 13:1: &ldquo;Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.&rdquo; The prophets in the New Testament received revelation from the Holy Spirit. When the apostles and the prophets came forth at the beginning of the New Testament age, the Holy Spirit revealed and opened up the mystery to them.</p>
<p>Ephesians 3:6 continues to say that this mystery is &ldquo;that in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel.&rdquo; This shows that the mystery from eternity past was a mystery hidden in God. From eternity past through the Old Testament age up until the apostles and prophets of the New Testament, this mystery was hidden. In other words, this mystery was hidden from eternity past until the apostles and prophets received the revelation.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:26 says, &ldquo;The mystery which has been hidden from the ages and from the generations but now has been manifested to His saints.&rdquo; In the past it was a mystery, but now it has been manifested. Verse 26 does not clearly say the word <em>church,</em> but from verse 24 we can see that this mystery is the church. Verse 24 clearly says, &ldquo;His Body, which is the church.&rdquo; The first time the Bible speaks of the church is in Matthew 16:18. The second time is in Matthew 18:17. These two verses were spoken by the Lord to His disciples when He was on the earth. In other words, the Lord spoke of the church only after He was incarnated and recognized by His disciples as the Christ, the Son of the living God (16:15-16). The Lord said, &ldquo;I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18); <em>will</em> indicates that the church had not yet been built. Thus, at the time the Lord spoke this word, from the human perspective the church still seemed to be something in the future, but in reality the church existed for a long time in God. Before the time of the New Testament, however, the church was a mystery hidden in God.</p><h2 class="head2">Two Sections of the Mystery</h2>
<p>The true meaning of the universe is a story of God and His relationship with man, and this story, this relationship, is a mystery which has two sections.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Mystery of God</h2>
<p>Colossians 2:2 says, &ldquo;The mystery of God, Christ.&rdquo; The mystery of God is manifested in Christ, so Christ is the mystery of God. To use a more colloquial expression, we could change <em>mystery</em> to <em>story.</em> God&rsquo;s entire story is in Christ. Apart from Christ, man cannot find the story of God. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.&rdquo; All matters concerning God&mdash;all His stories, all the mysteries that man cannot understand&mdash;are in Christ. Christ is the mystery of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Mystery of Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:4-6 says that the mystery of Christ is the church. Christ Himself is a mystery, but all the matters concerning Christ, all the stories of Christ, and all the contents of the mystery have been placed in the church; therefore, the church is the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p>Colossians speaks of the mystery of God, and Ephesians speaks of the mystery of Christ. We need to make a distinction between these two: the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church. Although these two are one, there are particular details concerning each. Colossians speaks of the Head, Christ, and Ephesians speaks of the Body, the church. Just as Colossians tells how Christ is the Head, Ephesians tells how the church is the Body. The head and the body must be put together before we have a complete person; this is a great mystery.</p>
<p>Christ, the Head, is the mystery of God, and all the stories of God are in Christ as the Head and related to Christ. On the other hand, the church, the Body, is the mystery of Christ, and all the stories of Christ are in the church as His Body. These are two aspects of one mystery. The mystery of God is the mystery of Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the mystery of God.</p>
<p>All the stories of God are in Christ, the Head; all the mysteries of Christ, the Head, are in the Body, the church. Thus, when we speak of the mystery of God, we are emphasizing the stories of God that are manifested in Christ, and when we speak of the mystery of Christ, we are emphasizing the stories of Christ that are manifested in the church. Christ plus the church is a great mystery. First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: / He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; This verse speaks forth a story of God and man, man and God. If we would know the mystery, story, and matters of God and man, man and God, then we must know Christ and the church. Christ is a mystery, and the church is a mystery. Christ is a part of the mystery, the first step of the mystery; the church is another part of the mystery, the second step of the mystery. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ; all the stories of God are in Christ, and all the stories of Christ are in the church. Therefore, if we want to know God, we must know Christ, and if we want to know Christ, we must know the church.</p>
<p>This mysterious story began in eternity past and passed through many generations by being hidden in God Himself. God did not tell anyone; He did not even reveal it to the angels who serve before Him every day, including the archangel Michael. Even the patriarchs and prophets in the Old Testament who were closest to God did not know about it. Only at the beginning of the New Testament did God reveal the church. Thus, apart from the characteristics of being eternal, heavenly, and spiritual, the church also has the characteristic of being mysterious. The church&rsquo;s nature is mysterious because it was a mystery hidden in God. The second section of the course of the church involves its being hidden in God.</p><h2 class="head1">REVEALED IN TIME</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Revelation concerning the Church</h2>
<p>The third item of the course of the church is that it is revealed in time. This revelation began in Matthew 16:18. The Lord revealed the church in Matthew 16, because at that time Christ as the mystery of God had been manifested. Therefore, Christ could reveal His own mystery. Since God had been manifested in the flesh, Christ could reveal His own mystery, the church.</p>
<p>Matthew 16 is a great turn in the Bible; it speaks of Christ, the church, and the cross. Every reader of the Bible must emphasize Matthew 16. In this chapter the first great turn is the turn to Christ, the second great turn is the turn to the church, and the third great turn is the turn to the cross. Christ, the church, and the cross are all very great matters.</p>
<p>After Christ was manifested, the mystery of God was no longer hidden, but not until Matthew 16 was this mystery openly known by man. At that time the Lord Jesus was in Caesarea Philippi, and He asked His disciples, &ldquo;Who do men say that the Son of Man is?&rdquo; (v. 13). When the Lord Jesus asked this, He meant, &ldquo;I, Jesus the Nazarene, am a mystery. You must try to tell Me about this mystery. What kind of a story am I? What do people say? What do you, My followers, say that I am?&rdquo; If He had used spiritual words to ask, He would have said, &ldquo;Who do men say that I, the mystery, am? Who do you say that I, the mystery, am?&rdquo; Among them Peter said, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (v. 16). This meant that the mystery of God was not only manifested among men but also recognized by men. At the very least, in the human race at that time Peter knew that this mystery was the Son of the living God; this knowledge was a great matter. Oh, confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness! God was manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16).</p>
<p>We have the assurance that our God was very happy in Matthew 16. In Luke 15 we see the joy of God the Father, signified by the father&rsquo;s rejoicing at the younger son&rsquo;s return (v. 24). However, in Luke 15 the joy is small; in Matthew 16 God&rsquo;s joy is greater because on that day God&rsquo;s mystery in the universe was known by man. On that day there was not only the reality of Christ as the mystery of God, but He also was known by man. Therefore, the Lord responded, &ldquo;Blessed are you, Simon Barjona&rdquo; (v. 17). In the original language, <em>blessed</em> and <em>joy</em> are the same word; there is no way to distinguish between blessing and joy. The Lord said that Peter was blessed, indicating that God was rejoicing.</p>
<p>The mystery of God&mdash;Christ&mdash;was recognized by man; in other words, the first aspect of the mystery was known by man. This is the reason the Lord immediately said to Peter, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter [the Greek word meaning &ldquo;stone&rdquo;], and upon this rock I will build My church&rdquo; (v. 18). The rock is the mystery of God, which is Christ. The church is built upon the mystery of God, so the church also is a mystery. Just as Christ is the mystery of God, the church is the mystery of Christ. Since the first aspect of the mystery was known by man, the second aspect could be revealed to man. These are the two aspects of the mystery. The first aspect was known by man, and the second was revealed to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Two Steps of Revelation</h2>
<p>Since the mystery was hidden, it needed to be revealed. Even though the Lord revealed the church in Matthew 16, the revelation that the church is the mystery of Christ was at that time rather objective. Of course, there were some subjective elements in it, such as the Lord saying to Peter that he was a stone and that He would build His church upon Himself as the rock of the foundation. The Lord Jesus meant that Peter was a part of the church that He would build. Thus, as far as Peter was concerned, this was a subjective revelation, but it was still not fully subjective. Only when the apostle Paul wrote the book of Ephesians did this revelation become completely and fully subjective.</p>
<p>A revelation usually has two steps: prophecy and fulfillment. Isaiah 7:14 prophesied that the Lord would become flesh, that is, that the mystery of God would be manifested. This revelation was a prophecy, not the fulfillment. It was not until the Gospels that the mystery of God was fulfilled and manifested. In Matthew 16, when Peter spoke of Christ as the Son of God, he obtained a revelation. This revelation was not a prophecy; it was the fulfillment. Peter saw the fact of the incarnation.</p>
<p>The revelation of the church also has the two steps of prophecy and fulfillment. In Matthew 16, when the Lord revealed the church, the church had not yet been produced. This is similar to the situation in Isaiah 7:14, when the prophet wrote, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; At that time Christ had not yet come. Just as Isaiah 7 is a prophetic revelation of Christ, Matthew 16 is a prophetic revelation of the church. In Matthew 16 the mystery of God was recognized by man, so the Lord could use the way of prophecy to further reveal the mystery of Christ. When Paul wrote the book of Ephesians, the revelation concerning the church was no longer related only to prophecy but rather was related to the fulfillment. Paul revealed the mystery that had been manifested but was not yet understood by men.</p>
<p>Thus, the mystery has two aspects, and each aspect of the mystery has two steps in its revelation. The first aspect of the mystery is the mystery of God, which is Christ; this aspect had the first step of revelation in the Old Testament. When the Lord was incarnated and manifested before the disciples, He was recognized by Peter, and this was the second step, the fulfillment of the revelation. This step of the revelation was received by Peter. The second aspect of the mystery is the mystery of Christ, which is the church. The church was never clearly revealed in the Old Testament and was not revealed in prophecy until the Lord spoke about it in Matthew 16.</p>
<p>Isaiah 7:14 is the prophetic revelation of the first aspect of the mystery, which was fulfilled in Bethlehem, and in Matthew 16:16 Peter received the revelation of this fulfillment. Likewise, Matthew 16:18 is the prophetic revelation of the second aspect of the mystery, which was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. However, the revelation of the fulfillment of this aspect of the mystery was not given until Paul wrote the book of Ephesians. In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would build His church, and in Ephesians Paul wrote that the church had come into existence. The apostle Paul could point to the church and say, &ldquo;This is the church, the mystery of Christ, the mystery which has been hidden throughout the ages and the generations but now has been placed before you.&rdquo; Moreover, all of us who are in the church are this mystery; this mystery is in you and me. This is the third step in the course of the church, the step of being revealed in time.</p><h2 class="head1">PRODUCED ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST</h2>
<p>When we speak of the revelation of the church, we must go back prior to the day of Pentecost, to the time before the work on the cross had been accomplished. When we speak of the producing of the church, the fulfillment of the church, however, we must begin with the day of Pentecost. The church was first planned, then hidden, then revealed, and finally fulfilled. On the day of Pentecost the church was not only in God&rsquo;s thought, but it had actually come out from within God. By the day of Pentecost, the church was not just spoken of and revealed but also fulfilled and produced.</p>
<p>If I put a Bible in my coat, some people can see that something is hidden and may ask, &ldquo;Brother, what do you have hidden in your coat?&rdquo; If no one knows and if I do not tell anyone, the Bible is a mystery hidden in me. But I may ask a certain brother, &ldquo;Do you know what is in my coat?&rdquo; Then I would tell him that I have a Bible hidden in my coat, and he may understand that I have a Bible hidden in my coat, but he still has not seen it. This kind of understanding is the same as that in Matthew 16. In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would build His church upon the mystery of God&rsquo;s incarnation. This was a revelation, but it was also a prophecy, because at that time the church was not yet built. This is just like the Bible in my coat; one may know that it is there, but he has not yet seen it. If I take this Bible out of my coat, he will see it totally and clearly. This is the story of Pentecost. On the day of Pentecost, the church was produced out of God. God clearly showed the church to the universe; therefore, all creation knew that the mystery in God was the church.</p>
<p>Whatever is produced out of God is God. In the beginning, when God created the heavens, the earth, and all things, all the angels seemed to wonder, &ldquo;What kind of story is this? Why has God created the heavens, the earth, and all things?&rdquo; They did not understand. When God created Adam, called Abraham, and even inspired the prophet Isaiah, no one understood the real meaning of the universe. The angels did not understand, humans did not understand, God&rsquo;s chosen people did not understand, and even God&rsquo;s prophets did not understand. It was not until Matthew 16, when the mysterious, incarnated One was recognized, that the second aspect of the mystery was revealed. However, this speaking was in the way of prophecy only. On the day of Pentecost, however, the church was properly produced, and the first aspect of the mystery became the second aspect of the mystery. The first aspect of the mystery is the mystery of God, Christ; the second aspect of the mystery is the mystery of Christ, the church.</p>
<p>Matthew 16 does not merely contain the two revelations of Christ and of the church; it also has a third revelation&mdash;the revelation concerning the cross. But in this message we will emphasize only the first two revelations.</p>
<p>The two revelations in Matthew 16 are a revelation of the fulfillment of Christ as the mystery of God and a prophetic revelation of the church as the mystery of Christ. The revelation of the fulfillment was given by God, and the prophetic revelation was given by the Son. The Father revealed Christ as the mystery of God, and the Son revealed the church as the mystery of Christ. The Father told Peter about His mystery, and the Son told Peter about His mystery. The Father revealed the fulfillment because Christ already had been incarnated. The Son revealed the prophecy because the enlargement of the incarnated Christ, the church, had not yet been fulfilled.</p>
<p>It was not until the day of Pentecost that the church was produced; it came out from within God and was manifested among men, becoming the fulfillment placed before men and put within men. Despite the fact that the church was fulfilled, it was still a mystery to most people. After the incarnation at Bethlehem, the mystery of God was manifested among men, but most people saw the mystery without understanding it. They still said, &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter&rsquo;s son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And His sisters, are they not all with us?&rdquo; (13:55-56; John 6:42; Luke 4:22). Just as people did not understand the first aspect of the mystery in Bethlehem, they did not understand the fulfilled mystery of Christ on the day of Pentecost. They seemed to be asking, &ldquo;Are these not Galilean fishermen? Are they not uneducated men and laymen? How can they do these things? Where did they get this boldness? Where did they get such wisdom?&rdquo; The people did not know that they were seeing the enlargement of the mystery of God, which had become the mystery of Christ. The day of Pentecost was a large Bethlehem; Bethlehem enlarged is Pentecost. The mystery of God was fulfilled at Bethlehem, and the mystery of Christ was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost. The fulfillment of this mystery was the producing of the church.</p>
<p>Those who know the Bible acknowledge that the entire Bible speaks of one mystery in two aspects. The first aspect is the mystery of God, Christ; the second aspect is the mystery of Christ, the church. Christ is the mystery of God, and the church is the mystery of Christ. When people today see Christ, they understand God; when they see the church, they understand Christ. Christ is the expression of God, and the church is the expression of Christ; these two are two parts of one mystery. All the good, important things in the Bible depend upon this mystery. Therefore, if we do not know this mystery with two aspects, we do not know the Bible. If we know this mystery, we can understand the Bible. The Bible is not merely a book of dead letters; it is living, full of the supply of life and power.</p>
<p>People think that the Bible is a book of dead letters because they have not seen that the Bible is a narrative of this great mystery of two aspects. People have not seen that the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation speaks only of this mystery in two aspects. When we put Genesis 1:26-27 together with Revelation 22:21, we can see that the entire Bible is about a mysterious man who is in the image of God and who can exercise authority for God; this mysterious man is Christ (the Head) and the church (the Body).</p>
<p>This mystery is such a great matter that we must not only see it for ourselves, but we must also bring others into seeing it. In our living, we do not need to exhort people to have patience; when they see the mystery, they will have patience. Neither do we need to exhort people to love one another; when they see this mystery, they will have love within them. Many who work for God pursue power and abundant life without realizing that as long as they touch this mystery, there is power and abundant life. This mystery is everything.</p>
<p>We are not able to be patient and holy or to have love and power in ourselves; everything rests with this mystery. God wants to work this mystery into us, and the result is the church. We must not only thoroughly know this matter, but we must also have much experience. In this way our living, our service, our work, and our administration of the church will be unspeakably high, weighty, and full of rich content. May the Lord open our eyes so that we may see this precious matter. This is what the church needs today. We absolutely believe and deeply feel that what the Lord wants to do in these last days is to build up the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>The church was not only hidden in God in eternity past; it was also revealed in time, produced at Pentecost, and spread on the earth.</p>
<p>The spreading of the church not only took place in time, but it also occurred on the earth. After the church was produced at Pentecost, it has been constantly spreading for the past two thousand years and has spread everywhere.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is that there would be a church in the universe; He does not want the church to be in only one locality. In other words, the church that God wants is a church in the whole universe and not simply a church in one place. Even though the church has representative manifestations in many different localities, it is universal, not local. Thus, when the church was produced on the day of Pentecost, even though it was produced in Jerusalem, its nature was not merely that of the church in Jerusalem. The church is universal, not only in Jerusalem. The church was produced in Jerusalem, but it could not be kept in Jerusalem. The church was produced in Jerusalem, but it did not grow only in Jerusalem. The church can be produced in one place, but it is impossible to continue the church in one place forever and force it to grow only there. Because the church is universal, it must not only be produced, but it must also spread. The church is universal, so it must spread.</p>
<p>Both the cross and the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation at Bethlehem have a universal impact. Although the Lord was born in Bethlehem, His birth was not merely for Bethlehem. The incarnation was not local; it was for the universe. The church is the same; even though it was produced in Jerusalem, it is for more than Jerusalem alone. The church is for the whole universe; it is eternal, and it transcends time and space. The church can appear in time and in a certain place, but it is not merely in time and of that place. The church transcends time and place; the church is universal.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a local church does not spread, the nature of that church is too low, and it will lose its universal and eternal character. In principle, the church must spread, and the faster, the farther, and the more it spreads, the better. But when we speak of the spread of the church, we must be careful. This spreading is not promoted by human methods, nor is it worked out by human hands. The spreading of the church is brought about by the growth in the Lord&rsquo;s life. On man&rsquo;s side, the church cannot grow quickly, and we should not be greedy for speed. However, on God&rsquo;s side, the church must spread. Not long after the church in Jerusalem was raised up, God caused His children to be scattered to various places by persecution.</p>
<p>The spreading of the church can break through many barriers and eliminate many undesirable practices. In many places where the church is raised up, however, the saints may be narrow-minded. This was the case in Jerusalem. They had many Old Testament traditions and teachings that caused them to close themselves off from others. If we were to say that there was a people on the earth who were closed and sealed up, we would say it was the Jews. They sealed themselves up and despised other people; moreover, they did not communicate with others.</p>
<p>Peter was the top apostle who saw the vision of the mystery of God and heard the prophecies of the mystery of Christ. Despite the fact that he received the revelation, he almost brought the church into the limitations of Judaism. In Peter&rsquo;s mind the church belonged to Jerusalem and to the Jews and should not go to the Gentile lands or to the Gentile people; however, the church had to spread. When the church begins to spread, erroneous concepts are shattered, regardless of whether the concepts are regional, racial, or mutually discriminatory. When the church begins to spread, concepts are smashed and cease to exist.</p>
<p>We must apply these points to ourselves; I am afraid that we still have many regional concepts. We anxiously expect a spiritual rain to fall on our locality. It does not matter to us when other localities are in the middle of a great drought as long as our locality has the autumn and spring rains. We do not seem to be concerned in the least whether meetings in other localities are living. Our concern is only that our locality would have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. It is very difficult to break through this kind of local concept and regional thinking.</p>
<p>It is possible for us to even come together to seek the Lord&rsquo;s will, kneeling in prayer, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, Your will be done among us as it is in heaven. We truly want to let You be the Head and to allow You to reign among us.&rdquo; Such a prayer seems very spiritual, but after we sit down and begin to discuss where to send the brothers to work, someone might suggest, &ldquo;Let us transfer Brother So-and-so from Taichung to Kaohsiung because he really knows how to serve and is very gifted.&rdquo; After this suggestion, however, the responsible brothers from Taichung would strongly react and say, &ldquo;If you are going to do that, Taichung should close its doors.&rdquo; On the other side, the leading brothers from Kaohsiung would be ecstatic and joyful, and they would be full of praise to the Lord because they had been praying for this and would feel that the Lord answered their prayers.</p>
<p>If we have such situations in the church, how can the church progress and spread? Because it is not easy to break through the regional concepts within people, the church needs to spread even more. It is through spreading that all our close-mindedness is eliminated. The New Testament shows that not long after the church in Jerusalem was raised up, God seemed to throw a huge stone into her midst; it seemed like a big &ldquo;bomb,&rdquo; scattering the saints by its impact and forcing them to leave Jerusalem. God intervened because the church is neither of the Jews nor of Jerusalem; the church is universal.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF THE SPREADING<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s record in the Bible is marvelous. From Acts we see the process of the spreading of the church, and by this we know the church&rsquo;s course on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Samaria</h2>
<p>Acts 8 shows that the first step in the disciples&rsquo; scattering&mdash;that is, the first place to which they were scattered&mdash;was not to Bethlehem but to Samaria (vv. 1-25). Samaria lies between Judea and the Gentile lands, and the Samaritans were a racial mixture of Jews and Gentiles. The Samaritans considered themselves to be Jews, but the Jews repeatedly rejected them and did not acknowledge them as Jews. After the Samaritans were saved, the saints in Jerusalem were very surprised and sent the apostles to visit them. When the apostles came and prayed for the Samaritans, the Holy Spirit immediately descended; thus, God Himself confirmed this spread (vv. 15-17). It was as if the Holy Spirit was saying to Peter, &ldquo;This is of Me; I did it. You should not stay only in Jerusalem; you must spread.&rdquo; God confirmed that the church needed to spread; therefore, the first step in the church&rsquo;s spread was to Samaria, to a people who were partly Jew and partly Gentile.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ethiopia</h2>
<p>From Acts 8 the second step of the church&rsquo;s spread was through Philip&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel to an Ethiopian eunuch; thus, the gospel spread to Africa (vv. 26-39). The Jews never thought that God would call the Gentiles to hear the gospel, receive salvation, and become the church. The Jewish mind was too narrow; they would never have thought of such a thing. But one day an angel of the Lord came and spoke to Philip, saying, &ldquo;Rise up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza&rdquo; (v. 26). That was a desert route; Philip obeyed and went. On the way he saw the chariot of an Ethiopian eunuch, and the Holy Spirit said to Philip, &ldquo;Approach and join this chariot&rdquo; (v. 29). Philip went forward and came up to the Ethiopian eunuch. Philip did these things not by himself but under the leading of the Holy Spirit. He not only preached the gospel to the eunuch and led him to believe in the Lord and be saved, but he also baptized him. When Philip and the eunuch came up from the water, the Holy Spirit caught Philip away. The fact that the Holy Spirit caught Philip away confirmed that Philip&rsquo;s actions were not only of the Holy Spirit but also that they were complete and perfect.</p>
<p>Church history tells us that from that time onward, the gospel spread to Ethiopia in Africa, which is the Cush spoken of in the book of Isaiah (18:1). Over the past two thousand years there have always been Christians there, and their beginning was in Acts 8. Thus, the Lord did not wait until the time at the house of Cornelius to spread the gospel to the Gentiles. In Acts 8 the gospel spread to Africa; however, it was not a white Gentile who received the gospel but a black one, a descendant of Ham (Gen. 10:6). The cursed race received the gospel.</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament, it was not pleasing to God for His children to have a relationship with the Egyptians, but God&rsquo;s deeds are truly marvelous; His first step was to spread the gospel to the racially mixed Samaritans and then to preach to the cursed black people. These peoples were despised by the Jews, but the Holy Spirit caused some from both groups to be saved and to become the church. We must never despise a person&rsquo;s race. It does not matter whether a race has a low culture, is morally corrupt, or is poor in character; we cannot despise them. We must preach the gospel to all peoples because the church is universal and needs to spread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Paul</h2>
<p>Acts 9 shows God&rsquo;s choosing of Paul, who was called Saul at that time. He did not choose someone who was sympathetic to Christians and a believer in Christ; on the contrary, He chose a person who persecuted Christians and opposed the Lord. The person God saved and chose to be an apostle was not a pious person who obeyed God but a person who opposed God, persecuted the church, and inflicted harm on Christians.</p>
<p>The path of the church&rsquo;s spreading in Acts is marvelous. Saul had asked for letters from the high priest in Jerusalem and was on the road going down to Damascus to harm the Christians when the Lord met him and saved him (vv. 1-9). After this, the Lord spoke to Ananias and sent him to visit Saul. The response Ananias gave to the Lord was according to his concept. To him, Saul was one who had persecuted and harmed those who believed in the Lord&rsquo;s name (vv. 13-14); he was one who approved of the killing of Stephen (8:1a) and persecuted the church. Ananias could not understand why the gospel should be preached to Saul. This is the human concept; therefore, God did something to shatter this concept. Our narrow, erroneous human concept needs to be broken and shattered through the spreading of the church.</p>
<p>We must believe that a person can be persecuting the church one hour and preaching the gospel the next hour. God is able to do this because He wants to spread. During the age of the apostles, there are many examples which show that God can spread the church to many people whom we think cannot possibly become the church. This is the case of the Samaritans, the Ethiopian eunuch, and Saul of Tarsus. After Ananias received the revelation and went to visit Saul, the Holy Spirit descended to confirm this matter. Later, Paul returned to Jerusalem, and all the disciples in Jerusalem and elsewhere who heard of his salvation were surprised because they never thought that such a thing could happen. In their minds Saul could never be saved. Despite the fact that they were afraid of Paul, they ultimately received him (9:26-28). Their reluctance shows that it is truly difficult for people to quickly receive someone like Saul; human concepts are actually a great hindrance to the church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Household of Cornelius in Caesarea</h2>
<p>Acts 10 speaks of the household of Cornelius in Caesarea. The gospel being preached to the Samaritans was tolerable to the Jews because the Samaritans were a people of mixed Jewish and Gentile blood. The preaching of the gospel to the Ethiopian may have been considered a coincidence by the apostles. And even though Paul had opposed the Lord, he still was of the tribe of Benjamin and considered to be an Israelite (Phil. 3:5). The Jewish believers could tolerate and accept all of these.</p>
<p>In Acts 10, however, God wanted the apostles to preach the gospel to Cornelius, a representative of the Gentiles, and it was difficult to break through. Because Cornelius was a centurion in the Roman legion, he was fully representative of the Gentiles. It was not easy for someone to go to his home and preach the gospel to him, to his family, and to his friends, and the Holy Spirit met resistance in Peter (v. 14). From the record in Acts we see that Peter strongly felt that the church was Jewish and should be in Judea. Peter did not have the concept that the church is universal and did not think that the church needed to spread.</p>
<p>Because of this, the Holy Spirit did a marvelous thing. He showed Peter a vision of &ldquo;a great sheet&rdquo; (v. 11), which represents the gospel. All kinds of things were in that sheet, both the things that Peter considered clean and the things that Peter considered unclean. This means that all kinds of people were in the sheet. A voice told Peter that he should rise up and &ldquo;slay and eat&rdquo; (v. 13). All kinds of people were there, and to &ldquo;slay and eat&rdquo; means that Peter needed to be mingled with them. Eating is taking something outside of us and receiving it into us, making it one with us. Eating is not simply a matter of contacting something, nor is it merely a matter of touching something. On the contrary, eating is taking things and swallowing them; it is a matter of mingling. God showed Peter this vision because He wanted to tell him, &ldquo;You, Peter, a Jew, must be mingled with Cornelius, a Gentile, to become one church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter did not understand and refused three times (v. 16). Eventually, Peter obeyed the Spirit and went to the house of Cornelius, and while he was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word (v. 44). This told Peter and those with him that the church is not of the Jews and that it must spread to the Gentiles; the church is not local but universal. After Peter and the other six brothers returned to Jerusalem, the saints in Jerusalem still did not understand. Peter stood up to testify and told them, &ldquo;As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as also on us in the beginning&rdquo; (11:15). The Holy Spirit fell on the members of the household of Cornelius just as He fell on the Jews in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. Since the work of the Holy Spirit was evident, no one could say anything. This properly and formally opened the door of the gospel to the Gentiles. At this time Peter used the keys of the kingdom to fully open the doors of the church.</p>
<p>In Matthew 16 the Lord said that He would give the keys of the kingdom of the heavens to Peter (v. 19). Peter opened a door on the day of Pentecost, but in the house of Cornelius, he opened another door. On the day of Pentecost he opened the door for the Jews; however, in the house of Cornelius he opened the door for the Gentiles. The salvation of the Jewish Samaritans and the salvation of the Ethiopian eunuch were only an &ldquo;advance opening&rdquo;; the salvation of the household of Cornelius was the &ldquo;grand opening.&rdquo; At this time the Holy Spirit officially spread the church to the Gentiles and broke down the wall.</p>
<p>If the church stayed in one place, it would have more and more problems. In order for the church to eliminate its problems, it must spread; once the church spreads, problems will disappear. Because of the spreading to the household of Cornelius, the Jews expanded their narrow view. Their narrow view, prejudiced hearts, regional concepts, and things not up to the standard of the Body were eliminated. The church was still not fully formed on the day of Pentecost. After the household of Cornelius was saved, however, it was fully formed.</p>
<p>The more kinds of people in the local churches, the better. For example, in a meeting someone may speak in English while others translate into Chinese, Japanese, and Taiwanese. This is a beautiful scene of the spreading of the church.</p>
<p>Because the church is universal, it is also spreading. The most blessed church is the church that spreads the most. If there is a local church that never spreads, it will have more and more problems until it becomes very weak. On the one hand, we must be careful and serious about the spreading of the church, not being loose or careless and using human methods to promote it. We must allow the Lord to work. On the other hand, we must be clear that the church needs to spread, and we must do our best to raise up churches in every place. Although this does not depend on human effort, we should not limit the spreading.</p>
<p>We should not have the slightest limitation that could cause the church to stop spreading. Promoting the church&rsquo;s spread through human work is ineffective and will not last, but we should bear the responsibility to allow the church to spread in order to eliminate our narrow concepts. The basic principle of the church is that it is eternal and universal; the church must constantly spread on the earth. The growth of the church and the building up of the church are based on spreading.</p><h2 class="head2">Antioch</h2>
<p>The church in Antioch was also part of the story of the church&rsquo;s spreading (Acts 13:1). In Antioch there were five prophets and teachers, of whom the first was Barnabas, a Levite. The Levites were not ordinary Jews but the Jews of the Jews, because the Jewish religion was in their hands. The Levites served God exclusively.</p>
<p>The second person was Simeon, who was called Niger. <em>Niger</em> means &ldquo;black&rdquo; and denotes a man of the black race, probably of African origin. Among those five prophets and teachers, there was a black man. The third was Lucius the Cyrenian. Cyrene is in northern Africa, so Lucius was an African; however, he was not necessarily a black man. The fourth was Manaen, the foster brother of Herod the tetrarch; Manaen was a noble, and not necessarily a Jew.</p>
<p>The last one was Paul, who was a Pharisee trained at the feet of Gamaliel and who zealously kept all the ordinances in Judaism (22:3); therefore, his Jewish concept was very strong. Even though Barnabas was a Levite, Paul&rsquo;s original Jewish concept may have been deeper than that of Barnabas.</p>
<p>In the church in Antioch there were no distinctions; all these people were not merely in the church but were leaders in the church. Among them were Jews and Gentiles and people of different races; the church in Antioch was a church without divisions. This is something that only the Holy Spirit could have accomplished. The church in Antioch was more fully formed than the situation in the house of Cornelius. The church in Jerusalem is not the pattern; the church in Antioch is the real pattern. The church in Antioch had completely left all the Jewish influence behind. Through such a church the Holy Spirit was able to move forward to spread without any limitations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Cyprus</h2>
<p>The good situation in Antioch, however, was still not enough, so the Holy Spirit came and sent forth Barnabas and Paul to the work; their goal was the spreading of the church (13:2-12). We can see the spread of the church by tracing the footsteps of these apostles.</p>
<p>After being sent out by the Holy Spirit, the apostles went to Seleucia and from there they sailed to the island of Cyprus. This Cyprus is the island of Cyprus today. Then they went to Asia Minor, which was a place of the Gentiles. Even though Cyprus was a Gentile place, the apostles used Jewish synagogues to preach the word when they first arrived (v. 5). The presence of these synagogues shows God&rsquo;s preparation. Before the Lord Jesus was born, God scattered Jews all over the earth, and in every place that there were Jews, they built social organizations. Their social organization was centered around the synagogues, just as it centered around the temple in Jerusalem. Every Sabbath there would be people in the synagogues studying the Bible; the Jews also brought Gentiles to hear the name of God and to meet the true God, the Creator of all things. &ldquo;Those who fear God,&rdquo; as spoken of in Acts 13:16, were Gentiles who were seeking God. God prepared all of this ahead of time.</p>
<p>When the apostles went out to the Gentile lands, they would go first to the Jewish synagogues and use them to preach the gospel to God&rsquo;s Old Testament elect; then they would turn from the Jews to the Gentiles. At this time, the spread of the church was very strong. When we read the book of Acts, we should draw a map, and whenever we come to a place, we should fill in its name and note on which trip the apostle visited it; furthermore, we should study the spiritual characteristics of each place. This will be a big help to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Asia Minor</h2>
<p>On the apostle Paul&rsquo;s first trip to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to establish churches among them, he went to Cyprus. He did not stay there long before continuing on to Asia Minor, which is modern-day Turkey. In Asia Minor he established many local churches, which represents a further step in the spread of the church (Acts 13&mdash;14).</p>
<p>In the beginning, even though the apostles preached the gospel to the Gentiles, they were still among the Jews; therefore, at the end of Acts 13 it says that they turned to the Gentiles (v. 46). This shows that even though they were in Gentile lands in Asia Minor, they were still preaching to the Jews. Beginning in chapter 13, the apostles shook off the dust of their feet (v. 51) as a formal sign that they were turning to the Gentiles in the Gentile land. Therefore, the church did not only spread in Gentile lands but also to Gentile people. In chapter 14 the universal church finally was fully formed.</p>
<p>If we read Acts carefully, we can see the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s intention to spread the church, not only geographically but also to different races. After the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to Taiwan and churches were established, we spontaneously hoped that the gospel would be preached among the local people. This is the spreading of the church. On the one hand, the church spread from the Jewish lands to Gentile regions, and on the other hand, it spread from the Jewish people to the Gentile people.</p>
<p>At the time of Paul&rsquo;s first ministry journey, the spreading of the church was very strong. Furthermore, the spreading in the Gentile regions laid the foundation for the church throughout history. The last portion of the Bible speaks of seven epistles to the seven churches in Asia Minor (Rev. 1:4). These seven churches represent the church throughout the generations. Later, the apostles returned to Antioch, and at that time there were no problems in the church in Antioch. They could only declare the things that God had done with them and that God had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles (Acts 14:26-27).</p>
<p>The church spread, many walls were broken down, and the church became universal. In the matter of geography, the church is universal; in the matter of race, the church is also universal. However, Jerusalem was still a problem, and some came from Jerusalem with the intention of making the church into a church of the Jews; they wanted to bring Jewish things into the church (15:1-2). If people limit the way of the church or the spread of the church, they will miss a great blessing. In contrast, any person or place that allows the church to have a way will receive a special blessing from God. We must be saved from all the problems within us to allow the church to spread continually without any limitations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Europe</h2>
<p>After Paul separated from Barnabas (vv. 35-39), he went out on his second ministry journey. Paul originally thought that he would work in the region of Asia Minor, but the Holy Spirit gave him a vision and wanted him to go to Macedonia, which is in Europe. Therefore, he established several local churches in Macedonia (16:6&mdash;18:22).</p>
<p>The first church that Paul established in Macedonia was in Philippi (16:12). Of all the churches in Macedonia, Philippi was the healthiest and the best; the next best was the church in Thessalonica (17:1). Although the church in Ephesus was good, it did not compare with the churches in Philippi and Thessalonica. After Thessalonica, the apostle Paul went on to Berea (v. 10), to Athens (v. 15), and then to Corinth (18:1). Thus, the gospel was preached to Europe, and several local churches were established there. Paul then passed through Ephesus (v. 19) on his way back to Antioch (v. 22).</p>
<p>Paul remained in Antioch for some time and then went out a third time to preach the word. In principle, there was not much spreading on his third ministry journey, after which he went to Jerusalem. He may have wanted to go to Antioch, but before he was able to make the trip, he was arrested by the Jews in Jerusalem (22:27-30).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED<br />
IN THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>When the church was spreading, Satan created three problems through various people. These three problems limited the spread of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dead Ordinances</h2>
<p>The first problem encountered in the spread of the church was the limitation and bondage of Judaism (Acts 15:1-34). The believers in Judea were Jews who still kept the traditions of Judaism; they looked at the church from a Jewish viewpoint. They tried to put the church into the &#8220;box&#8221; of Judaism. Satan used human religion and so-called piety to limit the spread of the church. The Jews believed that their law, ordinances, and rituals were from God and pertained to piety; therefore, they considered themselves as those best able to keep God&#8217;s word. Satan used this thought to severely limit the church. Only Paul&#8217;s seeing of the heavenly vision enabled the lifting of this limitation. After Acts 15, when the church spread out, Satan could not continue to use Judaism to limit the church.</p>
<p>Acts 13 shows that when the church was beginning to spread among the Gentiles-in other words, to spread to every place on earth-Satan used Judaism to limit, prevent, and frustrate this spread. This illustrates a principle that we must bear in mind: things that we consider to be pious, such as religious ordinances, forms of worship, and even Bible knowledge, are often used by Satan to limit the church. Throughout church history, each time the church has spread, it has been through a group of people whom God empowered to break through religious rituals, ordinances, and dead letters.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the one hand, we should obey the Bible, walk in its light, and comply with the teachings of the truth; this is proper. On the other hand, however, we must ask ourselves whether our Bible knowledge and our light of the truth are dead or living. If we have only dead doctrines, this will limit and frustrate the church.</p>
<p>Consider the sisters&#8217; preaching of the word. First Corinthians 14 states that sisters should not teach in the meetings (v. 34). We confess that this is a scriptural truth. This is the word of God, but if we keep it as a dead ordinance, it will give Satan ground to come in and limit the spread of the church. For example, a sister came to a remote mountain village one day. There was no church in that place, nor were there any brothers. If that sister kept the dead letter and thus refrained from preaching the word, she would frustrate the work of the Holy Spirit and give Satan an opportunity to limit the spread of the church. All the truths in the Bible are living, not dead. Whenever we take the truth as a dead ordinance, we limit the work of the Holy Spirit; when we limit the work of the Holy Spirit, we limit the spread of the church.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters coordinate together in the Body according to God&#8217;s ordained arrangement, each functioning in his or her place. When there are brothers in the meetings, the sisters should stay in their position and not say anything in the way of teaching. However, this is not a dead regulation but a living practice. Thus, if a sister goes to a locality where there are no brothers, she should not keep this teaching in a dead way. We should not keep so-called truths as dead letters. If we do, we will give Satan ground to limit the spread of the church.</p>
<p>We often say that if we do not have the confirmation of the church, we should not do things alone; we must always act in the Body. This word is not wrong, but if there is a need somewhere and circumstances prevent us from obtaining the confirmation of the church, we should not keep the truth of &#8220;acting in the Body&#8221; as a dead ordinance. If we do, it will limit the spread of the church. If there actually is a need, we should not allow our inability to have a confirmation to cause us to delay; this is to be living and not dead.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the church can give us confirmation, we must check whether we are willing to receive it or if we prefer to do things alone. If the church is present, but we still move on our own, we are wrong. This exposes our flesh and our self. We must be willing to be broken and dealt with and also to act in the fellowship of the Body; this is right and proper. The brothers who are elders or co-workers should not use truths as dead ordinances to bind or rebuke others. They must always be careful to act properly.</p>
<p>If anyone considers the examples in Acts to be dead ordinances for the church to keep, he will kill the church with dead letters. In northern China there is a church that has not spread for more than fifty years because they have kept scriptural truths as dead ordinances. Not only do they take the Old Testament ordinances as ordinances, they also take the principles of the New Testament in this way. This is not right. All the light and principles in the Bible should be applied in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>During the past two thousand years, whenever regulations have bound the church, the Holy Spirit has initiated a reaction to break through the ordinances. We must be careful not to deviate from the Bible; our work, service, establishing of churches, and governing of the church should all be done according to scriptural principles. Nevertheless, whenever we take the principles of the Bible as dead ordinances, we are in the principle of Judaism. The church depends on the Holy Spirit. Man can bind the church, but he cannot bind the Holy Spirit. If we limit the Holy Spirit, He will break out of the boundaries that we set in order to spread. Orthodox believers are always in danger of taking the truth as a doctrinal ordinance for the children of God to keep. This is something we must strictly avoid.</p>
<p>In Acts 14 the church had spread to the Gentiles and was spreading very quickly, but in chapter 15 the spread was interrupted because of the limiting influence of Judaism. The church had an illness that had to be cured in order for it to go on.</p>
<p>Thus, in Acts 15 the apostles who had been going to the Gentiles stopped their work. Instead, they went from Antioch to Jerusalem to cure this illness-to root Judaism out of the church once and for all. Acts 15 was a great surgery. Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, was strong to eliminate the Jewish rituals and ordinances. He said that they should not put the impossible yoke of the Jewish rituals upon the neck of the disciples (v. 10).</p>
<p>Although Paul was an orthodox Jew, he had received revelation from God, and his eyes had been opened. Even the timing of his trip to Jerusalem was according to God&#8217;s revelation. Not long after the meeting in Acts 15, the Roman prince Titus led the Roman army to destroy Jerusalem. The apostle went to Jerusalem around A.D. 50; Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70. There were only about twenty years between these two events.</p>
<p>Spiritually speaking, God had already turned from Judaism, but the outward shell of the Jewish religion existed in the temple and the holy city. The continuation of Judaism in Jerusalem put the church in bondage. Therefore, God spoke through the apostle, saying that it was wrong to remain in Judaism. Then He sent the Roman army to completely destroy the city of Jerusalem and to tear down the temple. This shows that God did not want Jerusalem to serve as a center of authority for the church. God did not want Jerusalem, which was colored by the influence of Judaism, to govern His church.</p>
<p>In the meeting in Acts 15 James was the leader who made the final decision. This role was not given to Peter because he was weak during the work of spreading to the Gentiles. In Galatians 2:11-12, when the brothers came from Jerusalem to Antioch, Peter separated himself from the Gentiles because he was afraid of those of the circumcision. He was weak and did not rise up to keep the church&#8217;s testimony of not differentiating between the Jews and the Gentiles. Because of his weakness in this matter, Peter lost his leading position and was replaced by James.</p>
<p>In Acts 15 Paul spoke the facts about God&#8217;s move among the Gentiles, but it was James who made the decision. James said, based on the truth, that it was not right to harass the Gentile believers and force them to keep the Jewish laws (vv. 19-20). In this matter it was more difficult to speak the truth than to speak the facts. In Acts 15 James was very strong. Although he was deeply influenced by the Jewish religion, under the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit, he shut Judaism out of the church. Thus, at that time James was called a pillar of the church. This shows how delighted the Holy Spirit is with the spread of the church. Everything that limits the spread of the church also limits the building up of God&#8217;s universal church. In this universe God has only one building, which is the church. Therefore, He wants to eliminate all the problems and things in us that frustrate the spread of the church.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord for Acts 15. If this chapter were not in the Bible, we would still be confused about the church. Acts 15 opens the eyes of the church and allows the church to escape the bondage of Judaism and the rule of Jerusalem. Thus, the church can spread freely. Satan wanted to use Judaism and Jerusalem to control, limit, prohibit, and restrict the spread of the church. But God wanted to spread to the Gentiles, to the uttermost part of the earth. God wanted the whole earth to have the testimony of His Son. Paul had this vision. In his Epistle to the Ephesians he wrote that God wanted to make both Gentiles and Jews into the Body of Christ (3:6). Not long after this was written, the Roman army came and destroyed Jerusalem. This was not only a spiritual termination but also a physical termination. We have to believe that this was of God. Everything that God does on the earth is for His church, including the destruction of Jerusalem. God raises up and destroys kings on the earth in coordination with His work of building up the church. Thus, the meeting in Acts 15 dealt with the relationship between the church and Judaism once and for all.</p><h2 class="head2">Human Opinions</h2>
<p>After the problem of the Jewish religion was resolved, Paul and Barnabas immediately went out to the Gentile lands to preach the gospel. The problem of outward religion had been solved, but now they encountered an inward, subjective problem&mdash;Barnabas and Paul could not be in one accord (vv. 35-41). Barnabas wanted to take Mark to visit the brothers, but Paul felt it was not suitable, and an argument arose between them. Their argument was the work of Satan. The spread of the church was greatly damaged because Barnabas and Paul could not be in one accord.</p>
<p>This pattern has been repeated many times in church history. As the church spreads, it first meets outward difficulties. This is the evil plot of the enemy. The spread of the church is the building up of the Body of Christ; if the church does not spread, the Body of Christ cannot be built up and God&rsquo;s eternal plan cannot be completed. The record in Acts shows that Satan follows the Holy Spirit. As the Holy Spirit works to spread and build up the church, Satan follows to damage the Spirit&rsquo;s work of spreading and building up the church. Satan first raises up opposition to the gospel, and then he raises up opposition to the apostles. Nevertheless, the Gentiles received the gospel, and churches were established in Gentile lands.</p>
<p>Next, Satan instigated some from Jerusalem to bring Jewish thought, law, circumcision, and ordinances into the churches in Gentile lands. Despite Satan&rsquo;s attack, the Holy Spirit continued to work. When religious ordinances were limiting the spread of the church, God first sent Paul to Jerusalem and won a victory. Later, He raised up an army to destroy Jerusalem. Not long after this outward problem was resolved, there was a difference of opinion between Barnabas and Paul. When brothers who are co-workers have a difference of opinion, the spread of the church is limited.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say who was right in the contention between Barnabas and Paul, but from that time forth Acts does not record anything regarding Barnabas. This indicates that the responsibility for the error was mainly with Barnabas. Regardless, we should be warned both of problems within and of problems in our environment. Satan works in our environment to damage the spread of the church, and he also works among us to damage the building up of the church.</p>
<p>The contention between Paul and Barnabas weakened the spread of the church. These two apostles, who had been working together, were now separated; Barnabas took Mark and went west to Cyprus, and Paul took Silas and went north to Syria and Cilicia (vv. 39-41). We must read this portion of the Bible very carefully in order to discover the thought of the Holy Spirit. Paul wanted to stay in Asia Minor where he had labored previously, but the Holy Spirit forbade him to remain there (16:6). Paul considered going to Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them (v. 7). For the sake of the spread of the church, the Holy Spirit gave Paul a vision calling him to Europe. After Paul saw the vision, he crossed the sea from Asia Minor to Macedonia (vv. 9-12). Thus, the church spread from Asia Minor to Europe and turned south to the cities of Athens and Corinth (17:15; 18:1).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Old Concepts</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Paul&rsquo;s Old Concepts in His Second Journey</h2>
<p>Acts 16:6-12 indicates that even Paul had problems within. The Holy Spirit wanted him to go out to spread the church, but he did not understand the leading of the Holy Spirit. As he vacillated between going forward or going back, a dream came to him in the night telling him to go to Macedonia in Europe (vv. 9-10). This illustrates a common problem among the Lord&rsquo;s workers. Once workers come to a place for a time and settle down, they do not want to move. At times like these, unwanted circumstances always happen. For example, if I were in charge of my movement, I am afraid I would still be in northern China today. However, God&rsquo;s hand moved me step by step. Old relationships, old affections, and old inclinations keep us from going to another place; they make us unable to move. This is because we do not have any vision. When a worker goes to a place, he tends to become set and settled. This is not an easy problem to solve.</p>
<p>At the end of Acts 15 there is the problem between Barnabas and Paul; in Acts 16 there is a problem within Paul. The spread of the church encounters difficulties at each step. If Paul had not been subdued by the Holy Spirit, the church could not have spread to Europe. We cannot merely read the black and white words of the Bible. When we read Acts 15 through 17, we must look to the Lord for light to see how the church spread. For the church to spread, the bondage of the Jewish religion, human opinions, and the self with its old concepts must be broken.</p>
<p>The spread of the church often encounters these three problems. The first problem is outward, the second is between the workers, and the third comes from the self and old human feelings. The church should have spread to Europe much sooner, but these problems delayed its spread. The final problem in the spread of the church is the self. If we stay in our old feelings and relationships, the spread of the church will be delayed indefinitely. To break out of the self, we need a vision. When we break through, the church spreads. This is true even today.</p>
<p>Dead ordinances, human opinions, and the old feelings of the self stop the Holy Spirit from breaking through and restrict the spread of the church. If the Holy Spirit breaks through these three problems, the church will spread. In the early days, the church spread to Europe and gained a foothold there because the Holy Spirit broke through in these three areas. The Holy Spirit broke through religious regulations and ceremonies, and He broke through dead letters, human opinions, and human feelings. We must look to the Lord for light so that He would have a way in us. Then He will give us ample opportunity to spread His church to distant lands.</p><h2 class="head3">Paul&rsquo;s Old Concepts in His Third Journey</h2>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s old concepts were revealed not only in his second ministry journey but also in his third. When Paul was in Corinth during his third journey, he wrote a letter to the church in Rome and spoke of his feeling to go to Rome to visit the church there and from there to go to Spain (Rom. 1:15; 15:23-24, 28). This feeling is also mentioned in Acts 19:21. This was the will of the Holy Spirit related to the spread of the church. The Holy Spirit revealed to Paul that he should go west for the spread of the church.</p>
<p>On his third trip Paul went to many of the same places in Asia Minor, Macedonia, and Greece. He went back and forth to these few places and then returned to Antioch. Thus, in principle, Paul did not accomplish much for the spread of the church in his third journey. On his return from his third journey, he decided to pass through Macedonia and Achaia on his way to Jerusalem, and from there he would go to Rome. We must know that this was the will of the Holy Spirit. In Jerusalem he encountered some problems and was seized by the Jews (21:27-30).</p>
<p>Macedonia and Achaia were two Roman provinces on the Greek peninsula, in the eastern part of Europe. Further west were the peninsulas of Italy and Spain. The Greek culture was prevailing in the Roman Empire, but the center of the government was in Rome. The strongest influence was in Rome. Thus, Paul had an inward feeling that he should go to Rome. Moreover, Romans 15:23-24 and 28 show that he wanted to go to Spain. The word in Romans 15 and the word in Acts 19:21 were recorded around the same time; Paul felt he should go to Rome, and that after passing through Rome, he should go on to Spain. At that time, Spain was the uttermost part of the earth. If he had reached Spain, Paul would have been to all three major peninsulas in southern Europe.</p>
<p>We cannot lightly pass over these things; we must seriously consider them until we understand. The sense of the Holy Spirit in Paul was related to not merely arriving in Europe but spreading across Europe. Paul definitely had an inward feeling to cross over the Greek peninsula to Rome. Making such a trip would not be so difficult today, but in those days transportation was inconvenient. Consequently, the thought of making such a trip would not be common for Paul; it surely was the work of the Holy Spirit within him.</p>
<p>Before the apostles went to Macedonia, there were no churches there, but there was a church in Rome before Paul came. Many Bible scholars acknowledge that the church in Rome came from the Roman pilgrims in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost. After they believed in the Lord, they returned to Rome and established the church there. Thus, the church in Rome probably began earlier than the churches in Macedonia. In other words, before the apostles came to Europe, there was already a church in Rome. The book of Romans was written by Paul on his third journey while he was in Corinth. At that time, Paul had the feeling that he should formally preach the gospel to the people in Rome. Romans 1:14-15 says that Paul wanted to go there to pay his debt of the gospel to the Gentiles. However, he still went from Corinth back to Jerusalem. On his third journey Paul did not merely fail to spread the churches; he did not carry out the feeling he had concerning the spreading. Whether or not Paul was right to return to Jerusalem, we will not say here, but once the spread of the church falls into human hands, it meets with difficulties. According to Acts 20 through 22, the church in Jerusalem was still in error. When Paul returned to Jerusalem, the believers exhorted him to return to the Jewish religion (21:23-25). Not long after, Paul was arrested while he was in the temple (v. 27). Paul should not have been in the temple; this was his weakness. This mistake was like Peter&rsquo;s weakness in Galatians 2. Paul was sympathetic with the weakness of others and thought that by going to the temple to make some offerings, the problems would pass away. He never thought that by going there, he himself would meet with difficulties.</p>
<p>The Bible records these things to show that in the matter of the church&rsquo;s spread, man and the Holy Spirit are frequently not in coordination with one another. Paul had the feeling to go to Rome and to Spain. He had a burden to go to the Gentiles and to not accommodate the Jewish religion. However, even Paul was weak. The church in Jerusalem in Acts 21 was full of the Jewish thought. In chapter 15 Paul fought a victorious battle for the church and solved the problem of Judaism. However, in chapter 21 he was still influenced to accommodate human weakness.</p>
<p>Our intention is not to condemn Paul but to clearly see the purpose of such a record in the Bible. The will of the Holy Spirit is for the church to continually spread. In Acts 1 the Lord&rsquo;s word is very clear: &ldquo;You shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth&rdquo; (v. 8). This verse shows what the extent of the church&rsquo;s spread should be. However, at every step the Holy Spirit encountered problems with man. On Paul&rsquo;s third journey he was undoubtedly weak; at the very least, it seems that there was not much glory. He should not have gone back; this was a great problem. On the one hand, he wanted to return to Jerusalem, but on the other hand, he had the inward feeling to go to Rome and Spain. Therefore, when Paul went to Jerusalem, it seems that it was not according to the Holy Spirit; rather, it was Paul&rsquo;s own idea.</p>
<p>There are differing views regarding Acts 21 and 22, and there are conflicts concerning their interpretation. Some say that Paul was right; others think that he was wrong. It is difficult to say for certain, but it is certain that the work of the Holy Spirit encountered problems with men. There are many twists in Paul&rsquo;s actions, and these twists are the result of human opinion. In studying church history, we should apply what we learn to ourselves, for today the same problems hinder the spread of the church. James spoke a word to Paul in Acts 21:20: &ldquo;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law.&rdquo; This word shows the extent of the influence of human opinions and viewpoints.</p>
<p>In Romans 15 Paul was clear that he should go to Rome and Spain. In Acts 19 Paul said again that he wanted to go to Rome. His feeling was very much related to the spread of the church, because the next step in spreading to Europe&mdash;after reaching Macedonia and Greece&mdash;was to go to Italy, and specifically to Rome. Then the following step would be to Spain. If the apostle had arrived in Spain, he would have thought that he was at the uttermost part of the earth.</p>
<p>Why, then, did Paul not go west but instead return to Jerusalem? Was his turning back to Jerusalem according to God&rsquo;s revelation? Acts does not record any revelation from the Holy Spirit telling him to go back; rather, it seems that in this move of the apostle there was some weakness. Romans 15:25-28 indicates that Paul went back because he was carrying the offerings from the churches in Macedonia and Greece to the saints in Jerusalem. Even though he said that he was going to Jerusalem and from there to Rome, for him to travel east from Corinth to Jerusalem and then west to Rome would have been very inconvenient.</p>
<p>When Paul wrote the book of Romans, he was full of care for Rome, and the Holy Spirit wanted him to go. However, he was held back by the inward entanglement of his fleshly relationship to the Jews. In Romans 9:3 Paul said, &ldquo;I could wish that I myself were a curse, separated from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.&rdquo; Perhaps his trip to Jerusalem was for his kinsmen according to the flesh. In other words, he had not entirely abandoned his Jewish concepts.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Paul was taking offerings to Jerusalem, he was seized soon afterward. This indicates that the offerings need not have been taken or distributed by him personally. In returning to Jerusalem, Paul took a step backward. It was not the way to Rome, where he really felt that he should be. Was there truly a need in the work for him to go to Jerusalem? We cannot see such a need for it in the Bible. The responsibility for the work in Judea had been entrusted to another group of apostles from the beginning. Paul&rsquo;s ministry was to the Gentiles. As an apostle to the Gentiles, he went backward, returning to his own country on behalf of his kinsmen according to the flesh. Humanly speaking this may be praiseworthy, but in the eyes of God it was absolutely not acceptable.</p>
<p>Paul wanted to arrive in Jerusalem before Pentecost (Acts 20:16), a Jewish feast. At Pentecost all the Jewish males had to go to Jerusalem to keep the feast; this was a very important feast. This feast was representative of Judaism. Although Paul was not going to Jerusalem to keep the feast, perhaps he wanted to use the feast as an opportunity to distribute the offerings to the believers from many places who would be in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>If this was the case, it shows that many Jewish believers of that time were still in the Jewish religion. Paul should have argued with them, telling them that it was wrong for Jewish believers to keep the Jewish ordinances, whether they lived in Gentile lands or in Jerusalem. Regardless of where they lived, none of them should have kept the Jewish ordinances. This is not a small matter. In any event, Paul had some weakness at that time. He should have rejected the environment of Pentecost, but he did not. The portion beginning in Acts 21:20 completely exposes his weakness.</p>
<p>At that time, the Jewish believers were in the temple making vows and offering sacrifices. With James and all the elders present (v. 18), Paul was persuaded to participate in things that he had condemned in the book of Galatians. Paul taught people not to keep the law, but he pretended to keep it in front of others. From Acts 21 the work of spreading the church met with difficulty from the old, nationalistic concepts of men.</p>
<p>After the conference in Jerusalem in Acts 15, it seemed as if the church had settled things once and for all concerning the matter of Judaism, but in chapter 21 the church opened a back door to again accept Judaism. The Jewish believers were still keeping the law; in the morning perhaps they prayed by virtue of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood, but in the afternoon they could still offer up sacrifices of bulls and rams. They wanted both Christ and the law. They wanted the Spirit and the ordinances.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, it was wrong for Paul to go to Jerusalem. We dare not say that it was a sin, but it was certainly a weakness. If Paul had not been seized at that time, his offering of sacrifices would have confused the Gentile brothers when they heard about it. The line between the Old and New Testament dispensations, between the law and grace, would have been blurred. Therefore, it was certainly wrong for Paul to go back there.</p>
<p>Paul felt bound in his spirit before this matter (20:22). Positively speaking, he knew in his spirit what would happen to him when he went ahead. In 21:11 the Holy Spirit warned him through Agabus&rsquo;s prophecy not to proceed. However, Paul did not listen to the warning. Even when the saints pleaded with him, he did not listen (vv. 4, 12). This was an independent action. In this instance Paul went against his own feeling and the feeling of the Body. He ignored the warning from the Holy Spirit, and he did not receive the exhortations of the saints. This was wrong. The Holy Spirit told him to go west, but he turned and went east. For the sake of his kinsmen according to the flesh, he was willing to be cut off from Christ, Rome, and Spain (Rom. 9:3). This was because of Paul&rsquo;s old, human concept.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s return to Jerusalem went against five instances of feeling and teaching concerning the matter. First, the Holy Spirit gave him a positive feeling, but he did not obey it. Second, the Holy Spirit gave him a restricting feeling, but again he did not listen. In every move, if we do not feel the flow, there is a problem with what we are doing. Third, Agabus gave him a prophetic warning, but Paul did not listen. Fourth, he went against the feeling of the Body. Fifth, he went against the clear word of the Lord&rsquo;s teaching. The Lord said that if there is persecution in one city, we should leave it and flee to another city (Matt. 10:23). Paul did not need to return to Jerusalem, he did not have any great purpose in going there, and there were sufferings awaiting him there. His insistence on going was related entirely to his old, natural concepts.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT&rsquo;S WAY OF<br />
BREAKING THROUGH THE PROBLEMS</h2>
<p>After Paul returned to Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit came in to discipline him. On the seventh day, just as Paul was about to complete his vow, some Jews came to the temple and seized him (Acts 21:26-27). Not long after this incident&mdash;perhaps ten years later&mdash;the Roman prince Titus led an army to destroy the temple. It has not been rebuilt to this day. If Titus had not destroyed the temple, the church would have been mixed with the Jewish religion. Thank God that He did not allow His children to go back to the Old Testament, nor did He allow the church to be mixed with Judaism. He completely destroyed the influence of the Jewish religion in the church.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul returned to Jerusalem to accommodate the Jews, but instead he was imprisoned. Jerusalem, which promoted returning to Judaism, was thoroughly torn down. From the time of its destruction, the Bible does not record anything concerning Jerusalem, nor is it given much position in church history. In God&rsquo;s eyes Jerusalem was a place that damaged grace and covered up the light; therefore, both the city and its temple had to be torn down in order to break through the problems and obstacles.</p>
<p>After his weakness in accommodating Judaism led to his arrest, Paul had to use his wisdom in his interrogation by the Sanhedrin. First, he discussed the matter of resurrection before the Pharisees and the Sadducees (23:6-8). Paul set the Pharisees against the Saducees by saying to them loudly, &ldquo;Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!&rdquo; (v. 6). The orthodox Jews immediately took Paul&rsquo;s side, and began to argue with the Sadducees, who did not believe that there is a resurrection. This was Paul&rsquo;s wisdom. Next he appealed to Caesar (25:11). Paul&rsquo;s original feeling was that he needed to go to Rome. The Holy Spirit confirmed this by revealing to him that he would testify for the Lord in Rome (23:11). Ultimately, Paul did go to Rome, but not in a way of convenience. He could have gone to Rome in freedom; now he came in a different way. He even might have done more while in Rome, but from this time onward, Paul&rsquo;s movements were greatly restricted.</p>
<p>In spite of the inconvenience of his imprisonment, Paul learned a deep lesson and wrote many precious Epistles while in prison. We cannot deny this. Nonetheless, Paul&rsquo;s return to Jerusalem was a hindrance to the spread of the church. It is always a problem and a frustration when we go in circles rather than a straight line. Paul should have gone straight to Rome from Corinth, but the elements of oldness within him and his attachments to the ordinances became an entanglement to him, causing him to go backward to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Between Paul&rsquo;s trip to Jerusalem in Acts 15 and his trip in Acts 21, he wrote the book of Galatians. In Galatians he had depreciated the Jewish law to the uttermost. Although he had said that he could be all things to all men (1 Cor. 9:20-22), in Acts 21 he was too much in his accommodation of Jewish traditions. In reality, one cannot be all things to all people; if someone worships idols and we follow him in his idol worship, we have gone too far. It is absolutely wrong to do such a thing. When Paul taught the Gentile churches, he explained the revelation he had received very clearly&mdash;the law is over, so we need not tolerate Jewish things. In order to be a Jew to the Jews, he could have done a few things, and it would have been enough. He did not need to make a vow or offer sacrifices. His practice in this case was against his revelation and against the teachings he had given to the churches; what he did was too much.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother goes for a walk with his friend, and when they reach the door of a movie theater his friend wants to go in and see a movie. The brother should tell his friend that he cannot go in with him and let him go in alone. When some friends are playing mah-jongg, we cannot sit with them. We cannot be all things to all people. Paul was weak when he was in Jerusalem because he was not in the Holy Spirit; the Holy Spirit was not with him. We cannot be strong in ourselves. When we follow the leading of the Holy Spirit, we have His presence and can spontaneously be strong. But without His presence, we are all weak.</p>
<p>Although the Holy Spirit disciplined Paul, God still sent him to Rome. Because Paul was always in the hand of the Lord, the Holy Spirit could use His disciplining hand to send him to Rome. When Paul arrived in Rome, he was limited in many ways according to God&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p>
<p>Acts chapters 16 through 28 all speak of the church&rsquo;s spreading in Europe. The biggest and most frustrating problem in this section is the Jewish religion. In the beginning the problem was Judaism, and at the end this problem was still there. The problem of Judaism was considered at the conference in Jerusalem in Acts 15, but it was not completely resolved. Only when God stretched out His hand to destroy the temple in Jerusalem was this problem solved. Once the problem of Judaism was cleared up, the church was set free. The church was like a chick coming out of the eggshell of Judaism. When God stretched forth His hand to destroy Jerusalem and the temple, the eggshell was completely cast aside. From then on, the church could spread in freedom.</p>
<p>According to Acts 21, the church in Jerusalem was steeped in Judaism. The brothers in Jerusalem told Paul that there were tens of thousands of believers, all zealous for the law (v. 20). The fact that many among them still made vows shows that they were zealous both for the spirit of the law and the ordinances of the law (v. 23). They even went to the temple to worship God and to ask the Jewish priests to offer sacrifices for them (v. 26). This shows that there was no separation between the believers in Jerusalem and Judaism; they had returned to the Jewish religion. Not only did they practice elements of Judaism, they also exhorted Paul to do the same. They even made these elements into a doctrine with which they taught Paul. When the brothers exhorted Paul, they did it before James and all the elders (v. 18). Yet no one stood up to protest. All the elders gave their silent approval to this matter.</p>
<p>Clearly, the church in Jerusalem had fallen into Judaism. The earthly Jerusalem is not trustworthy; only the heavenly Jerusalem can be trusted. Thus, from this time onward the Bible does not mention the church in Jerusalem. Even in church history, Jerusalem has no position. This shows that deadened Judaism and old human concepts are great frustrations to the spread of the church.</p>
<p>The old creation and the old ordinances within us hinder the spread of the church. Outward persecution and troubles cannot stop the church&rsquo;s spread; instead, they help. However, old relationships, ordinances, methods, and even truths become entanglements to servants of the Lord and hinder the spread of the church. Even though we have a sense within and a burden, the church often cannot spread because of our weakness.</p>
<p>Over the past two thousand years, if the servants of the Lord had always allowed the Holy Spirit to go forward, the church would have matured long ago. If all of us move in a straight line without going in circles, the churches would multiply and be built up in every part of Taiwan. If the Holy Spirit has a straight way in us, the spread of the church would not be limited by us in any way. Any sympathy for human relationships and old ordinances will frustrate the spread of the church. May the Lord have mercy on us. Whoever receives mercy from the Lord will be saved in these matters. The degree to which we are saved is the degree to which the church can spread and be built up.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>The Bible records the spread of the church through Acts 28. The Bible also records many other matters, including the desolation of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR LINES CONCERNING THE CHURCH<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>In the New Testament there are four lines concerning the church. The first line is the meaning of the church or the spiritual aspect of the church. The second line is the course of the church, the third line is the organization of the church, and the fourth line is the desolation of the church. The desolation of the church is part of the course of the church. The word <em>desolation</em> indicates that something has happened to cause a problem. In the course of the church a very serious thing happened&mdash;the church was corrupted. The church had a change resulting in a problem. Therefore, if we want to know the situation of the church, we must know about the desolation of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECORD OF<br />
THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Lying to the Holy Spirit and Quarreling</h2>
<p>According to the record in the New Testament, the desolation of the church began in Acts 5:1-11 when Ananias and Sapphira lied to the Holy Spirit. Then in Acts 6:1-6 some of the saints murmured concerning the dispensing of food. These two portions show the beginning of the problems in the church. However, at this point the church as a whole was not in desolation and failure since these matters involved only a few people and the problems were not very serious.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Divisions</h2>
<p>The first indication of the true desolation of the church is in 1 Corinthians. At that time there were already divisions in the church. Some of the Corinthian believers said that they were of Paul, and others said that they were of Apollos, Cephas, and Christ (1:11-12; 3:3-4). This shows that the Corinthian believers were very fleshly and that there were strifes among them. This was the beginning of the church&rsquo;s desolation and abnormality. Moreover, the Corinthian believers were critical of the apostle Paul, who took the lead and built up the church among them. Second Corinthians 12:16-18 indicates that they even accused Paul of taking advantage of them by guile. The problems in the church in Corinth were much more serious than Ananias and Sapphira lying to the Holy Spirit or the saints murmuring about the daily dispensing of food. Thus, we can say that the record of the actual degradation of the church begins in 1 Corinthians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">False Apostles</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians the problems in the church in Corinth included not only divisions among the saints but also some who pretended to be apostles and criticized, opposed, and condemned the true apostle, Paul. In 2 Corinthians 11:13 Paul says, &ldquo;Such ones are false apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ.&rdquo; Paul was forced to boast, saying, &ldquo;I count myself to be inferior to the super-apostles in nothing...Ministers of Christ are they? I speak as being beside myself, I more so!&rdquo; (vv. 5, 23). This shows that the atmosphere in the church at that time was already improper. Paul had to speak unpleasant words of rebuke and condemnation. We see that the church had a problem; therefore, by 2 Corinthians the church had become degraded. The degraded condition was not only among the saints with their divisions; there also were problems in the relationship between the apostles and the saints, and there were false apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Continuation of Desolation</h2>
<p>In principle, the condition of the church today is no different from the condition of the early church. There were problems in the early church, and there are the same problems in the church today. There are inappropriate things in the church today that were also present in the early days. For example, such things as division, criticism and lack of submission to the apostles, and strifes, pretensions, and falsehood among the Lord&rsquo;s servants are still present in the church.</p>
<p>The desolation of the church, which began in the church in Corinth, has continued throughout the past two thousand years. If we consider Taipei, we see that in only one section of the city there are more than ten different chapels for church meetings. This area can be called a &ldquo;chapel district.&rdquo; These chapels represent different sects, and there is no unity among them. This shows that the church has not been able to escape the condition of Corinth. We should apply the Epistles to the church in Corinth to ourselves. All the problems encountered in Corinth persist today. When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians in approximately A.D. 59, only a little more than twenty years after the church was produced on the day of Pentecost, its condition was already abnormal.</p><h2 class="head2">Fierce Wolves Entering the Flock</h2>
<p>In Acts 20, as Paul traveled to Jerusalem on his return from his third journey, he passed through Ephesus. He spoke prophetically when he said to the elders in Ephesus, &ldquo;After my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. And from among you yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverted things to draw away the disciples after them&rdquo; (vv. 29-30). The apostle sensed within his spirit that corruption would enter the church. We should not despise the apostle&rsquo;s word that fierce wolves will enter the flock. Fierce wolves coming in among a flock of sheep is a serious problem. In Galatians 2:11-14 there was a small problem with Peter, but he was not a fierce wolf coming in among the flock. Peter was more like a slightly sick sheep. However, Paul said that fierce wolves would come into the church in Ephesus; these were false, evil men who came into the church speaking heresy and leading people astray. This is a serious matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching Christ Because of Envy and Strife</h2>
<p>At the time the book of Philippians was written, the desolation of the church had become more serious. In 1:15, Paul says, &ldquo;Some preach Christ even because of envy and strife.&rdquo; This shows that some people even preached the gospel because of envy and strife. They preached the gospel in this way in order to oppose the apostle Paul. Thus, when Paul wrote the book of Philippians from a Roman prison, the church was in chaos. In the age of the apostles there were those who did gospel work out of envy and strife.</p>
<p>In 1934 the Japanese imprisoned and interrogated me, but they could not charge me with any crime. One day they brought me out of my cell and asked me why people in Christianity had nothing good to say about me. I carefully considered how to answer because my interrogator was an unbeliever and also one of the invading Japanese. I could not speak poorly of my fellow Chinese. Moreover, even those who had nothing good to say about me were members of the church of God, and I could not speak negatively about the church to an unbeliever. It was a difficult question, and if I did not give a good answer, it would create trouble. I had to follow the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 10:18-20, not trusting in myself before officials but relying completely on the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit within gave me the words to speak, and I said, &ldquo;Those who are in the same line of business are usually envious one of another. If you and I both sold cloth, then I would hope that you would go out of business so that my business would prosper. This is why the Chinese have a proverb which speaks of people in the same line of business being enemies.&rdquo; My Japanese interrogator immediately laughed and expressed his agreement.</p>
<p>I did not say that others were wrong or that I was right. I only said that they had nothing good to say about me because of envy, that is, because people in the same line of business are enemies. If my business fails, all the people in my line of business will love and pity me; however, if my business is successful, my competitors will hate me. Although this scenario does not sound pleasant, it has been happening for two thousand years. Even in Philippians 1 there was such a degraded situation in the church.</p>
<p>First Timothy does not speak much about the desolation of the church, but 2 Timothy is almost entirely on this subject. J. N. Darby once said that the &ldquo;second&rdquo; books in the New Testament are all on the desolation of the church. This is the case with 2 Corinthians, 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, and 2 and 3 John. Even the Epistle to the church in Ephesus in Revelation 2:1-7 is a kind of &ldquo;2 Ephesians.&rdquo; Darby thought that all the &ldquo;second&rdquo; books concerned the desolation of the church. Although this is not strictly accurate, it is still quite reasonable. Among the Epistles that touch the desolation of the church, the &ldquo;second&rdquo; books have much more to say than the &ldquo;first&rdquo; books.</p><h2 class="head2">Teaching Heretical Doctrines and<br />
Going against the Teaching of the Apostles</h2>
<p>In 2 Timothy the desolation of the church reached an extreme level. Some people taught heresy and blatantly opposed the teaching of the apostles. Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to the apostle Paul (4:14). Hymenaeus and Philetus said that the resurrection had already taken place and overthrew the faith of some (2:17-18), and their words spread like gangrene. All in Asia seemed to forsake the apostle&rsquo;s teachings and turned away from him (1:15). Even Paul&rsquo;s former co-worker Demas abandoned Paul, because he loved the present age (4:10). When Paul stood trial in Rome, no one stood with him (vv. 16-17). This was the situation in approximately A.D. 67, only about thirty years after the producing of the church in Jerusalem. Although Paul had been an apostle for a little more than twenty years, the church was corrupted to such an extent.</p>
<p>In 2 Peter the church was in desolation because of the preaching of heretical doctrines (2:1). False teachers made heresies into doctrines and preached them to others. In speaking of heresies, 2:1 mentions the problem of the false teachers, and verse 15 mentions the problem of Balaam. Peter&rsquo;s description shows that the church was full of heretical teachings. Jude 4-19 also speaks of the desolation. Jude says in verse 24 that God is able to guard us in the midst of the desolation, but the desolation he describes is the same as that in 2 Peter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Confessing That Christ Came in the Flesh</h2>
<p>First John 2:18-19 says that some went out from among the apostles, leaving the fellowship of the apostles. This proves that the church was degraded at that time. Second John 9-11 says even more clearly that the believers must not receive certain so-called church workers. The believers were not only to refrain from receiving these workers, they were not even supposed to greet them, because they went beyond the teachings of Christ. Although they worked in the church, they were antichrists; they went beyond the teachings of Christ and taught in opposition to Christ&rsquo;s redemption and salvation. They did not confess that Jesus Christ was God manifested in the flesh. Their biggest problem was denying the Person of Christ by not confessing that the Lord came in the flesh (1 John 4:3). This is similar to modernists who say that the Lord Jesus was a man but do not confess that He is God. The apostle John calls this kind of person an antichrist (2 John 7). An antichrist&rsquo;s teachings are unrelated to Christ and even oppose Christ. This shows that the desolation of the church was very serious at that time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Idolatry and Fornication</h2>
<p>The seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 were dictated by the Lord to the apostle John. Each of the seven epistles speaks of the desolation of the church. Although the second epistle, addressed to the church in Smyrna, and the sixth epistle, addressed to the church in Philadelphia, do not mention the desolation of the church in these particular localities, they still indicate that the church was in desolation. The other epistles, especially the one to the church in Thyatira, show that the church was degraded to the uttermost. The church in Thyatira committed the two greatest sins, idolatry and fornication. Man&rsquo;s greatest sin before God is idolatry, and the greatest sin among men is fornication. These two gross sins both existed in the degraded church.</p>
<p>In the last epistle to the church in Laodicea, the Lord is no longer within the church. Rather, He is standing outside the door. The Lord is standing outside the door of the church in Laodicea.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESOLATE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH TODAY</h2>
<p>A basic principle is that every word in the Bible regarding the desolation of the church requires all two thousand years of church history for its exposition. Anything in the Bible concerning the desolation of the church, even a brief reference, needs all of church history for its explanation. For example, <em>divisions</em> is a very simple word in 1 Corinthians 1:10, but this simple word can be fully described only through all the events of church history. Idolatry is another great matter in church history.</p>
<p>In 1940 in Shanghai, the brothers took me to a Russian Orthodox church. It was very similar to a Roman Catholic church. Inside the doorway there was a table where candles were sold, just as in an idol temple. Worshippers first bought a candle, which they lit before entering further. There were many icons of Peter and Paul in the chapel. The people would find an icon and bow before it, then place their candle in front of it and kneel. This was identical to the practice of Chinese idol worshippers in the idol temples. When we asked them who they were worshipping, they said they were worshipping the fathers, but before them would be a picture of Peter. We could not take this; there was no difference between this and the Chinese idol temples. Later, we went to the &ldquo;Black Nazarene&rdquo; church in Manila and saw the worshippers there. It is difficult to describe such superstition. The statue of Peter in Saint Peter&rsquo;s Basilica in Rome has been kissed so much by worshippers that one of its feet has been worn away. These examples show the extent of the idolatry in the degraded church.</p>
<p>After Constantine, the church was corrupted by idolatry. The bones of the so-called saints were sold to superstitious people; this was a lucrative business. People worshipped the bones because of their superstition. More and more bones were sold, and many were fakes. The problem of money is also present in the desolation of the church. Some people make preaching the word into a profession or make godliness a means of gain (1 Tim. 6:5). In addition, in the history of the church there are many cases of heresy. If we consider the portions concerning the desolation of the church from 2 Corinthians, Philippians, 2 Timothy, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, and the epistles in Revelation, we will see that the matters that the Bible records as part of the desolation of the early church are still present in the church today.</p>
<p>The worst titles that the Lord gives to the church are &ldquo;great harlot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Babylon the Great&rdquo; (Rev. 17:1-5). <em>Babylon</em> in Greek is equivalent to <em>Babel</em> in the Old Testament. Both words refer to confusion and fornication. Today the so-called churches in Christianity are Babylon. The final titles for the church in the Bible are also feminine: &ldquo;bride&rdquo; and &ldquo;New Jerusalem&rdquo; (21:2). The New Jerusalem is pure, not confused and not mixed.</p>
<p>As children of God, we can easily discern between Babylon and the New Jerusalem in our speaking; however, it is difficult to make this distinction in the age in which we live. Some things belong to Babylon, but we think they are of the New Jerusalem; some things are mixed, but we think they are pure; some things have changed in nature, but we think they are as they were in the beginning. In the church today many people think that the improper, desolate situation of the church is its normal condition.</p>
<p>In speaking of the course of the church, we need to realize that every item of the desolation mentioned in the Bible has been fulfilled in the history of the church. May God have mercy on us that our eyes would be opened to see what things in the church are of Babylon and what things are of the New Jerusalem, to see what things should be in the church and what things should not. We must have the ability to discern these matters.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />
DURING THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>As those who live during the desolation of the church, we need to realize that the desolation manifests our condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DESOLATION MANIFESTING EACH ONE&rsquo;S CONDITION</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 11:19 says, &ldquo;For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.&rdquo; <em>Those who are approved</em> can also be translated &ldquo;those who are approved by testing.&rdquo; This means that when there are parties in the church, those whom God approves are manifested. During the desolation of the church, the different kinds of confusion, errors, and corruption function to manifest the ones approved by God. Whoever passes through the tests and is approved by God will be manifested through the desolation.</p>
<p>God does not desire the desolation, but in His hand it functions to manifest those who can pass the tests. Without desolation, confusion, errors, corruption, and darkness, we would not be able to see each individual&rsquo;s condition. In other words, during a time of peace and security, we cannot tell whom God approves and who passes the test. However, when situations of desolation arise, our condition is manifested. We are manifested with respect to what kind of person we are, including our situation before the Lord, the lessons we have learned, and our motives. These matters cannot remain hidden. Desolation tests us and manifests what we are before the Lord.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord that at present in Taiwan we do not have contentions among us; however, no one can guarantee that in six months or a year the church will still be without some desolation. When there is desolation, our real situation will be manifested. Desolation exposes people; corrupt things expose people. When the church is peaceful and secure, everyone is the same; we do not feel that we are any different from others. But when desolation comes in, our situation cannot be hidden, and all things are manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />
DURING A PERIOD OF DESOLATION</h2>
<p>In facing the desolation of the church, we should ask ourselves, &ldquo;Where do I stand? Is my intention proper? Is my motive pure? Is there any area in which I am disobedient to God? Have I been dealt with by God to a sufficient extent?&rdquo; If our inward condition is improper, we will be unable to control ourselves when desolation comes.</p>
<p>In 1942 there was a storm in the church in Shanghai. I was not there and did not understand the real situation. Later, I went to Shanghai, and gradually I learned what had happened. Very few brothers and sisters stood firm during that storm; only a handful passed through the storm and were approved by God. The storm manifested the real condition of their hearts and fulfilled the word in 1 Corinthians 11:19. The storm was like a flood, sweeping away many and leaving only a small number who passed the test and were approved by God. Desolation has its usefulness, but we should be careful when desolation comes, because it will expose us. When desolation or corruption comes into the church, it is a test to all of us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Holding a Good Conscience</h2>
<p>First Timothy 1:19-20 says, &ldquo;Holding...a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith; of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander.&rdquo; The books of 1 and 2 Timothy contain the most practical speaking in all the Bible regarding the conscience. In both 1 and 2 Timothy Paul emphasizes the conscience because it is very much related to the desolation of the church. When the church is in desolation, those who follow the Lord and live before Him must hold a good conscience. Paul commands Timothy to &ldquo;war the good warfare&rdquo; of the faith (1 Tim. 1:18) and to &ldquo;guard the good deposit&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:13-14). However, Paul&rsquo;s commands to Timothy concerning holding a good conscience are stronger than his words concerning holding the faith.</p>
<p>In a sense, the main reason the church became desolate was because of problems in people&rsquo;s conscience. Some deviated from the faith, and some spoke differently from the apostles, because they did not care for the feeling in their conscience. If we consider carefully we will realize that all the confusion in the church comes from people quenching and ignoring the feeling of the conscience. A person may hold the faith and yet have a problem in his conscience. However, he cannot hold a good conscience without holding the faith, because if he does not hold the faith, his conscience will condemn him. During the desolation of the church, the opinions, ideas, and assertions of others cannot be our guide; the speaking of our conscience within us is our guide. In order to hold a good conscience, we must avoid doing anything that causes the conscience to lose its peace. We do not need to argue about whether or not our conscience is good.</p>
<p>When I was in northern China, some people rebuked me, saying that I was causing trouble in Christianity, and they carelessly made false accusations against me. I did not argue with them. I only said, &ldquo;I have peace in my conscience. May you, too, have peace in your conscience.&rdquo; Many times when I spoke in this way, their expressions would change, and they would be unable to speak. What we say does not mean anything; the conscience is our standard. If we are at peace in our heart, everything is all right. During the desolation of the church, the function of the conscience is crucial, just as lights are crucial in a time of darkness. Once some people fiercely rebuked Brother Nee. He said softly, &ldquo;You have One within you who is speaking on my behalf.&rdquo; This influenced me greatly.</p>
<p>Excuses, debates, and arguments are useless; the conscience is our standard. Therefore, we should not reason with others or with ourselves. Rather, we should simply check whether our conscience is at peace. In all things we need to ask ourselves about our conscience; only the voice of our conscience can be our standard. When people rebuke us, we do not need to argue with them. In the midst of outward difficulties we should seek inward peace.</p>
<p>When God first touches us, He touches our conscience. This is both the beginning and the foundation. Regardless of how deep or high our experience of the Lord is, the conscience is still the primary part. One of the main factors in the desolation of the church is that the brothers and sisters have problems with their conscience. Because they did not care for the sense in their conscience, some veered off from the faith, and others opposed the apostles. To deal with desolation, we must deal with our conscience. Once our conscience has been dealt with, the desolation is almost behind us.</p>
<p>Consider the example of baptism. When the church is in a proper condition, there is only one teaching regarding baptism. However, when the church is in desolation, there are many questions. Someone may ask, &ldquo;Should I be baptized? How should I be baptized?&rdquo; These are typical questions. We do not need to argue; we can simply say, &ldquo;Whatever you have the peace in your heart to do is fine. Do whatever you have the peace to do.&rdquo; This will touch his conscience. Once a brother told me that he had the peace not to be baptized. I answered, &ldquo;Fine. Then do not be baptized.&rdquo; The next day he came to me again because he had no inward peace. He admitted that he was wrong and asked to be baptized. It is more effective to touch someone&rsquo;s conscience than to speak ten messages to him. As Christians, we must act in a way that takes care of the peace within. It is useless to argue about doctrines with people; rather, we should touch the feeling in their conscience.</p>
<p>If God has not touched our conscience, we will be unable to touch someone else&rsquo;s conscience. Because the Lord Jesus had a pure conscience, He could touch other people&rsquo;s conscience. If His conscience had condemned Him, He could not have said to the crowd in John 8:7, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.&rdquo; Because His word touched their conscience, they walked away one by one, from the oldest to the youngest. The Lord touched their conscience, because His conscience was pure. My intention is not to show how to deal with others during the desolation; I am begging the Lord that we would see a principle that we can apply to ourselves. During the desolation of the church, there are many different interpretations and arguments. If we follow a certain interpretation, we will be shaken; if we follow a certain argument, we will be confused. The standard is our conscience.</p>
<p>First John 3:21 says, &ldquo;If our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.&rdquo; This word was spoken during the desolation of the church. In some things God condemns us according to the feeling of our conscience. We may be wrong in certain matters, but if our conscience has no feeling, our responsibility toward God in these matters is not as great. However, God will not be loose concerning any matter that He has shined on and touched in our conscience. We must bear responsibility before God for these things. If we have received mercy from God, we can say, &ldquo;Other people may do this, but I cannot.&rdquo; Other people may have the peace to do something, but God prohibits us from doing it. It does not matter whether it is right or wrong; rather, it is a matter of whether or not our conscience allows us to do it.</p>
<p>Some have asked me if it is right to advertise our gospel meetings as some groups do, using newspaper advertisements to promote a professor or world-famous evangelist. The question should not be whether this is right, but whether our conscience is at peace. We do not criticize others, because they are responsible for their actions before the Lord, just as we are responsible for our actions before the Lord. They may not be condemned in this matter because their conscience has no feeling about it. However, if we have a feeling, then we are responsible. Thus, there is no outward regulation or standard. In the desolation of the church, everything depends on whether our conscience is pure before God. We must do our best to keep this principle.</p>
<p>The conscience is the key. While the church is in desolation, we must learn the lesson of the conscience. Then we will avoid many arguments and criticisms. We should never place doctrines and teachings before others, telling them what they should or should not do. When the church was in extreme desolation, Paul wrote to Timothy, but he did not tell Timothy what to do. He did not require Timothy to adhere to regulations and doctrines but asked him to hold a good conscience. If we practice this and lead others in this way, then we will learn not to criticize others or to override their conscience.</p>
<p>If a brother&rsquo;s way of bringing people to salvation causes us to lose peace, we should not criticize him. We should allow his conscience to bear the responsibility before God. If we speak something to him, it should not be in the way of criticism. We should only testify regarding the Lord&rsquo;s care for us. If the Lord touches and enlightens his conscience through our testimony, it is enough. In the midst of the desolation of the church we should hold a good conscience and should not override the conscience of others. We should not speak doctrines to others, nor should we make excuses for ourselves.</p><h2 class="head2">Cleansed from Dishonorable Vessels</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Gold, Silver, Wood, and Earth<br />
Being a Matter of Nature</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 2:20-21 says, &ldquo;In a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen; and some are unto honor, and some unto dishonor. If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work.&rdquo; In the preceding verses Paul speaks of those who preach heresies and damage the work of God, like Hymenaeus and Philetus (v. 17). He refers to these people as vessels. Thus, even modernists who preach heresy are vessels in the great house. However, they are wooden and earthen vessels. <em>Wooden</em> refers to the fallen human nature, the flesh, and the natural man; <em>earthen</em> means &ldquo;of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The modernists in today&rsquo;s Christianity preach Christ, but they do not believe that Christ came in the flesh; they are wooden and earthen vessels. <em>Wooden and earthen vessels</em> refers to false believers who are not truly saved. Because God is great, His house is a great house. In His great house there are vessels of gold (those who are divine), vessels of silver (those who are redeemed), and wooden and earthen vessels (those who are constituted with the fallen human nature). We were all earthen vessels, but we have been redeemed and have had a change in nature inwardly to become vessels of silver and gold.</p>
<p>The church today is in desolation and has become a great tree (Matt. 13:32). In this great tree, that is, in Christianity, there are all kinds of preachers and workers, such as Paul, Timothy, Hymenaeus, and Philetus. In the desolation of the church, the Lord wants us to cleanse ourselves from dishonorable vessels, from those who are fleshly, worldly, and natural. The Lord wants us to become vessels unto honor. Although we should not argue with people about doctrines, we need to discern their nature. We should discern whether the nature of someone&rsquo;s work is wooden and earthen or if it is gold and silver. Is it a work of wood and earth or a work of gold and silver? Some people build with wood, grass, and stubble; others build with gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12). We must discern the nature of the work.</p>
<p>Doctrine and nature are two separate issues; we must be able to discern both. Suppose, for example, that two brothers speak the same gospel message, but their ways are different. We should decide which one to follow, not based on the doctrine they preach but based on the way and result of their work. We must base our decision on the nature of their work. Are they building with wood, grass, and stubble or with gold, silver, and precious stones? Is the nature of their work earthen and wooden or gold and silver? When we consider this, we will see who is working according to the flesh with a worldly method. The result of such a work will be earthen, or worldly, and wooden, that is, full of the human &ldquo;flavor.&rdquo; We need to discern the &ldquo;flavor,&rdquo; the nature. We cannot consider doctrine only; our consideration must also be based on the nature of the work. We must discern if its nature is of God. Does it contain the element of the cross, the silver of redemption, and the golden, divine element? We must also discern whether it is human, natural, and full of the element of the world.</p>
<p>In the desolation of the church, many people teach the doctrine of overcoming. However, if we make decisions based on doctrine, we will be blind and unable to obtain the blessing. With respect to ourselves, we need to care for our conscience; with respect to others, we must discern their nature. Second Timothy shows that in the desolation there are workers with different natures who use methods with different natures that produce results with different natures. Some are honorable and some are dishonorable. If we do not experience God&rsquo;s transforming work, we will not have the golden, divine nature operating within us or the dealing of the cross&rsquo;s redemption. Rather, we will merely be wooden and earthen, that is, dishonorable. If we cleanse ourselves from dishonorable vessels, we will be vessels unto honor.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Cleansed from Others<br />
Because of the Difference in Nature</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 2:21 says, &ldquo;If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor.&rdquo; <em>These</em> refers to vessels &ldquo;unto dishonor&rdquo; (v. 20). Cleansing ourselves from dishonorable vessels does not mean that we separate ourselves from those with whom we cannot have mutual understanding on doctrine. Rather, it means that once we recognize the wooden and earthen nature of dishonorable vessels, we stay away from them. We may not like the phrase <em>cleanses himself from,</em> because when we cleanse ourselves from people, we must stay away from them. However, <em>cleanses himself from</em> is the command of the Holy Spirit. Of course, keeping the oneness is also the command of the Holy Spirit, but keeping the oneness applies only to those who have the same nature that we have; we must cleanse ourselves from those of a different nature.</p>
<p>We can discern the nature of others only to the extent to which we have been transformed by the divine life. The more we are transformed, the more we will be able to see the nature of others. If we are not transformed by the divine life and have not passed through the dealing of the cross, we will not be able to discern the true nature of things, even when we touch earth and wood. Some people speak of oneness and tell others not to be divisive, but the real oneness is in the golden life and the silver redemption. The New Jerusalem is not of earth or wood; it is of pure gold.</p>
<p>God never tolerates mixture. The heavenly things are heavenly, and the earthly things are earthly. God does not mix gold and silver with wood and earth. Two kinds of seeds should not be sown together in one place, two kinds of material should not be woven into one garment, and two kinds of animals should not be bred together (Lev. 19:19). We must cleanse ourselves from dishonorable and earthly persons but not because of differences in doctrine. We should stay away from them because of a difference in nature. In the desolation of the church there are different kinds of workers with different kinds of natures and methods. If we do not allow God to work in us, we will be unable to discern the nature of the workers, because we will be the same in nature. Therefore, we must allow God to work in us and deal with us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PROPER ATTITUDE<br />
DURING THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">Praying out of a Pure Heart</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 2:22 says, &ldquo;Pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; During the desolation of the church, only those with a pure heart can find the way. In the desolation of the church many people cannot find the way because their heart is impure, and they are unable to discern the nature of things.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Pure Heart Being a Matter of Motive</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that in touching someone&rsquo;s work, we must discern its nature. In this chapter we will consider the matter of motive. Our nature must be gold and silver, and our motive must be pure. When the church is in desolation, and we want to determine whether we should participate in the work of a certain preacher, we need to discern the nature and motive of the work. One who works for the Lord must have a clear motive, not a cloudy one. A clear motive is pure; a cloudy motive is mixed and impure. Paul says that some preach Christ because of envy (Phil. 1:15). Such persons may be zealous and obtain good results, but when we examine their motive, we see that their hearts are not pure.</p>
<p>In the Bible to be pure means to be only for God. In serving the Lord, we should be purely for Him and not for anything else. We should not covet anything for ourselves or have our own enjoyment. Moreover, we should not ask anything for ourselves. We should be wholly for God. Matthew 5:8 says, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.&rdquo; A pure heart is a heart fixed on God. Whenever our heart pursues something other than God instead of being fixed on God, it is no longer pure.</p>
<p>Some local churches are right in the truth, in their standing, and in their practice, but their motive is not pure. They want something other than God or have some other pursuit. Although they may claim to be a local church and say that they are not a sect, and although their appearance appears to confirm this, there still is an inward problem with their motive because they are seeking something other than God. Thus, we cannot look only at standing, truth, doctrine, and so-called condition; we need to see the inward motive. We should not apply this word only to others; we should first examine ourselves. Our standing, truth, doctrine, and practice may be right, but we may not be pleasing to God, because He searches our heart to see our motive. God considers our heart an important matter.</p>
<p>First Samuel 13:14 says that David was a man according to God&rsquo;s heart. David was according to God&rsquo;s heart because his heart was right and pure toward God. David cared only for God and not for himself. In contrast, Saul cared only for himself and not for God. Although Saul was the anointed one with the proper position, his heart toward God was not right. In such a situation we must be like Jonathan and choose to follow David. We should not follow Saul simply because of his position. We need to see through his position to ascertain his motive. David&rsquo;s followers acknowledged Saul&rsquo;s position and standing as God&rsquo;s anointed, but they also recognized his motive before God. They saw that despite Saul&rsquo;s position, his heart toward God was not right. They also realized that although David did not have any position, his heart toward God was clean and pure. Saul had the proper position, but because his heart was improper, he lost the position; David did not have the position, but because he had a proper heart, he eventually obtained the position.</p>
<p>Just as a king cannot sit on the throne with a wrong motive, we cannot use our position in the church as a shield. We cannot say that our way is of the Lord because it is the position of the church. Everything hinges on our motive. Are the activities in our locality for God or for ourselves? Our answer will reveal whether we are a David or a Saul. Saul did not have a pure heart; those without a pure heart may have the right position, but in a short time they will lose that position.</p>
<p>To determine whether we can work with certain brothers or sisters, we need to discern their inward motive. We need to see whether they are for the Lord or for themselves and whether their heart is pure or mixed. This is not a high doctrine, but it is a crucial question regarding our inward condition. If we do not have a pure, single heart for God in our service, we should not expect to find co-workers like David. When our heart is even slightly impure, those who have a pure heart cannot work with us. We should not think that someone who does not work with us is sectarian. Putting a person who has a pure heart with a person who has an impure heart is a terrible mixture; it is Babylon the Great. We cannot condemn the sin of sectarianism while upholding the sin of mixture.</p>
<p>Those who are pure in heart will find others who live before God to be their co-workers. Since their heart has been dealt with, they are able to discern the condition of the heart of those they contact. The pure in heart stand together to maintain the Lord&rsquo;s testimony, walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way, and do the Lord&rsquo;s work because inwardly their hearts are pure, not because they share the same doctrinal viewpoint. Differences in opinion related to doctrine lead to divisions. When one who is pure in heart meets another person who is pure in heart, he can willingly be martyred for that person and love him as if he were the Lord. We gain the best co-workers and companions when we are pure in heart.</p>
<p>We should not be foolish in choosing our co-workers. Just as a person cannot change his marriage, we cannot change our co-workers. If we are co-working with one person today and another person tomorrow, we have a problem. Our ability to work with someone depends on our heart. If I am accustomed to breathing fresh air, and I smell stale, dank air when I enter a room, I will not be able to take it. However, if I am accustomed to stale, dank air, then I will not even notice it. If someone has a problem in his heart, and we do not recognize it, there is a problem with our heart as well. A person whose heart has been dealt with before the Lord can discern the heart of others. If our heart is pure, we can tell whether or not the heart of others is pure.</p>
<p>The companions I chose when I first began to serve the Lord are still my companions today; I have not changed my companions. Please forgive me for saying this&mdash;this is because when I was called to serve the Lord, my heart was pure; I only knew that the Lord had touched me and wanted me to live for Him. The first person I encountered was Brother Watchman Nee. I knew that I must be his co-worker, and I put myself under him because I felt that his heart was purely for God.</p>
<p>I coordinated with another brother for about twenty years before he passed away. There were no problems between us because the Lord brought us together. I felt that his heart was for nothing but the Lord. I can testify that he paid a great price for the church and suffered much. However, he never had any feeling for himself, nor did he speak for himself. He had a pure heart; thus, we served the Lord together in one accord and walked in the Lord&rsquo;s way together. Only those who are pure in heart can walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way.</p><h2 class="head3">Serving the Lord Requiring a Pure Heart</h2>
<p>Some people have asked me to show them where the Bible says that we should leave the denominations. My answer is based on 2 Timothy 2:20-21: &ldquo;...some unto dishonor. If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these...&rdquo; In the denominations there are many vessels unto dishonor and items of mixture; therefore, we must cleanse ourselves from them. We should work with those who are pure in heart. To leave the denominations is to cleanse ourselves from vessels unto dishonor. Although some groups say that they have no particular ground, truth, fellowship, or practice, we can still see the &ldquo;wood,&rdquo; &ldquo;earth,&rdquo; and confusion among them. We see dishonorable things, such as covetousness, human effort, and impurity in service. If we realize that someone does not have a pure heart, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot participate in what he is doing; I cannot be his co-worker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God is not pleased with those who make divisions over doctrinal issues, such as pre-tribulation versus post-tribulation rapture. The decision to separate from others must be made on the basis of nature and motive. The Bible clearly tells us to cleanse ourselves from vessels unto dishonor. We should be accommodating in other matters, but the Bible does not require us to accommodate anything of dishonor.</p>
<p>Lowliness is different from dishonor. God wants us to go along with the lowly (Rom. 12:16) but to cleanse ourselves from the dishonorable. Lowliness is a matter of situation and position; dishonor is a matter of nature. A piece of gold beneath our feet is not dishonorable; it is just lowly. However, if a clump of mud is beneath our feet, it is not simply a matter of lowliness, because mud is dishonorable by nature. If something is dishonorable, it is mud instead of gold; although we may elevate mud to a high and glorious position, it is still dishonorable. We should cleanse ourselves from what is dishonorable (2 Tim. 2:21). If we leave the denominations merely for the sake of doctrine or practices, our action has little value in God&rsquo;s eyes. If we leave the denominations on the basis of nature and motive, God will be pleased.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that the overcomers will be raptured in separate groups. However, someone else might have the peace to believe that all the believers are raptured at once, either before or after the tribulation; I would not argue with him about this. If his nature is gold and silver, we can work together, but if he is earth and wood, we cannot work together, regardless of our doctrinal positions. The rapture is not a question of doctrine; it is a matter of loving the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. Perhaps a brother gives a message on the doctrine of the rapture while coveting something apart from the Lord; this means that his heart is not pure, which is something that I cannot accept. If we both love the Lord and turn our heart to Him, then we can labor together. If we work with someone who desires something apart from God, we have a problem. We should work only with those whose nature is gold and silver and whose heart is pure.</p>
<p>A brother once exhorted me to be sociable and adaptable in order to be able to deal with all kinds of people. I would ask that brother how many companions he has who are of one heart with him. In the spiritual realm there are no diplomats or politicians. No one can gain companions through diplomacy. In God&rsquo;s house there are only vessels unto honor and vessels unto dishonor; we cannot use politics to gain companions. The more we live before God, receiving the breaking of the cross so that we desire God alone, the more we will be able to find pure-hearted companions. Companions that we gain using our methods, learning, position, and charisma will end up &ldquo;biting&rdquo; us. We should not decide to work with others by looking at their abilities or learning. This will be harmful to us. We have only one realm, that is, God Himself. We need to learn to live in God and take Him as our goal.</p><h2 class="head3">Praying to the Lord Equaling Rejecting the Self</h2>
<p>We need to be pure in heart, but we also need to pray to the Lord. It is not enough to have a pure heart; we need to pray as well. Prayer means that we reject and do not rely on ourselves in spiritual matters, in church affairs, and in matters related to the work and serving the Lord. Prayer also means that we are not for ourselves but for the Lord and that we do not follow our own will but the Lord&rsquo;s will. To pray to the Lord means that we are afraid of our own will and seek only the Lord&rsquo;s will. Suppose a brother preaches the gospel with a single motive and a pure heart, but instead of praying earnestly before preaching the gospel, he relies on newspaper ads and other human methods. This shows that he has not learned lessons before God and submitted to Him. His view, ideas, thoughts, concepts, opinions, and methods have not been swept away by God. He has not handed himself over to the Lord and learned to seek the Lord&rsquo;s will. This kind of person will have difficulty coordinating with others in the service. Thus, we must be pure in heart and pray to the Lord.</p>
<p>A pure heart seeks only God, and prayer implies that there is nothing of the self. Prayer means that we allow the Lord to do everything according to His way and not according to man&rsquo;s opinion. If we do things out of ourselves by human methods, opinions, and power, we have no need of prayer. This is similar to the fact that when we ride in a car, we do not need to walk. Whether we can find those whom the Lord has raised up to be our companions depends not only on the purity of our heart but also on whether we have stopped all the activity of the self. Have we stopped our ability, cleverness, methods, and wisdom? Do we submit ourselves to the Lord and seek His leading, or do we insist on our opinions? If we want to push our opinions through, we do not need to pray; if we want to submit ourselves to the Lord and seek His leading, we need to pray.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 2:22 says that we need to &ldquo;call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo; Our focus is on calling on the Lord and having a pure heart. Anything added to our physical body from the outside cannot become one with our body. In the same principle, if we are ones who pray to the Lord out of a pure heart, we cannot be joined to someone who does not. This is not a question of sectarianism. If we call this sectarianism and try to join with ones who do not pray out of a pure heart, God will condemn us, because He condemns any mixture. The pure in heart and those with an impure heart, those who rely on the Lord and those who do not rely on the Lord, and those who are led by the Lord in their work and those who work by their own methods should not be mixed together. No mixture is approved by God.</p>
<p>In Exodus 32:26, after the Israelites worshipped the golden calf, Moses, as God&rsquo;s representative, said, &ldquo;Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me.&rdquo; Then the Levites separated themselves to Moses. God never tolerates mixture among His children. Cleansing ourselves from the vessels of dishonor as mentioned in 2 Timothy 2:20-21 is a matter within the church. In the desolation of the church we need to cleanse ourselves from the vessels unto dishonor who are within the church. In order to be vessels unto honor, we need to reject the dishonorable ones; we must cleanse ourselves from them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Fellowshipping in Life</h2>
<p>First John speaks concerning the desolation of the church. The desolation mentioned in 1 John involves those who go beyond the teaching of Christ in their preaching and thus become antichrists. The Holy Spirit deals with this problem through John&rsquo;s Epistle. John uses the fellowship of life to correct this error of the desolation. First John 1:3 says, &ldquo;That which we have seen and heard we report also to you that you also may have fellowship with us.&rdquo; We can be one and be in fellowship because we have the fellowship of life. Whoever does not have the fellowship of life is different from us and cannot be in fellowship with us.</p>
<p>First John 2:19 says, &ldquo;They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but they went out that they might be manifested that they all are not of us.&rdquo; We know those who are of us because there is fellowship between them and us; some go out from us because there is no fellowship between them and us. In 1 John 2 we see that some went out from the apostles because they were not of the apostles. They were not of the apostles, because the apostles had the life of Christ, and they did not. They were Christians without the life of Christ. Because they did not believe that Christ had come in the flesh, they did not have the eternal life. Thus, they could not fellowship with or be joined to the apostles. The joining is the eternal life mentioned in 1 John 1. As believers, we are joined to the apostles because we all have the same eternal life, and the apostles are joined to God and to His Son.</p>
<p>In the desolation of the church the basis of our joining with anyone who calls himself a Christian is the inner fellowship of life. Without the fellowship of life there cannot be any joining together. John says that saved Christians cannot have fellowship with those who do not believe in Christ as the Son of God. Since they cannot fellowship, they must go their separate ways.</p>
<p>We may have the thought that if we allow those with whom we cannot fellowship to go their separate ways, it will result in more divisions. I am not encouraging the brothers and sisters to divide; rather, I hope that we will see that in the desolation of the church, relationships among the believers are a matter of fellowship. Regardless of outward similarities, if there is no fellowship of life between two people, they cannot be joined. We should not argue with others about doctrines; we need to learn to live in the eternal life and to sense whether or not fellowship is possible. A very courteous brother once exhorted me not to divide from others. However, I asked him, &ldquo;When you stay with these ones for a long time, how do you feel inwardly?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;When I am with them, I do not feel comfortable inwardly. Nonetheless, the Lord tells us to be one and that we should bear the cross.&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;If you are happy about bearing this cross, then bear it; however, what will the result be? Can you rescue such ones and cause them to know God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>God never intended for us to be involved in this kind of oneness during the desolation of the church. Others do not do this, and neither can we. If we want to accept others, why not accept the Catholic Church? There are many saved ones in the Catholic Church; if we go with them to burn incense and kiss the feet of idols, we might gain some of them. Why should we be particularly gracious to a certain group of Christians and bear with them? The oneness has been destroyed, and God has not told us to restore it. On the contrary, He wants us to cleanse ourselves from dishonorable vessels. I am not encouraging the creation of divisions; however, we need to pay attention to the inner fellowship of life during the desolation of the church. When life cannot flow through, we should not force it.</p>
<p>We stand before the Lord whom we serve, and we have no intention of drawing anyone to be with us. Such a goal should be condemned; it is low and shameful. Since I have been in Taiwan, I have said, &ldquo;You can meet wherever you choose as long as it is beneficial to you.&rdquo; As long as there is the fellowship of life, any gathering is suitable. If we bring people to our meetings but do not bring them into the fellowship of God&rsquo;s life, whatever we do is accursed. Many of us know each other in a deep way; if one among us takes a different way, I would be hurt in my emotions because I am a man. However, in my spirit, I would say, &ldquo;Lord, although my brother is taking a different way, as long as he can gain something of You, I just worship You.&rdquo; I especially beseech the brothers never to say to anyone, &ldquo;It is best that you come here to meet with us.&rdquo; This is foolishness. We should never play politics in our dealings with people; rather, we should exhort them to meet where they can receive help. Our hope should not be that people would come to our meetings; rather, our hope should be that we could touch the fellowship of life. We do not bring people to know us but to know the Lord. We do not bring people to enter into our meetings but to enter into the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>It is better for people to go elsewhere and gain God than to meet with us to merely increase our numbers. In a sense, the increase is not important; what really matters is whether or not we touch the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>The fellowship of life is crucial during the desolation of the church. If we are in a place in which we can fellowship, sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence, obtain the supply, and cause others to receive grace, be enlightened, and be saved, then that place is suitable. We should learn to take this approach during the desolation of the church. We cannot have our own choice, and we must learn to live in and to sense if others are in the fellowship of life.</p>
<p>If we live in the fellowship of life, we will be able to supply those whom we meet, and they will be able to obtain the supply from us. Furthermore, we must learn to obtain the supply from others. We need to supply others with life, and we need to receive the supply from them; this is to fellowship in life with one another. It is not a matter of outward doctrines but a matter of the inner life. We must learn to live in the fellowship of life before we can discern whether others are in it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Anointing</h2>
<p>First John 2:27 speaks of the anointing, and the context indicates that this word is related to being separated from antichrists. John tells us that there is a group of people called antichrists (v. 18) and that we should deal with them by the anointing. It is not enough to speak of fellowship; in addition to fellowship there must be the anointing, that is, the anointing of the Holy Spirit who teaches us all things. We cannot work with some people, because we do not have the inner anointing when we are with them. This is not a matter of doctrine or oneness; it is a matter of the anointing and is spontaneous. I do not go to other Christian groups to preach, because when I am with those groups, I do not have the anointing. I feel released and have much to say here because I have the anointing. If I did not have the anointing, I would be restricted. Thus, wherever the anointing is, there we may go; otherwise, we should be limited.</p>
<p>We can clearly see in the Epistles that the focus during the desolation of the church is not on doctrinal issues but on nature and motive. We need to pay attention to our conscience, to the fellowship of life, and to the anointing. The anointing is the operating of the Holy Spirit, which causes us to sense God&rsquo;s presence and feel watered, fresh, bright, and living. We must do everything by discerning the anointing. In the desolation of the church we should not decide which Christians to meet and work with based on doctrinal considerations. Our conscience must be clear, and our heart must be pure. In nature we must be vessels unto honor. We must also learn to reject the natural man and the flesh by receiving the dealing of the cross in order to live before God. Only when we meet these conditions will there be no ground in us for the desolation of the church; then we will be able to pass the test and be approved by God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PROPER ATTITUDE DURING<br />
THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Be an Overcomer</h2>
<h2 class="head3">God Calling the Overcomers</h2>
<p>The final seven epistles from the Lord to the churches in Revelation 2 and 3 speak very clearly regarding the desolation of the church. At the end of each of the seven epistles, the Lord calls His believers to be overcomers in the desolation of the church; this call is also a command. Different grounds, doctrines, and ways are worthless, because having the proper ground, doctrine, or way does not make a person an overcomer. In order to be an overcomer, one must be an overcoming person.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that since God&rsquo;s people came into existence, there has been a group of people called the overcomers. In principle, whenever the majority of God&rsquo;s people failed and were in desolation, a minority stood in the proper position, representing all of God&rsquo;s people in carrying out His ministry. These ones are called overcomers.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the first time the overcomers are clearly seen among God&rsquo;s people is at Mount Sinai, when the Levites preserved God&rsquo;s testimony by standing on His side against idol worship. God&rsquo;s original intention was that all His people, Israel, would be priests to serve Him (Exo. 19:6), but at Mount Sinai most of them fell into desolation by worshipping the golden calf (32:1-8). The Levites rose up to maintain the testimony of God on behalf of all the Israelites. They took the position that all the Israelites should have taken. Therefore, God gave the priesthood exclusively to the Levites. From then on the Levites were the overcomers among God&rsquo;s people (vv. 25-29); they were responsible for the Ark, which was in their midst. When the children of Israel moved in the wilderness, the Levites carried the Ark (Deut. 10:8). When they stopped, the Levites surrounded the Ark (Num. 1:50, 53). God&rsquo;s testimony was upon them and among them.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel crossed the Jordan River, the Levites were the first to step into the water, and they stood in the river until all the Israelites crossed over safely on dry ground (Josh. 3:14-17). Thus, there was a small group of overcomers among the Israelites who maintained God&rsquo;s testimony. When they entered Canaan, all the Israelites should have fought for the kingdom of God, but they lost their position as warriors. A very small group of people, particularly Gideon and his three hundred mighty men (Judg. 7:7), fought for God in place of all the Israelites. When Israel lost its standing, these three hundred stood as overcomers. Later, Samuel and David were overcomers. Before the captivity Elijah, Elisha, and Isaiah were overcomers; Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel were overcomers during the captivity; and Ezra and Nehemiah were overcomers after the captivity. These men were clearly overcomers during the desolation of Israel. Some bore God&rsquo;s testimony while suffering persecution. Others maintained and recovered God&rsquo;s testimony in the face of Gentile idols after the captivity to Gentile lands.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the entire church was up to God&rsquo;s standard on the day of Pentecost, standing in the proper position and maintaining the testimony of God. Regrettably, this condition did not last long, and soon the church became degraded and desolate. However, Paul and Timothy were overcomers in the desolation. Paul says in 2 Timothy 1:15, &ldquo;All who are in Asia turned away from me.&rdquo; Demas, Paul&rsquo;s co-worker, loved the world and left Paul (4:10). Although Paul saw the desolation of the church, he still spoke for the Lord; even when he was imprisoned, in chains, and in danger for his life, he was not afraid or upset. He was an overcomer who stood in the proper position of the church to maintain the testimony of God.</p>
<p>When John wrote the seven epistles in Revelation, the church for the most part had fallen into desolation. At this time the Lord began to call out overcomers. The overcomers stand in the position in which most of the believers should be standing in but have lost. The entire church should be standing as a testimony, fighting for God; however, it is not, and most members of the church have fallen. The desolation of the church has continued and progressed over the past two thousand years. Nevertheless, in every age there is a small number of people who answer God&rsquo;s call and stand in the proper position of the church to maintain the testimony of God and fight for His kingdom. This group of people is the overcomers.</p>
<p>Thus, in the seven epistles in Revelation the Lord&rsquo;s call to the overcomers is a very important teaching. The Lord&rsquo;s final commandment is that the believers be overcomers. The overcomers are the man-child brought forth by the woman in Revelation 12:5. The woman signifies all of God&rsquo;s people; she is the aggregate of all those whom God has saved through the ages. The man-child signifies the few who are strong in the church, the overcomers. Revelation 12:11 says, &ldquo;They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.&rdquo; The overcoming believers in this verse are the man-child brought forth by the woman, and they are also the overcomers spoken of in the seven epistles in chapters 2 and 3. In chapters 17 and 18 they follow the Lamb to fight; in chapter 20 they follow the Lord to reign with Him (vv. 4, 6). The overcomers are the saints who take the place of the defeated believers to fulfill God&rsquo;s intention in the church.</p>
<p>During the desolation of the church, the Lord&rsquo;s only desire is that we would be overcomers. The Lord does not want us merely to preach the truth or stand on the proper ground of the church; He wants us to overcome. If we do not overcome, there is a problem with the truth we hold, the way in which we walk, and the ground upon which we stand. It is not enough to hold to orthodox truths and walk in the way of the church; we must also be overcomers.</p>
<p>The five requirements the Lord has given, including dealing with the conscience, discerning the nature of people, matters, and works, dealing with our motives and discerning the motives of others, living in the fellowship of life no matter whom we contact or are related to, and paying attention to the anointing, are related to being an overcomer.</p><h2 class="head3">How to Be an Overcomer</h2>
<p>We need to see what the Lord says concerning the church&rsquo;s overcoming in the seven epistles in Revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Recovering the First Love for the Lord</h2>
<p>In the first epistle the Lord asks the overcomers to recover or keep their first love for the Lord (2:4-5). According to the order of the seven epistles, the desolation of the church began with losing the first love for the Lord. Initially, the church&rsquo;s love toward the Lord was fresh. Out of this fresh love, the church followed and served the Lord. However, at a certain point in time, the church lost its first love for the Lord, although it was still zealous in works and labor. Because the first love was lost, there was a problem in life. In the first epistle to Ephesus, we see the tree of life (v. 7) and the lampstand (v. 5). Because the church lost its first love, it had a problem in life, and the light of its testimony was no longer clear. Thus, the lampstand was removed. The church was in a condition of desolation. Since this is the first epistle, it is a record of the beginning and cause of the desolation. This beginning, this cause, was the losing of the first love for the Lord. Therefore, the overcomers must constantly maintain their love for the Lord in the desolation of the church.</p>
<p>The world, fame, and position are not the only things that can cause us to lose our love for the Lord; even the blessings God gives us or the work in our hands can cause us to lose our love for the Lord. This is the result when a work is not done out of love for the Lord or if the fellowship in love with the Lord is lost during the course of the work. If we are like this, we are defeated. All our work should be a matter of love between the Lord and us.</p>
<p>We preach the gospel because we love the Lord. Because we have a fresh love for Him, our gospel work does not replace the Lord. We build up the church because of our fellowship of love with the Lord; we administrate the church in a proper way because there is a story of love between us and the Lord. In our love to the Lord we administrate His church and preach the truth to the saints for their edification. Our work and service should issue out of our love for the Lord.</p>
<p>Many among us have experienced working for the Lord without loving Him. We should not make our service a profession. We make our service a profession when we lose our first love toward the Lord. A nanny feeds children in the course of her profession, but a mother feeds her children out of love instead of professional duty. If our preaching of the gospel is just a duty, we have fallen. It should not be a matter of duty but of love.</p>
<p>Every morning we should fellowship with the Lord in love, with a feeling of love, the love of the bridal days (Jer. 2:2). We must turn afresh to the Lord and renew our consecration to Him. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You in the same way that I loved You on the day I first met You. Our relationship is as it was in the bridal days.&rdquo; This is what the book of Jeremiah says about the love of the bridal days. The losing of the first love in the epistle to Ephesus is the same as the Israelites&rsquo; losing the love of their bridal days for the Lord. In order to be overcomers in the desolation of the church, we must maintain our fresh love for the Lord. Every day we must say, &ldquo;O Lord, our relationship is like that of a newly married couple. Lord, I have a fresh heart for You, a fresh hope in You, and a fresh turn to You. Lord, I also have a fresh enjoyment of You and a fresh knowledge of You.&rdquo; Then such a love will motivate us to do His work; this is to be constrained by the love of Christ (2 Cor. 5:14).</p>
<p>When the elders administrate the church, they should pour themselves out for the saints because they are constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love. If we do not pour ourselves out for His church, God&rsquo;s heart will not be happy. What makes God&rsquo;s heart the happiest is the building up of His church; God loves and treasures the church more than anything else. Because we love Him and care for His heart&rsquo;s desire, we are willing to sacrifice everything for the church. This is the first requirement for being an overcomer.</p>
<p>We should search our hearts to see whether our work has become a profession. When we administrate the church, are we doing something merely out of duty? When we serve the church, are we doing it merely out of diligence? If this is the case, we are finished. When others contact us, they should sense that we have a fresh love toward the Lord and that we have freshly tasted the Lord&rsquo;s love. The only motivation behind our daily living should be our love for the Lord. We should be for the church, for sinners, and for the Lord&rsquo;s way because we have a strong love for the Lord. Because Lord&rsquo;s loveliness has deeply touched and attracted us, we have no murmurings or other motives. All our labor and actions come out of this love.</p>
<p>Others can sense when we are in such a loving condition, and we ourselves know it even more. When such a person gives a message, he will sense not so much that Jesus is the Lord but that He is the lovely One. The relationship of such a person with the Lord is not one of servant and master but one of mutual love. We should have prayers before the Lord that are not begging prayers but more like a loving consultation. We may say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I like this; how do You feel? I want to know if You like it too. I do not want Your commandment; I want to know Your heart, and I want to live in the feeling of Your heart. I do not want You to give me a command; I want to know Your heart. Lord, I love You.&rdquo; Every servant of the Lord should be a lover of the Lord. If a servant of the Lord is not like the Shulammite in the Song of Songs, he has a problem. Therefore, the first requirement for overcoming is to have a fresh love for the Lord and to maintain the first love for the Lord.</p>
<p>If our work is blessed or if we become a famous preacher in Christianity, we are in danger of losing our love for the Lord without having any feeling about it. That is a dangerous situation. If we treasure our position or the blessing on our work more than we treasure the Lord Himself, we will lose our fellowship in love with the Lord. Many famous preachers today have fallen into this trap.</p>
<p>We should not care to be a person who works for the Lord, a person of great renown, or a person whose work is effective; rather, we should care to be a person who loves the Lord. Everything we do in our service, work, and meetings should have the flavor of the loving virgins in Song of Songs 1:3. This flavor indicates a proper condition. A church without this flavor is in the desolate condition of Ephesus. The service of the deacons in the church office should give people a sense of love for Christ. If the deacons give people only the sense that everything is orderly and that the work is carried out diligently and thoroughly, the office is merely a place of business. The office should manifest love; it should be filled with love. The serving ones should cause others to touch the love of Christ, and they should touch the saints&rsquo; love for Christ. Our service should cause others to touch love, and we should have a fresh love for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head4">Being Faithful unto Death</h2>
<p>The second of the seven epistles was written to the church in Smyrna (Rev. 2:8-11). The Lord did not rebuke the church in Smyrna; He only praised it. However, in the epistle to Smyrna the Lord commanded the saints to overcome; He wanted them to be faithful unto death (v. 10). In other words, because of their love for Him, they were not even to care for their lives. Because they have a strong conflict between their interest and the Lord&rsquo;s interest, people do not remain faithful. If we set aside our own interest, we can be faithful. A person&rsquo;s greatest interest is his life. If we disregard our own life, it is easy to be faithful. The young brothers and sisters must pay special attention because in many matters they have not learned the lesson to be faithful. Some are not even willing to sacrifice their sleep, not to mention being faithful unto death. Our faithfulness will be proved when we are entrusted with some matters.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s faithfulness in the matter of service shows how much love he has for the Lord. The extent to which we love Him is the extent to which we will be faithful. For example, a mother is faithful in caring for her children. If a sister would be as faithful in her service as a mother who cares for her children, she might be the most faithful one among us. Thus, the second call, the call to be faithful, is based on the first call. The second requirement for overcoming is based on the first requirement. If there is no love, there will be no faithfulness.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Abandoning the Teachings and Organizations<br />
That Were Not Present at the Beginning</h2>
<p>The third epistle was written to the church in Pergamos (2:12-17). The church in Pergamos had the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans (vv. 14-15). The situation described in this passage was fulfilled in church history when Constantine accepted Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire in the fourth century. The teaching of Balaam causes people to worship idols and seek material reward; the teaching of the Nicolaitans controls people by organization. When these teachings entered the church, the Lord commanded the believers to overcome by not accepting the teaching of Balaam or the teaching of the Nicolaitans. None of the teachings in the church should have anything to do with idols, profit, or organization. The church should completely abandon such human teachings and organizations.</p>
<p>This requirement differs from the first requirement for overcoming. The first requirement is related to recovering what has been lost, but the third requirement is related to abandoning what was not present in the beginning. In this epistle the Lord does not speak of sin and the world; He touches only the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans. In order to overcome during the desolation of the church, we must not participate in human teachings or organizations.</p>
<p>In the epistle to Ephesus, the overcomers are promised the tree of life (v. 7); in the epistle to the church in Pergamos, the promise is the hidden manna (v. 17). In the third epistle the requirement for overcoming is deeper, and the promise is more intimate. The hidden manna signifies the hidden Christ. Manna is a type of Christ as food to God&rsquo;s people, that is, as life. However, the hidden manna cannot be enjoyed by those who live outside of God; it is enjoyed only by those who live in the Holy of Holies before God&rsquo;s face. The fruit of the tree of life is open and common, but the hidden manna is hidden and special. The fruit of the tree of life signifies Christ as man&rsquo;s life, and the hidden manna signifies Christ as man&rsquo;s food. The two have the same function, but the enjoyment is different. Some enjoy Christ as the tree of life; others enjoy Christ as the hidden manna. The level of enjoyment in these two cases is different.</p>
<p>When the church has the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans, that is, when the church is full of human opinions and organization, those who refuse, reject, and abandon these teachings and stand on the Lord&rsquo;s side to maintain His testimony will be able to experience Christ as the hidden manna. They will have Christ as their life supply, but the flavor of that supply will be the hidden manna, which others do not know. Others will not be able to touch or taste the Christ that these overcomers experience and enjoy.</p>
<p>Today Christianity is under the teaching of Balaam and the teaching of the Nicolaitans. In Christianity there are idols, wealth, position, and authoritarian control. However, it is difficult for people in Christianity to enjoy Christ, much less the hidden manna. If people refuse human teachings and organization and live a hidden life before God, they will be able to experience and enjoy the hidden Christ. This is why we do not advertise. We are willing to serve the Lord for our whole lives without being recognized by others. We are not willing to do anything in the name, organization, or realm of Christianity. The desire for even a little fame is a Nicolaitan thought. Some people eloquently argue that if we would just slightly change our methods, we would be well known in Christianity, and our work would be more effective. Their words are very persuasive, and if we were like Balaam, they would be like the bait on a fishhook to catch us and carry us away.</p>
<p>The year I began to serve the Lord, an old pastor advised me, &ldquo;Your way of working is no good. If you do what I tell you to do, you will become a famous preacher.&rdquo; This is the way of Balaam and the Nicolaitans. If we are seeking fame or position, we will have no share in the enjoyment of the overcomers; we will not taste, touch, or experience the hidden manna.</p>
<p>What we fear most is that what we do and who we are would be known. The name <em>Pergamos</em> has two meanings: &ldquo;strong tower&rdquo; and &ldquo;marriage.&rdquo; Whenever we aspire to a high position, we are married to the world. When we are in union with the world, we may become famous, and our work may be a high tower. Thus, the church in which we meet will also be a high tower. I fear for the young people; they love the Lord and have been called by Him, but the way that they are taking today is worrisome. I dare not say that they are taking the way of Balaam, but I am afraid it is a way of marriage. They want to be famous preachers and those with a position. They want their work to be well known, to become a high tower, in Christianity. All such things are in the realm of Pergamos.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us that, if possible, who we are and what we do would not be known by others. If possible, may our names not appear in the newspapers. Let us never take that way. We must learn to be as hidden as possible. I hope that we are without a name; I hope that we will work without being famous. If we want worldly fame, a high tower, and things of the marriage with the world, then we cannot enjoy the hidden Christ or the hidden manna before God. This is the command and requirement in the third epistle.</p><h2 class="head4">Abandoning the Teachings of Jezebel</h2>
<p>The fourth epistle was written to the church in Thyatira (vv. 18-29), which corresponds with the Roman Catholic Church. The church in Thyatira is full of idols, fornication, and the deep things of Satan (vv. 20, 24). The history of the Roman Catholic Church shows that in both practical and spiritual matters, Catholicism is full of idols, fornication, and the deep things of Satan. I am afraid that on this earth, Satan cannot find another place that has developed his thought as completely and thoroughly as the Roman Catholic Church. We could never describe all the idols, fornication, and heretical thoughts in Catholicism. In order to overcome, we must completely abandon the things of Catholicism.</p>
<p>In the epistle to Thyatira the matter of authority is emphasized. The Roman Catholic Church has an earthly position, but it has lost its authority before God. Therefore, anyone who leaves Catholicism and rejects the things of the Roman Catholic Church will be able to receive authority from God.</p>
<p>In the face of such desolation, we should leave everything that is apart from the Lord and everything related to Catholicism. We should return to the first love for the Lord. Then we will enjoy Christ as life and receive authority from the Lord. Prophetically, authority in verse 26 refers to reigning with the Lord; practically speaking, one who lives before the Lord has spiritual authority today.</p>
<p>According to the fourth epistle, a basic requirement for overcoming is to abandon the worldly things brought in by fallen Catholicism. Spiritually speaking, the worldly things are nothing more than idols and fornication. The principle of idolatry is to desire something other than God; the principle of fornication is to be united with something other than God. Thus, to be an overcomer, we must turn away from everything other than God and be for Him alone. Then we will enjoy the Lord as life and have His authority.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Rejecting Weakness (Death)</h2>
<p>The fifth epistle, to the church in Sardis (3:1-6), does not cover the matters for which Pergamos and Thyatira were condemned. The problem with the church in Sardis is that it is very weak (vv. 1-2), and this weakness has become its defilement (v. 4). Weakness defiles a church because weakness is the forerunner of death. Weakness taken to the extreme is death. Therefore, we must never sympathize with weakness. Death is the most defiling thing before God. In the Old Testament a person could offer a sacrifice to atone for the commission of a sin. However, a person who touched a corpse or anything dead was defiled and had to be separated for seven days before he could be cleansed (Num. 19:11-19). Strictly speaking, sin is not necessarily a defilement, because it is a matter of breaking God&rsquo;s law; death is the real defilement. To God, death is the dirtiest thing. The precursor of death is weakness; weakness is a sign of death. In God&rsquo;s eyes, weakness is equivalent to death. The church in Sardis had many works, but the works were weak and incomplete (Rev. 3:2).</p>
<p>Sometimes we taste the flavor of Sardis in the bread-breaking meeting; the hymn singing and prayer are not strong, and nothing is complete. Sometimes we taste the flavor of Sardis in the fellowship meetings; the testimonies and even the announcements are weak. The church in Sardis does not have idols, the teaching of the Nicolaitans, fornication, or the deep things of Satan, but whatever it has is weak. Sardis has everything, but everything is weak. Sardis has the table meeting, the prayer meeting, the message meeting, and the gospel meeting, but they are all weak. Everything is weak, lacking in life, vitality, freshness, and light; this is Sardis.</p>
<p>An overcomer is a person who is strong, living, shining, and fresh. He gives the impression that he is fresh and living, not outwardly but inwardly. He is up when everyone else is down; he rises up when no one else is able to rise up. He is living, shining, fresh, and strong whenever he opens his mouth. He is strong even in calling a hymn. His prayer in the meetings is strong. People do not touch weakness and death in him; instead, they touch something of life, something full and without lack. This is the fifth requirement of an overcomer.</p>
<p>We cannot merely hold to the so-called ground, way, or truth; we must be living, fresh, and strong. We should not focus on whether or not our actions are right, because they may be full of death. Rather, we should enliven others and make them strong inwardly. May the Lord have mercy on us and make us those who are living; these are the overcomers in Sardis.</p><h2 class="head4">Keeping the Love for the Brothers</h2>
<p>The sixth epistle was written to the church in Philadelphia (vv. 7-13). <em>Philadelphia</em> means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; In this epistle, the Lord says, &ldquo;You have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name&rdquo; (v. 8). The believers kept the Lord&rsquo;s name and His word in love, and their situation was expressed in the love among the brothers. Overcomers love the brothers; this brotherly love is emphasized and explained in the Epistles of John. Our love for the brothers is not the human love of natural emotions but a pure love. This is the brotherly love in Philadelphia.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Not Being Self-satisfied</h2>
<p>Finally, the seventh epistle was written to the church in Laodicea (vv. 14-22). Laodicea was lukewarm and self-satisfied (vv. 16-17). When we think that we are sufficient, we have become self-satisfied. When we are self-satisfied, Christ is excluded. Moreover, lukewarmness also excludes Christ. When we are lukewarm, the Lord stands outside the door (v. 20). This door is not an individual door but a corporate door, the door of the church. Christ is outside, not inside, the church in Laodicea.</p>
<p>In order to be overcomers during the desolation of the church, we must hate lukewarmness. If we are satisfied because we have the light of the truth and blessing on our work, we are in the condition of Laodicea. The light of the truth and blessing on our work cannot replace the Lord; on the contrary, they may be a frustration to the Lord. If these things capture us and make us satisfied, the Lord will be outside the door.</p>
<p>We must seek the Lord. We should not love the Lord&rsquo;s work or His truth but rather enjoy the Lord Himself (v. 18). If we hear His voice, we should open the door, and He will come in to us and dine with us and we with Him. He will enjoy us, and we will enjoy Him (v. 20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Needing to Love the Lord</h2>
<p>The promises in the last three epistles are related to the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The promise to Sardis says, &ldquo;They will walk with Me in white&rdquo; (v. 4); this is a matter of being with the Lord. The promise to Philadelphia says, &ldquo;Him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God&rdquo; (v. 12); this is also a matter of being with the Lord. The promise to Laodicea says, &ldquo;I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me&rdquo; (v. 20); this, too, is a matter of being with the Lord.</p>
<p>The seven epistles in Revelation should be divided into a group of three and a group of four, with the first three epistles forming one section and the last four forming another (see <em>Meditations on Revelation,</em> in <em>The Collected Works of Watchman Nee,</em> vol. 4, p. 270). However, according to their promises, the last three epistles are in the same category. The first four epistles show that the root of the desolation of the church is the losing of the first love for the Lord. The church fell to such an extent that the Lord left it, and it was filled with the things of the world, producing the church in Thyatira, the Roman Catholic Church. Thus, the last three epistles speak of the church in recovery. We must leave everything apart from the Lord. We must leave anything related to Catholicism and return to the first love for the Lord.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the seven epistles it speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s love, and at the end it speaks of the fellowship in love. These epistles show that, regardless of the extent of the desolation of the church and whether our circumstances are good or bad, we must simply love the Lord and desire Him alone. We should not desire anything apart from the Lord, such as idols or heresies. We should not be satisfied with having the Lord&rsquo;s blessing; only the Lord Himself should satisfy us. We should seek the Lord alone, love Him, and draw near to Him. We should learn to live before Him and enjoy Him as the tree of life, the hidden manna, and our food. We should be strong in the midst of weak, dying, and dead Sardis. We should love the brothers and the church, and we should have a genuine testimony. If we put the seven preceding points together, we can see the attitude, requirements, and conditions that we must have during the desolation of the church.</p>
<p>We should not take these epistles in a doctrinal way; rather, we should apply them to ourselves, examining and judging ourselves. The writer of these epistles is the One with eyes like a flame of fire and feet like shining bronze as having been fired in a furnace (1:14-15), and out of His mouth proceeds a sharp two-edged sword (v. 16). Each call to the overcomers is like a judgment. Each local church must prostrate itself before the Lord&rsquo;s throne in sackcloth and ashes, with sorrow and fasting, and pray to the Lord: &ldquo;Even if the majority of the believers fail, we would be the small number of Levites who carry the Ark and go on.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">ASSISTANCE AND HINDRANCES<br />
TO THE COURSE OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE STORY OF HUMANITY&mdash;<br />
RELIGION, CULTURE, AND GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>From the day the church was produced, it has been assisted and hindered in many ways. In order to have a thorough knowledge of the course of the church, we need to know what conveniences and problems it has encountered. Without knowing this, it is difficult to understand the course of the church, because the course of the church is very much related to the assistance it has received and the hindrances it has encountered.</p>
<p>In analyzing the course of the church, it is easy to see that it has been assisted and hindered in certain ways. The assistance and the hindrances come from the same source, that is, from humanity itself. These things are not only part of the history of the church but also are a factor in the situation of the church today. They are not only instructive but also are warnings to us.</p>
<p>Since the church comes out from humanity and exists among human beings, it cannot avoid having a relationship with humanity. The fact that the church comes out of the human race is typified by Rebecca (Gen. 24), and its existence among human beings is typified by Asenath (41:45). Moreover, the spread and growth of the church are also in humanity. To use an unpleasant term, the church is a &ldquo;parasite&rdquo; in humanity. Without humanity, there is no church; if humanity were destroyed, the church could not exist. Therefore, the relationship between the church and humanity is deep, close, and marvelous. The church came into existence in humanity, and although it is called out from humanity, it is kept by God among human beings. Therefore, we must research the story of humanity in order to understand the assistance and hindrances that the church receives from human beings.</p>
<p>Human history can be broken down into the three broad categories of religion, culture, and government. Items like education, art, and sports fall into the category of culture. Some historians have said that Western history is a matter of Hebrew religion plus Greek culture and Roman politics; these three elements comprise Western culture and are the story of the Western peoples. Although Eastern culture is not a combination of Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics, it is still a matter of religion, culture, and politics. Moreover, in recent times Eastern culture has been influenced by the West.</p>
<p>When the church was produced, it immediately encountered Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics. When the Lord was crucified, a notice was posted on the cross: &ldquo;JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS&rdquo; (John 19:19-20). It was written in three languages&mdash;Hebrew, Latin (Roman), and Greek. This illustrates that while the Lord was on earth, He was dealing with an age composed of three factors: Hebrew religion (Judaism), Greek culture, and Roman politics. The Jewish religion was well-established and was flourishing among the Jewish people. Furthermore, the Jews built synagogues for the reading of the Old Testament in all the places to which they had been scattered. Sometimes even the Gentiles went to the synagogues to listen. Thus, Judaism was deeply rooted and widespread in the region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection and the producing of the church, Greek culture was prevalent in the area around the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean region was a bustling center of humanity. The Mediterranean Sea was in the middle of humanity; it was surrounded by human culture. The New World had not yet been discovered, and northern Europe was a barbarian land. The eastern regions of Asia were another world. If we exclude the Chinese, all the rest of humanity surrounded the Mediterranean Sea as a &ldquo;lake.&rdquo; On the northern shore was Europe, to the south was Africa, and on the eastern shore was the western part of Asia. Although the European, Asian, and African people in these regions had various languages and cultures, they all accepted Greek culture by the time the church was produced.</p>
<p>Students of history know that culture follows water, first by a river, then to the sea, and finally to the ocean. When the church was produced, the oceanic culture was not yet in existence; there was only the culture of the Mediterranean Sea. It is difficult to say how many languages were spoken by the peoples surrounding the Mediterranean, but Greek culture had spread to the entire region. Thus, the New Testament was written in Greek rather than Hebrew, despite the fact that most of it was written by Jewish apostles. All the people surrounding the Mediterranean Sea accepted Greek culture and could understand Greek.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by the time the church came into existence, the Roman Empire governed the entire region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Almost any area that had Jewish religion and Greek culture also had the politics of the Roman Empire. Therefore, human culture at that time was a mixture of Jewish religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics. Without these three things, human beings at that time would not have been much different from beasts. Religion, culture, and politics separated them from the animals.</p>
<p>Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics afforded the church many conveniences. This assistance was prepared beforehand by God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ASSISTANCE ENJOYED BY THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Assistance from Hebrew Religion (Judaism)</h2>
<p>In a sense, the church came out of Judaism; at least, the first group of people in the church came out of Judaism. The Old Testament occupies a significant portion of the Bible read by the church. The Jews and the members of the church believe in and worship the same one God. From a historical viewpoint, the early members of the church received most of their knowledge of God from Judaism. From a spiritual viewpoint, the revelation they received came from the Old Testament, which was originally in the hands of the Jews. Thus, Judaism gave the church a great advantage.</p>
<p>A very small portion, perhaps only one percent, of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry on the earth was in the realm of the Gentiles and to the Gentiles; the remaining ninety-nine percent was in Judaism and for the Jews. The &ldquo;manger&rdquo; that produced the church was the Jewish temple in Jerusalem; the temple was the place in which the church was produced. In Acts 1 the one hundred and twenty were praying in the upper room (v. 13) when they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit (2:2-4), but their meetings were held in the Jewish temple (v. 46). If Judaism had not persecuted the church, we would have to acknowledge that it helped the church enormously.</p>
<p>In the early days the apostles preached the gospel in Jewish synagogues (9:20; 13:5, 14; 14:1; 18:4; 19:8). Thus, they did not need to build meeting halls or prepare seating. Even after Paul passed through Asia and came to Macedonia in Europe, he went to a place of prayer beside the river on the Sabbath to preach the gospel (16:13). This was a convenience given to the church by Judaism. Furthermore, the Old Testament had been translated into Greek (the Septuagint version) so that even Greek-speaking Gentiles could read it. Paul did not need to print Bibles; he could simply enter a synagogue and read the Bible, and everyone could understand. Today we frequently encounter difficulties in new fields for the gospel; however, the early apostles had the convenience of Judaism as a bridge and medium for their preaching of the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Assistance from Greek Culture</h2>
<p>Greek culture helped the church most by providing a unified language. When I first began to serve the Lord, I encountered the problem of not having a unified language. I went from Shantung Province to Shanghai and encountered a different dialect, which made it difficult to communicate in preaching the word and prayer. It was difficult to communicate even when going to the store. After the Sino-Japanese War, the situation changed; we could speak the Mandarin dialect wherever we went&mdash;even in Hong Kong. At least seventy percent of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia can speak Mandarin Chinese; there are a few elderly ones who cannot speak it, but at least they understand it. This aids our preaching of the gospel. Although we speak different Chinese dialects, at least the different dialects have the same written form and are from the same linguistic family. Despite these similarities, however, we still have problems in communication. Imagine how difficult it would have been in the age of the apostles if writing and speech were not in one unified language. It would have been even more difficult to spread the gospel.</p>
<p>Thank the Lord for His preparation work. Before the church was produced, Greek writing and speech had become prevalent in the region around the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, when the apostles were writing the New Testament, they gave up Hebrew and used Greek. Greek was the unifying language of the peoples surrounding the Mediterranean Sea; this was a great convenience to the church. Greek was the most appropriate language for the Holy Spirit to use in developing the truth; it was more appropriate for the New Testament to be written in Greek than in Hebrew. When the early apostles went out to preach the gospel, churches were easily raised up in many localities. This was by the power of the Holy Spirit, but the Greek language was undoubtedly a help in the endeavor.</p><h2 class="head2">Assistance from Roman Politics</h2>
<p>Roman politics was a frustration and trouble to the Jews but was a great help in the spread of the church. Roman politics aided the church in the following three points.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Peace and Unity</h2>
<p>It is difficult to preach the gospel in a time of unrest. Under the iron-fisted policies of the early Roman government, the apostles were in a large realm that was safe and peaceful. Because the regions around the Mediterranean were under one governing authority, travel was safe, and there were few murders. The apostles went out to preach the gospel in safety in Asia, Rome, Spain, and Africa, because the entire Mediterranean region was under one government. If this had not been the case&mdash;if, for example, Judea had been its own little country&mdash;the church would have had no way to spread into the rest of the Roman Empire. Without the Roman Empire the church could not have spread to Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria. It would have had great difficulty in spreading to the uttermost part of the earth. The church spread quickly in the region around the Mediterranean Sea because of Roman politics.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Easy Communication</h2>
<p>In order to facilitate the movement of military supplies, the Roman Empire cared not only for shipping on the Mediterranean Sea but also for land travel. The Romans built many large, direct roads so that people could travel from Asia straight to Rome. These roads were a great convenience to travelers of that day. Thus, the apostle Paul could make three long trips to and from foreign lands. We must credit this convenience to Roman politics.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Convenient Travel</h2>
<p>Today a passport is necessary for international travel. At the time of the apostles, however, the regions around the Mediterranean Sea all belonged to the Roman Empire. This made travel convenient and safe. When Paul was defending himself before the Sanhedrin in Acts 22, he mentioned that he was a Roman citizen (v. 25); the Roman commander was therefore obligated to take good care of him. This care was a convenience given to Paul by the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Thus, Jewish religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics aided the church in a number of ways. God did a preparatory work in these three areas even before the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost. These three things are the aggregate of human culture. Human culture became a tool to assist the church once it was established on the earth at the fullness of God&rsquo;s time. The assistance given to the church enabled its rapid spread to every place. Throughout church history, God has been controlling these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HINDRANCES TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Jewish religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics assisted the church, but they also hindered it. It is difficult to calculate whether the help outweighed the hindrances. I believe that the hindrances were greater than the assistance. We may wonder why God would work in this way, but we must see that He expresses His wisdom in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Hindrances from Jewish Religion</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Persecution</h2>
<p>Even though the church was produced out of Judaism, the Jews were the first ones to persecute the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Mixture</h2>
<p>Satan used Judaism to persecute the church. However, since persecution did not destroy the church, he brought Judaism with its traditions and content into the church. This changed the nature of the church and caused it to become a mixture. Much of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s speaking in the New Testament Epistles deals with the problem of Judaism; Galatians, Philippians, and Hebrews are examples of such portions.</p>
<p>Judaism hindered the church through persecution and mixture, killing and confusion. The church is still hindered by religion in principle. Religious concepts aid the church in many ways and help in the preaching of the gospel; however, the church is frequently persecuted by religion. When persecution is unsuccessful, Satan changes his tactics, bringing religious things into the church and bringing the church into religion.</p>
<p>Therefore, religion both helps and hinders the church. Religion brings persecution and opposition and then brings mixture and confusion. Many saints still have religious concepts. For example, there are concepts concerning which style of building is suitable for a meeting place; some think that a hall should be built with high ceilings and narrow windows and should not have too much light in order to give people a sense of solemnity. The religious mind also wants an organ and other furnishings. These are religious concepts. We are not even aware how many religious concepts we hold. However, if someone has no religious concepts, it is difficult to speak to him about the things of God. Nonetheless, the convenience afforded by religious concepts always becomes a problem to the church.</p>
<p>Despite being saved, many brothers and sisters still have religious concepts. Those who opposed the Lord and the apostles were not atheists but Jews. Most of the problems in the early church did not come from the Gentiles but from the Jews. In John 16:2 the Lord said, &ldquo;An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God.&rdquo; This refers to the Jews&rsquo; persecution of the apostles. Church history illustrates this principle. Madame Guyon, John Bunyan, and Martin Luther all had problems that came from believers in the Lord. These problems are not losses to the church. Problems are different from losses. This demonstrates God&rsquo;s wisdom, because only in this way is the church preserved from being changed in nature.</p>
<p>Initially it was proper to take advantage of man&rsquo;s religious concepts in the preaching of the gospel, but later the church needed to be freed from the influence of religious concepts. A particularly strong work of Satan in the early church was to invade the church with the religious, pious concepts of Judaism; Paul&rsquo;s troubles stemmed from this source. The story is the same today. Man&rsquo;s natural, religious concepts and pious thoughts are readily accepted because they are good. However, when religious piety is brought into the church, it is equivalent to bringing in the law of good and evil from Mount Sinai. The result is trouble. Religious concepts should be shut out of the church.</p>
<p>The church is outwardly similar to religion, but the two have different natures. The principle of Judaism is outward ordinances; the principle of the church is the inward leading of the divine life. Cathedrals and melodious singing invoke solemnity and reverential behavior, but such behavior is according to the natural human concept and is religion. However, we can meet in the desert, not caring about the building or music, because the church is a matter of life and not of anything outward.</p>
<p>The persecution of the church by religion is not as bad as the mixture brought into the church by religion. Even the killing of Christians by Jewish religion was not as bad as the mixture of Judaism with the church. The danger that religion brings into the church is found in Acts 15 and 21. Even today we have natural, religious things in us.</p>
<p>It is difficult for some local churches to spread because the saints have deep religious concepts; this is the greatest hindrance to the church. The church should not fear persecution from religion but should fear mixture with religion. The church is produced out of Christ, and its nature is Christ. The church has been chosen out of the world; therefore, the church should not be mixed with the elements of the world. Throughout church history Satan&rsquo;s most devious work has been to invade the church with human things.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church came into being because elements of Judaism and Gentile religions were brought into the church. The rituals of Catholicism reflect Babylon the Great; this is Satan&rsquo;s scheme. We cannot say that we have completely escaped this influence; it is the hidden poison within the church, although it is not so evident outwardly.</p>
<p>This word is not for others; we must apply it to ourselves. If we hold on to things that are not of Christ and life but rather come from our natural piety, Satan will use us to do a work that endangers the church. At times even Paul was not clear, but God came in and spared the church from harm (Acts 21:18-26).</p>
<p>Initially, religion benefits the church, but ultimately it is a great danger. However, God protects the church and leads it in the narrow way. In principle, things such as religion, culture, and politics influence the church in a positive manner at first, but later they become hindrances. The church is pure, and it should have no element that is not of Christ, for Christ, and Christ Himself. Whatever does not match Christ is apart from Christ and does not belong to the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">ASSISTANCE AND HINDRANCES<br />
TO THE COURSE OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">The Hindrance from Greek Culture</h2>
<p>When the early church was spreading on the earth, it was mixed with Hebrew religion and Greek culture. These two sources of mixture wounded and seriously impacted the church. In the realm of human culture, Greek philosophy is very broad and deep; in particular, it explores the meaning of human life in conjunction with worshipping deities. In other words, Greek philosophy connects the meaning of human life with religion.</p>
<p>Chinese sages, such as Confucius and Mencius, focused on human life. Their philosophies have almost no connection with religious concepts. The teachings of Confucius cannot be classified as a religion because only worship of God constitutes a religion. Therefore, the teachings of the Chinese Confucian school of philosophy do not have a religious basis. Greek philosophy is different because it combines the meaning of human life with religion. Moreover, Greek philosophy absorbed the philosophies of other cultures. Elements of Egyptian, Persian, Babylonian, and even Indian culture were mixed and blended into Greek culture.</p>
<p>The special characteristic of the Greeks was that they studied new schools of thought and added the theories of other cultures to their own, incorporating them into Greek philosophy. Greek philosophy is an amalgamation of world philosophies, which made it a strong influence on the early church.</p>
<p>With regard to human life, Greek philosophy speaks of how to behave as a man, and with regard to religion, it speaks of how to worship God. The truths in the Bible emphasize man&rsquo;s relationship with God, and many of them also concern human conduct. Therefore, Greek philosophy is superficially similar to the truth of the Bible, which makes it easy for the two to be mixed together. This is why Greek philosophy was unwittingly brought into the early church. The Gentiles and even the Jews of that time were deeply influenced by Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>If a person who is steeped in Confucian philosophy is saved, it will be difficult for him not to bring his Confucian philosophy into the church. This is because some Confucian teachings, such as forgiving others and loving all men, are similar to what is taught in the Bible. In the early church, people with a background in Greek philosophy heard the gospel and received Christ. However, because they were not yet saved in their thinking, they spontaneously brought concepts from Greek philosophy into the church.</p>
<p>Church history shows that the Gnostics mixed Persian, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Greek things and came to the conclusion that there are two gods in the universe, a low-level and a high-level god. They thought that the low-level god was the god worshipped by the Jews in the Old Testament and that the dark things and physical things in the universe were created by this low-level god. Moreover, they thought that the bright things and spiritual things in the universe were created by the high-level god. They brought this philosophy into the church and also brought in many ordinances. Paul wrote Colossians in opposition to the mixture of Greek philosophy with the church and to deal with the problem of the Gnostics; the phrase <em>the elements of the world</em> in 2:8 refers to these Gentile philosophies. In reference to the trouble caused by Greek philosophy coming into the church, verse 23 says, &ldquo;Such things indeed have a reputation of wisdom in self-imposed worship and lowliness and severe treatment of the body, but are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.&rdquo; This speaking indicates some of the trouble that was caused when Greek philosophy was brought into the church.</p>
<p>Some of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, such as Galatians, deal with Judaism. Others, such as Colossians, deal with Greek philosophy. In Galatians the apostle makes it clear that the Spirit has replaced the flesh and that Christ has replaced the law. In Colossians he uses Christ, the Head of the church, to subdue Greek philosophy. In Colossians Paul also discusses the worship of the angels (2:18a), which was brought in by Greek philosophy. Those who worshipped the angels thought that man could not fellowship directly with God but that he had to pass through the hierarchy of the angels. They thought that man could directly worship only the angels. This thought is also present in Catholicism today. Nevertheless, any teaching or philosophy that departs from Christ reflects &ldquo;the elements of the world,&rdquo; not a revelation from God. The apostle used Christ to deal with both Jewish religion and Greek philosophy.</p>
<p>We need to see that human things, such as religion, literature, and philosophy, can easily be mixed into the church. Like the early apostles, we need to use Christ to subdue human philosophies and religions. As soon as religion or philosophy enters the church, Christ loses the first place. The church is a vessel to contain Christ. The church is not for religion or philosophy. Throughout church history, Satan has never ceased from his destroying work; regardless of where the church is, Satan stealthily injects the best of human philosophy into it.</p>
<p>With respect to human behavior, Confucian ethical teachings related to things like etiquette, justice, honesty, modesty, filial piety, respect for elder siblings, faithfulness, and trustworthiness are very good and have maintained the Chinese race until today. Despite the fact that China is backward in many ways, its existence today should be credited to Confucius. While the Chinese ought to respect Confucius, and while we thank the Lord for him, we recognize that his teachings are different from spiritual teachings and cannot be mingled with them. In the church there is only Christ; we should take Christ not only as our worship to God but also as our daily living. I hope the saints are not confused. When the gospel came to China, the situation was frequently confused because of a lack of light; early Chinese Christians mixed Confucian teachings with biblical truths. This was not a benefit but a loss and frustration to the church.</p>
<p>For example, prior to their salvation, we may teach our children with the words of the Bible to honor their parents, be humble, and love their neighbors as themselves. In principle, these are just like the teachings of Confucius. Since the children are not saved, they do not have the life of Christ and need to learn general principles of human conduct; however, these are not the basis of Christian teachings. Before their salvation, without the life of Christ, children must be taught principles of human conduct or else they will become wild. When they are saved and receive the life of Christ, we must use the Bible to enlighten them. Then they will see how corrupt they are and that Christ lives in them. Next, we must use the Bible to show them how to live in Christ and love God and their neighbors according to the life of Christ. Then they will realize that everything they do should not be a matter of human effort but of living Christ. This differs from Confucian teachings; this is the teaching of the church.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether precepts are from the teachings of Confucius, Mencius, or Wang Yang-ming, they teach people to develop their &ldquo;bright virtue&rdquo; in order to increase the brightness within the human heart. These precepts are in the realm of human behavior. Although they may be good, they are apart from Christ and do not contain Christ. As far as human behavior is concerned, we should keep the principles of morality and ethics, but in the church we should not merely keep moral and ethical principles. All that the church is and has is higher than human ethics and morality. Therefore, we should not only have morality and ethics, we should have Christ. The morality and ethics in the church are of God, not of man. Anything that is not of Christ or replaces Christ, even if it is good, cannot be brought into the church.</p>
<p>The church can accept only one thought and one teaching&mdash;Christ. Apart from Him, the church cannot accept any thought or teaching. If we are merely human beings, we should receive the good teachings left by the ancient sages; however, in our standing as the church, we must shut them outside the door. Our speaking in the church meetings must be Christ alone. Even good things, things that do not contradict Christ, must not be brought into the church. Bringing anything other than Christ into the church causes the church to suffer loss, because whatever is not Christ reduces the element of Christ in the church.</p>
<p>I am concerned that we do not have much feeling regarding this matter. Whoever touches God&rsquo;s feeling for the church will have a sensitivity to bringing foreign things into the Body. If we bring things that are not Christ into the church, it is a loss to the church. Even good things, things that do not contradict the teachings of the church, are a loss. The church is Christ; the church is not Judaism, Greek philosophy, or Gnostic teachings. Therefore, Paul dealt with these foreign things by presenting Christ. Many people bring their old concepts into the church and conceal them with the words of the Bible. This is a subtle and dangerous device that Satan uses to spread poisonous germs in the church.</p>
<p>This is not merely an incident in church history. We need to consider whether our concepts regarding the church are according to the heavenly pattern or our own design. The church according to our design is &ldquo;Greek philosophy.&rdquo; We should examine ourselves carefully to see how much &ldquo;Greek philosophy&rdquo; we have brought into the church. Please forgive me for saying this, but very few people are pure. Once a brother made some suggestions to me regarding how the church should be. I knew that his concepts were from &ldquo;Babylon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Egypt,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Persia,&rdquo; but I still asked him, &ldquo;What should the church be like?&rdquo; He told me that the church should establish orphanages and nursing homes and give alms to the poor; he also said that after the meetings the elders should stand at the doors to shake hands with all the brothers. In deciding whether to take such suggestions, we need to consider their source. Often the source of such suggestions is &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; or &ldquo;Greek,&rdquo; not the New Jerusalem or the heavens. These &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; or &ldquo;Greek&rdquo; suggestions do not bring in Christ.</p>
<p>It is not wrong to say that the church should care for orphans, the elderly, and the poor; however, the source of everything that the church does should be Christ. The source makes all the difference. Sometimes saints tell me their negative views concerning the responsible brothers. I ask them what they think should be done. When we deal with problems in the church, we cannot look only at what appears on the surface; rather, we must determine the source. Do the saints&rsquo; problems with the responsible brothers issue from the heavenly vision or from &ldquo;Greek philosophy&rdquo;? The two are as far removed from each other as heaven and earth. Trouble begins when we cannot discern the source.</p>
<p>With regard to human behavior, the teachings of the Chinese sages are more than sufficient. Not many Christians can compare with a person as refined as Wang Yang-ming. He was perfect in his refinement, actions, self-denial, and accuracy. Moreover, he also taught that self-refinement must originate from the heart; outward actions that do not come from the heart are like water without a spring or a tree without roots. If we read the writings of Wang Yang-ming without a clear, inward knowledge of Christ, we might decide that we do not want the Bible, or we might decide to add the teachings of the Chinese sages into it as its sixty-seventh book. May the Lord open our eyes to discern what is of man and what is of God, what is of the old creation and what is of the new creation!</p>
<p>The church issues out of God; God created the church for Christ. The church has no content other than Christ. Human things&mdash;no matter how good they are&mdash;cannot be part of the church. The issue is not whether something is good or bad but whether its source is God and its nature is Christ. During the course of the church, man has brought the best human things into the church, and this has given the church many difficulties and caused much suffering. Those who have the heavenly vision and light must admit that this mixture is a hidden problem in the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Hindrances from Roman Politics</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Persecution</h2>
<p>Early in the history of the church, the Roman Empire aided the spread of the church by providing public security and ease of travel over a good transportation system. This was a great help in building up the church. However, the Roman Empire soon began to persecute the church; we do not know how many Christians were killed by the Romans. They persecuted the church to such an extent that one Roman official reported to Caesar that the more they killed Christians, the faster Christianity spread. Historians have noted that the Romans could not continue to kill Christians because the population of the Roman Empire would have decreased dramatically. The Roman Empire passed laws to persecute and kill Christians, and it even slaughtered them in large groups. But the more the Romans persecuted the Christians, the more people believed in the Lord. The Roman Empire stirred up ten great persecutions of the church in which they killed countless Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Confusion</h2>
<p>In the fourth century, the emperor Constantine changed tactics, ended the persecution, and united the Roman Empire with the church. Thus, many elements of the Roman Empire and the church were intermixed, producing an illegal union of the church and the Roman Empire. Since the church should be the pure bride of Christ, its union with the Roman Empire was spiritual fornication; this was the fulfillment of the church in Pergamos in Revelation 2. Throughout church history the church has constantly faced this kind of problem and has shown a tendency to be mixed with politics. Not long after Constantine took the throne, Christianity became the national religion of the Roman Empire. Even today the Protestant churches are not entirely free of this mixture. When Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation, he did not bring the church out of politics; on the contrary, the church under Luther became involved with politics. Many European countries have made Christianity their state religion and have not separated the church and the state. For example, the Anglican Church is the state church of England. Politics and the church are united; this mixture is even more serious than mixture with Judaism or Greek philosophy. Thus, the church has changed in nature and lost its standing as the church. The church has fallen from the heavens to the earth and from the hands of the Holy Spirit into the hands of political authorities. This is the situation of the church today. The union of the church and politics reached its peak in Catholicism, as seen in the fact that countries send ambassadors to the Vatican.</p>
<p>To know the church in these last days, we must know Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics, all of which should not have any position in the church. Mixture changes the nature of the church and causes it to lose its standing. Bringing these three things into the church has caused the church to suffer loss.</p>
<p>By A.D. 600 the Roman Catholic Church already included these three kinds of mixture; the religion, philosophy, and politics that the apostles had driven out of the church were welcomed into the Roman Catholic Church. The apostles had driven away Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and the Roman Empire, but the Roman Catholic Church joined herself to them. Catholicism incorporates many human things. The Roman Catholic Church is the mysterious Babylon the Great. She should have been a pure woman, but she became a great harlot. This harlot mixed together God, the devil, heaven, hell, the New Testament, the Old Testament, culture, and even the Lord&rsquo;s truth; all these have been mixed together in Catholicism.</p>
<p>In Revelation 18:4 the Lord says, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people.&rdquo; Whether good or bad, the Lord wants us to discard all things that are not of Christ, because the church is just Christ. God will not allow any human thing to be mixed into the church. Even Judaism, which was treasured by His people, cannot be mixed with the church, much less other things such as politics and philosophy. Catholicism has caused the church to lose its holiness, purity, and standing and to become a roosting place for demons and the dwelling place of Satan.</p>
<p>We study church history for the sake of the church today. We are in an era of confusion, darkness, and contrasting methods; therefore, we must examine in the light the biblical revelations and types concerning the church and the course of the church on the earth. Only in this way will we see what the church is, what its standing is, and the way it should take. This is why we have taken the time to examine the nature of the church, the types of the church, and the history of the church.</p>
<p>The church is spiritual, heavenly, and of Christ; the church is pure. Anything that is not spiritual, heavenly, and of Christ should not be brought into the church. Whenever we bring human things into the church, its nature is changed, it loses its standing, and it cannot bear its responsibility. In such a situation, the church has no function before God. The church is a vessel for Christ and the Body of Christ, and everything in it is out of Christ and for Christ. Therefore, the church can only be filled with Christ Himself. This should be the condition of the church. The church is absolutely separate from the world; although it is in the world, it is not of the world. Since the church is only passing through the world, it does not have the element of the world. The church is just Christ.</p>
<p>May the Lord give us the grace that this light would become stronger and stronger. Today we are in a thick fog; may the Lord dispel the fog and cause us to see what should be the condition of the church and to see the way we should take. I hope that in the future others could also see this light and not go astray.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE TRANSMUTATION OF<br />
THE ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>The transmutation of the church refers to the church being altered in its organization and administration, that is, in its government. We may think that the organization and administration of the church did not change until Constantine accepted Christianity or until the Roman Catholic Church was formed. There is some truth to these concepts&mdash;both Constantine&rsquo;s acceptance of Christianity and the formation of the Roman Catholic Church resulted in many great changes in the church. However, the transmutation of the organization and administration of the church began prior to these two events.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CLEMENT BRINGING IN<br />
THE JEWISH ORGANIZATIONAL SYSTEM</h2>
<p>What we can glean from early church history shows that the transmutation of the church began in the second century with an epistle written by Clement, one of the elders of the church in Rome. According to Christian tradition, Clement met both Peter and Paul. He wrote a letter known as &ldquo;The Epistle of Clement&rdquo; to the church in Corinth. There are spiritual and godly words in this epistle that have helped many people. However, Clement also mentions the Judaic law with its system of organization. We cannot say that Clement was the first to bring this system into the church, but his epistle does mention it. This shows that the church was already taking the Jewish religion as a model for the organization and administration of the church. Therefore, the transmutation of the organization and administration of the church had begun by the time of Clement.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IGNATIUS ADVOCATING<br />
THAT OVERSEERS ARE OVER ELDERS</h2>
<p>Next in the historical sequence is Ignatius, who was very close to Clement. In his epistles Ignatius separates the overseers and the elders into two groups of people. In Acts 20:17 Paul sent word from Miletus to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. Verse 28 says that the Holy Spirit had placed these elders among the flock as overseers. <em>Elders</em> in verse 17 is equivalent to <em>overseers</em> in verse 28. The elders are the overseers. <em>Elder</em> refers to the person, and <em>overseer</em> refers to the function. The elders are those who are mature in life, and their function is that of overseeing. When Paul called for them to come, he referred to them as elders, but when he spoke of their function, he referred to them as overseers. Thus, elders and overseers are the same group of people; they are not two groups.</p>
<p>Ignatius, however, said that overseers, or bishops, should be over elders. He made a great mistake in separating the elders and overseers into two groups, making overseers higher than elders. This erroneous view had a serious effect on the church, and even today some denominations consider bishops, or overseers, to be higher than elders. Ignatius&rsquo;s mistaken belief was a seed sown into the church that has had a far-reaching influence on the church throughout the ages; even today this teaching has not been weeded out. Thus, the church developed a two-level organization with bishops on top and elders on the bottom. Gradually, archbishops and a pope were introduced into this hierarchy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CYPRIAN BRINGING IN A UNIFIED ORGANIZATION</h2>
<p>Cyprian, who lived in the middle of the third century, was intelligent, capable, and well-educated. He became bishop of Carthage, which was a large and highly cultured city in northern Africa on the southern shore of the Mediterranean Sea. At that time the most cultured city in northern Africa was Alexandria, but Carthage was the second most cultured city in the region. Cyprian used his position and influence to promote the view that the churches, in addition to having an episcopal hierarchy of bishops and elders, should be unified. He separated the saints into various levels according to position.</p>
<p>Although there was no pope at the time, the bishop of Rome was considered the highest among the bishops. The other bishops were not controlled by the bishop of Rome, but the consensus was that the bishop of Rome held a slightly higher position. This notion eventually led to the bishop of Rome becoming the pope. Cyprian used the term <em>catholic church</em> to refer to the universal church in the sense of one unified church for the whole world. It was another three or four centuries before the Roman Catholic Church formally came into existence, but the term <em>catholic church</em> was used in the middle of the third century.</p>
<p>By A.D. 260 the organization and administration of the church had completely veered away from the pure condition of the apostolic age. During the time of the apostles, the churches had spiritual fellowship with one another without any organizational unity. They did not control each other; the largest church did not govern the smallest church. Localities were independent and equal before God. A local church could be helped by other churches but could not be controlled by them.</p>
<p>Cyprian&rsquo;s influence complicated the later church. There were both local churches and district churches. There were elders in each local church, bishops overseeing several churches in an area, and great bishops supervising larger districts. Thus, the so-called churches were arranged into a unified organization, a catholic church. At this juncture, the organization of the church was completely transmuted.</p>
<p>Cyprian&rsquo;s central point was the unification of the church under the control of a unified episcopal system; this was his most serious proposal. From its inception on the day of Pentecost, the church was united only through the Holy Spirit, without being organized by human hands. The apostle Peter did not do such a thing, nor did the apostle Paul; none of the apostles used human hands to unify the church. After the age of the apostles, the condition of the church became confused. Around A.D. 250 Cyprian began to teach. His behavior was impeccable, and he was educated, talented, humble, and well-liked. He advocated the unification of the church, arguing that the church could not continue in a scattered, disorderly condition. In order to unify the church Cyprian created a hierarchy. He was so autocratic that anyone who did not accept his proposal was excommunicated from his catholic church.</p>
<p>Many spiritual people at that time rejected Cyprian&rsquo;s proposal. The strongest of these opponents was Novatian. Novatian genuinely knew the Lord. He was a contemporary of Cyprian who pointed out that it was an error to unify the church. Novatian said that the church should be as it was in the apostolic age, without any unifying organization. Cyprian requested that the catholic churches excommunicate Novatian and his followers. Many people stood with Novatian as a good testimony for the Lord.</p>
<p>Not all the believers supported the transmutation of the church; many people did not accept it. Furthermore, we are not the first to recognize that the church should not have a unified organization; in the third century, as the transmutation of the administration and organization of the church was occurring, some of God&rsquo;s children rose up to oppose it.</p>
<p>The transmutation of the church in administration and organization began with Clement. Satan used him to bring the Old Testament priestly system into the church. The transmutation reached its peak in the middle of the third century when Cyprian became bishop of Carthage.</p><h2 class="head1">ERRORS IN TRUTH CONCERNING<br />
BAPTISM AND SALVATION</h2>
<p>In the second century some people erroneously asserted that a person can be saved through baptism. While baptism is related to salvation, a person cannot be saved through baptism without receiving the Lord. It is wrong to teach that this is possible. However, at the end of the second century some believed that regardless of whether a person believed in the Lord, if he was baptized, he was saved. From that time on, many unsaved ones were added to the church. This went further than causing a transmutation in administration and organization; it resulted in a transmutation of the basic constituents of the church. In the beginning the constituents of the church were the Lord and those who had His life; it consisted only of those who were saved, not unsaved ones. The transmutation of the constituents of the church is significant because it resulted in confusion.</p>
<p>In Taiwan we have baptized many newly saved ones. In principle, we have not done anything wrong, but in the details we have neglected something. I believe that some have been baptized without being saved, because the pre-baptism interviews were not conducted carefully enough. We did not determine whether the candidates for baptism had really contacted Christ. Baptizing unsaved people into the church causes mixture in the constituents of the church.</p>
<p>We should not baptize unsaved ones into the church; therefore, although the pre-baptism interviews are not that demanding, we must use them to touch the spirit of the candidates. The social class of those whom we baptize does not matter, but whether they have been regenerated is a real concern. Those who have not been regenerated should not be baptized into the church, or the church will suffer loss. Before the end of the second century the heresy of salvation through baptism was already prevailing in the church. Because of this erroneous practice, many unsaved ones came into the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRODUCING OF A MEDIATORIAL CLASS</h2>
<p>In the second and third centuries some people thought that not everyone was qualified to break the bread and distribute the cup during the Lord&rsquo;s table&mdash;only a special group of people could do this. Therefore a distinction developed between those who were regarded as the clergy and the laity. During the time of Cyprian, this distinction became the standard rule of the catholic church. Only a special group of people who attended to matters of service to God could distribute the bread and the cup. Thus, Christian priests were produced. The priestly system of Judaism was formally transferred into the church.</p>
<p>Therefore, the organization, administration, and constituents of the church were transmuted before the end of the third century. This transmutation continues in Christianity today&mdash;the constituents of the church are mixed, its administration is hierarchical, and its organization is unified. It is entirely different from the church on the day of Pentecost and from what was practiced in the early church. The constituents of the church on the day of Pentecost included only saved ones, its administration was local and without hierarchy, and its organization was not unified, federated, or catholic. On the day of Pentecost the constituents of the church were regenerated people, the administration of the church was local, and the church was not unified organizationally.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONSTANTINE MIXING POLITICS WITH THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>By the time of Cyprian the administration and organization of the church had been completely transmuted, but the church had not yet been mixed with human government. Although there had been a transmutation, the church was still separate from human government. At Cyprian&rsquo;s time human government still persecuted the church. Several of those who were responsible for the transmutation of the organization of the church were even persecuted and martyred for the Lord. The Roman Empire persecuted the church through the end of the third century, that is, for at least two hundred and fifty years.</p>
<p>In A.D. 312 Constantine began his reign over the Roman Empire. Not long after he ascended to the throne, he accepted Christianity. Originally the Roman Empire persecuted Christianity, but after Constantine accepted Christianity, the Roman Empire changed its tactics. It not only ceased its persecution of the church but also began to welcome and exalt Christianity. Constantine accommodated Christianity and encouraged Roman citizens to participate in it. He introduced elements of Christianity into his government and also extended his political power into Christianity. Constantine even took advantage of the archbishops in order to increase his power, which resulted in a further mixture of the church and the Roman Empire.</p>
<p>Constantine interfered a great deal in the matters of the church, even appointing some bishops. He presided over the Council of Nicea that is so famous in church history. There were approximately three hundred bishops present at the council. Constantine sat on a throne of pure gold and observed the debate among the bishops. He favored the orthodox group, that is, Athanasius and his followers, by constantly siding with them. Thus, the Council of Nicea ordained a creed that supported the pure faith. Nevertheless, Constantine meddled in church affairs. After his reign, emperors had the power to send bishops away or recall them; the bishops were under the power of the emperor. Therefore, politics entered the church, and the church entered politics.</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s influence on the church resulted in an alliance between the church and politics. Prior to Constantine, the church had not been involved in politics, although it had been transmuted. After Constantine, the church was united with a government&mdash;the Roman Empire. Constantine&rsquo;s reign marked the beginning of Pergamos. The word <em>pergamos</em> has two meanings: &ldquo;high tower&rdquo; and &ldquo;marriage union.&rdquo; Because Constantine accepted Christianity into the Roman Empire, the church became a high tower; in the same way, the church was also married to the world. After its marriage to the world, the transmutation of the church was complete.</p>
<p>Constantine&rsquo;s acceptance of Christianity strengthened and increased the transmutation. Since then, the transmutation has continually gained strength and spread. By the fifth century, when the Roman Catholic Church became quite prevailing, the transmutation of the organization and administration of the church reached its peak and could not get any worse.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO TRENDS DURING THE PROCESS<br />
OF TRANSMUTATION</h2>
<p>At the time of Constantine, the transmutation of the church was complete. However, two trends which began during the process of transmutation have continued throughout church history. The first trend is that there has always been a group of spiritual individuals who do not accept the transmutation; the other trend is that those who promote the transmutation believe that they are defending the truth.</p>
<p>Those who promote transmutation claim that it protects the truth; none of them believe that they are speaking heresy. They believe that their actions are in accordance with the truth; whether they are actually in accordance with the truth is another matter.</p>
<p>For example, Cyprian was capable in expounding the Scriptures and believed that he held to the truth. Later, the Roman Catholic Church killed those who followed the leading of the Holy Spirit to oppose the transmutation; the Roman Catholic Church claimed that it was keeping the truth in killing these Christians. Even today, in all his statements and actions, the Pope says that he is acting according to the truth. Although many Christian groups have veered off the proper course, they defend themselves by saying that they are keeping the truth. Despite the fact that they left the truth, they will not admit that they are wrong. These groups have lost the pure, simple nature of the truth and become a complicated and abnormally large mixture.</p>
<p>Matthew 13:31-32 indicates that the church should be a small mustard plant, but shows that it has been transmuted into a great tree. The church, according to its nature, should be like a mustard plant, tender and small. For example, when Paul and Peter passed away, they did not leave a legacy of Paul or Peter &ldquo;the great.&rdquo; However, the marriage of the church to the world caused many things to become &ldquo;great.&rdquo; Now there are &ldquo;great trees&rdquo; all around, and the church&rsquo;s greatest fear is that it would not be even greater; these are symptoms of the transmutation. Although the church in Jerusalem baptized several thousand believers at one time in Acts 2 and 4, it did not become a &ldquo;great tree&rdquo; as a result. Only after Constantine accepted Christianity was the transmutation of the church fully manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FORMATION OF<br />
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2>
<p>When Constantine accepted Christianity, the church had not yet been transmuted into the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic Church was not fully formed until A.D. 500 or 600. The formation of the Roman Catholic Church was the expansion of the transmutation; the church gradually became more transmuted until the Roman Catholic Church was formed. In other words, the Roman Catholic Church did not come about suddenly but was formed over a period of four hundred years out of the seeds sown at the time of Clement.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE</h2>
<p>Before the end of the third century, the organization, administration, and basic constituents of the church were transmuted. Therefore, today we must reject all aspects of the transmutation. We cannot allow unsaved ones into the church, we stand against classes in the church, we stand against an organizational unification of the church, and we stand against bishops and overseers being above the elders.</p>
<p>The church must be simple and pure, without such things as a mediatorial class or hierarchy. The churches in all the localities should keep their administration local; they should not be unified organizationally. Among the churches in Taiwan, for example, the church in Taipei is not a higher-level church. The level of spiritual attainment among the churches may be different, but they are all of the same class. The churches have one testimony and one fellowship in the Lord, but they do not have one organization. The churches may have one move, but they should not form a unified organization with a united move. We need to take responsibility for these matters; otherwise, we will soon veer from the course. As soon as we cease to be watchful, we will easily go astray. The constituting element of the church should be simple; the church can be constituted only with saved persons, those who contact God and have the Lord&rsquo;s life. The administration of the church should not have classes or hierarchy, and the organization of the church should not be unified. The church should not be a catholic church, nor should all the churches on the earth be unified; the churches should be entirely local. Unification is an error; we should not and cannot unify.</p>
<p>If the Lord delays His coming and allows His church to continue for another period of history, I hope that these words<br />
will stand as a testimony to condemn every aspect of the transmutation. At the same time, I hope that we would be clear so that our words, actions, behavior, and decisions would not violate this basic principle: We should hold only to what the church had at the very beginning, and we should reject anything that is altered or transmuted.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE UNION OF THE CHURCH AND POLITICS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNION OF<br />
THE CHURCH AND POLITICS<br />
UNDER CONSTANTINE</h2>
<p>The union of the church and politics is the union of the church and human government. Originally the church was apart from the world. Although it was in the world, the church had no relationship with the world. Church history shows that Judaism and Greek culture were brought into the church; this troubled the church.</p>
<p>The transmutation of the church in administration and organization began with the Judaic system, methods, and priesthood, a group of specialists in serving God, being brought into the church. While Greek culture influenced the church, its impact was not as damaging as Judaism. Judaism took root in the church, damaging the life of the church and dealing it a severe blow.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire persecuted the church throughout the first three centuries. In the fourth century the Roman Empire changed its attitude, no longer persecuting the church but welcoming it and giving it a special position. This change in attitude began after Constantine became the emperor of Rome. Although he was not baptized until he was on his deathbed, he welcomed Christianity. He used many methods to encourage the populace to reject pagan religions and embrace Christianity. He did this not for God but to solidify his own political power. The real issue of this history is the effect that the Roman Empire&rsquo;s acceptance of Christianity had on the spiritual condition of the church.</p>
<p>After Constantine died, his sons still favored Christianity. Later, a few emperors opposed Christianity, but most of them accepted and supported it. During Constantine&rsquo;s reign, Christianity was not yet the official state religion. Christianity was not declared the official state religion until the reign of Theodosius I in A.D. 380. At that time all Roman citizens were required to become Christians. Later, Theodosius ordered the destruction of all idol temples in the empire and the abolishment of all pagan religions. Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, and the church was completely united with the Roman government. This was not a small matter.</p>
<p>The transmutation of the organization and administration of the church began with Clement around A.D. 100; it continued from that time, growing worse and worse until A.D. 312, when Constantine united the church with the Roman Empire. The union of the church and the Roman Empire completed the transmutation of the administration and organization of the church. It was about two hundred and eighty years from the day of Pentecost (in approximately A.D. 34) to the church&rsquo;s complete transmutation in administration and organization. The system of bishops was instituted in approximately A.D. 250. At that time, as bishop of Carthage, Cyprian wrote letters teaching and requiring others to accept that the system of bishops should be practiced in the church.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s work to ruin, damage, defile, disturb, and confuse the church did not stop with the system of bishops. When the bishops were introduced, the church was not yet united with the Roman government. The Roman Empire did not fully change its attitude toward the church until A.D. 320. About sixty years later, the Roman Empire formally adopted Christianity as its official religion. This completed the union of the church with the world. While it may seem that the church had gained the victory and that the Roman Empire was under its hand, in reality, the world was united with the church, and the world had come into the church. The mixture of the church with the world caused the church to lose its pure nature. The church and the Roman Empire were united to such an extent that it was almost as if the church was the Roman Empire and the Roman Empire was the church. The Roman emperors even appointed some unbaptized men as bishops. Since then the church has never escaped this mixture with politics; the problem has gotten worse and worse.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, God does not intervene in this age to deal with things that defile the church. For example, with regard to the transmutation of the administration of the church, we think that it would be good if God would intervene to correct the transmuted condition. However, God does not intervene but allows the transmutation to continue and even to worsen. With regard to the union of the church and the world, we might think that God should intervene to stop such a union, but He does not intervene at all; He allows it to happen. From the Middle Ages onward, European history is a matter of the union of politics with religion. The two are completely intertwined. Sometimes the church is the stronger of the two, and sometimes the political power is greater. Moreover, all the corrupt things in the world&mdash;idols, deceitfulness, power struggles, scheming, uncleanness, fame, and lust for position&mdash;can all be found in the church. This fulfills the Lord&rsquo;s word in the epistle to the church in Pergamos in Revelation 2; the church is truly married to the world.</p>
<p>Thus, the church is not only in desolation; it is also corrupted. The world has been brought into the church; this is a great matter in the course of the church. By A.D. 400 the church was thoroughly corrupted; however, not everyone in the church participated in the corruption. There are many examples in church history of ones who loved the Lord and did not take part in the corruption; they did not want a transmuted church, and they did not approve of the union of the church with human government. Although these were few in number, they loved the Lord with a pure heart and followed Him faithfully, never accepting the corrupted and transmuted condition of the church. They stood apart from the corruption and transmutation; thus, they were not part of the unified, catholic church. Rather, they were excommunicated from the catholic church. This line of overcomers has continued unbroken throughout church history.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BECOMING<br />
THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2>
<p>We may wonder when the Roman Catholic Church began. If we trace its roots, it is evident that it began with Clement. In the second century he brought the Jewish priestly system into the church; this system of priests was like a seed sown in the church. This seed of corruption and error operated within the church until approximately A.D. 250, when Cyprian was bishop of Carthage. Cyprian promoted a hierarchy dividing the bishops from the other clergy beneath them. This hierarchical organization was formed into a unified church called the catholic church. This catholic church was not yet the Roman Catholic Church. When the government of the Roman Empire was mixed with the catholic church, the catholic church began to look more like the Roman Catholic Church. The formal beginning of the Roman Catholic Church dates from when the highest bishop was designated as the pope. At that juncture the church had a pope and archbishops; under the archbishops were the bishops, and under the bishops were the priests. Each locality had priests, several localities were combined into a district under a bishop, and several districts were combined into a large district under an archbishop.</p>
<p>After politics and religion were united, the Roman Empire was divided into five large religious regions. Each region had a patriarch; thus, there were a total of five patriarchs. Each religious region had a central city, and each central city had a patriarch. The patriarchs were situated in Rome (Europe), Alexandria (North Africa), Constantinople (Near East), Antioch (Asia Minor), and Jerusalem (Palestine). These five regions surrounded the Mediterranean Sea and covered all the areas under the jurisdiction of the Roman Empire. The five patriarchs tacitly acknowledged that the patriarch of Rome had the highest rank, but they did not have authority to govern one another. Although there was not yet a pope, there were power struggles among the patriarchs.</p>
<p>In A.D. 590 Gregory I, also known as Gregory the Great, became patriarch of Rome. Gregory was talented and a good politician, and his heart was to elevate the position of Rome. Thus, he required the other patriarchs to acknowledge his supreme authority. He advocated that Rome should be above all other places because Peter had gone to Rome. Peter was the successor of Christ; therefore, the patriarch of Rome was the successor of Peter. People began to call Gregory &ldquo;Pope,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Father&rdquo; or &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo; The Chinese translation of the word <em>pope</em> is <em>jiao huang,</em> meaning &ldquo;religious emperor.&rdquo; This is how the office of the pope came into being. The five religious regions split over this issue, with the four in the East standing against Rome in the West. Although the four eastern regions did not submit to Rome, Rome still wielded power because it was the capital of the Roman Empire. However, the patriarch of Constantinople never submitted to Rome, and in the eleventh century it separated to form the Eastern Roman Church, or the Eastern Greek Church. The Eastern Roman Church later became the Eastern Orthodox Church.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church was fully formed by the end of the sixth century. The popes who succeeded Gregory the Great set in place the Roman organization, system, practices, and authority. As far as the church is concerned, they were corrupt to the uttermost. The corrupt things&mdash;such as heresies, customs of the nations, and worldly power&mdash;were much worse under the popes than they had been when the church was first joined to the world. In the early stages of the union of the church and the world, worldly customs entered the church in an informal way, not an official way. After the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, the popes officially recognized many worldly traditions, which they decreed that all the churches in the world had to obey. Thus, the traditions were authorized. After the Roman Empire accepted Christianity as its official religion, many Roman customs were brought into the Roman church. For example, Roman feast days were brought into the church, and unregenerated Romans became members of the church. The early Roman church took unsaved people, who enjoyed celebrating pagan festivities, sprinkled them with water, and made them members of the church. Similarly, the Chinese like to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-autumn Moon Festival. Since they are accustomed to celebrating these festivals, when the time comes for the Mid-autumn Moon Festival, they eat moon cakes.</p>
<p>Even though I grew up in a somewhat Christian household, we would still write a Chinese couplet and New Year&rsquo;s greetings on sheets of red paper and paste them on our door every Chinese New Year. Some people were so accustomed to celebrating Chinese New Year that it was difficult to tell whether they were saved, because every Chinese New Year they would hang couplets on their doors. I clearly remember one set of couplets, which said, &ldquo;Glory in heaven to God; / Peace on earth to men.&rdquo; They were celebrating a worldly festival, but their couplets were written with words from the Bible.</p>
<p>After the Roman Empire accepted Christianity as its official religion and the church was united with politics, the citizens of the Roman Empire brought their customs into the church. The goddess Artemis, whom they worshipped, became the &ldquo;holy mother&rdquo; Mary; Artemis is the Greek name for Diana in the Roman myths. The festival day for the worship of the sun was called the birthday of Christ and became Christmas. These customs had come into the church prior to the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, but people did not pay much attention to them. However, once the office of the pope was introduced, the popes officially recognized these customs and ordered the whole church to follow them. Thus, goddess worship became an officially recognized matter. The legend of Mary&rsquo;s ascent into heaven was merely a legend in the catholic church, but once the pope officially recognized it, it had an official standing. A Catholic today who says that Mary did not ascend into heaven is a rebellious person, because the pope has officially proclaimed that Mary was taken up into heaven.</p>
<p>In 1854 Pope Pius IX issued a papal bull proclaiming that Mary was without sin; this is the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. According to this teaching, when Mary conceived of the Holy Spirit, she escaped from original sin. After the pope made this declaration, all Roman Catholics had to agree that Mary was without sin. Once Pius IX officially recognized this doctrine, it was legally binding. The popes also officially confirmed the worship of the apostle Paul. Every one of the so-called Catholic saints has been canonized by the pope. For example, the pope canonized St. Francis of Assisi. All the members of the Catholic Church must keep whatever the popes officially proclaim, even if it is sinful. Whoever does not keep these things is considered to be in rebellion. What a corrupt situation!</p>
<p>A man named Alexander Hislop spent much time to study the mystery of Babylon the Great, and he put the results of his research into a thick book called <em>The Two Babylons.</em> Hislop&rsquo;s book exposes the hidden, dark, and corrupt things of Catholicism. The Roman Catholic Church is truly a mystery with many things hidden inside. We do not need to examine the entire history of the Roman Catholic Church to see that it has no life or light and is in darkness and corruption&mdash;we can simply look at the Roman Catholic Church in Manila.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Manila, I thought it was very strange that the Catholics would carry a statue of Mary in a parade, with two lines of people following behind holding candles. They would dress up a young girl as a queen, and she would march in the middle of these lines. There also would be a group of young men among them as kings; they also would march in lines in the parade. How can this be worship to God? It is hard to believe that the church has been transmuted to such an extent that it has no life at all and is entirely wicked. I do not want to say too much, and I hope we would not have a critical attitude, but this situation should break our heart.</p>
<p>When I was in Manila, on the night of a feast re-enacting the so-called Passion, someone would dress up as a suffering Jesus. Some people would beat him with whips while others around him would weep. Many of these people were habitual criminals; some were members of gangs who cheated people and extorted their money, and others were pickpockets and thieves. These criminals would also come out to weep and shout. Moreover, I learned that some Filipinos were wealthy, but their consciences were convicted because their money came from illegal sources. As they were dying, they would beg their children to use some of their money to buy masses for them in order to atone for their sins. This is not slander; these things are factual.</p>
<p>The church has been completely transmuted. It is altogether different in its organization and administration than it was in the beginning. Spiritually speaking, it is no longer the church, because the heavenly, spiritual nature of Christ is completely gone. In the Roman Catholic Church we may not be able to find even one saved person among a hundred of its members. It is difficult to adequately describe the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church as recorded in Revelation 17:5: &ldquo;MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.&rdquo; The Roman Catholic Church is truly a great harlot on the earth.</p>
<p>Our goal is not to criticize the mistakes of others. Our goal is to see the course of the church on the earth. I hope that God would open our eyes to see the things that should be in the church and the things that are filthy and corrupt, to see the things that were originally in the church and the things which were not originally in the church. We must humble ourselves before the Lord, receive mercy, follow Him in a lowly manner, and walk in the way that He has ordained for His church in this age.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">MAJOR GROUPS WITHIN CHRISTIANITY</h1>
<p>During the process in which the church became the Roman Catholic Church, strong distinctions developed among the various groups within the church. The transmutation of the organization of the church began from when Bishop Clement suggested that the system of the Jewish priesthood be brought into the church. Once the transmutation started, those in the church who lived before the Lord began to differ from the majority in their thought. Those who went along with the transmutation gained more and more power, while those who stood against the transmutation became small and hidden before God; they lived before God, serving Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CATHOLIC CHURCH</h2>
<p>Those who accepted the transmuted organization of the church organized themselves into the catholic church in approximately A.D. 250, when Cyprian was bishop of Carthage in northern Africa. The catholic church united all the churches in the world, and the word <em>catholic</em> is still used by the Roman Catholic Church to indicate that the entire world is unified.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURE IN HEART</h2>
<p>Many people who lived before the Lord separated themselves from the catholic church. Although there were sects within the church, there were no major divisions. However, after the catholic church was formed, the sectarianism within the church was clearly manifested, and two lines developed within Christianity. The catholic church, because of its organization and methods, was easily utilized by the Roman government. Thus, the catholic church continually gained status and power.</p>
<p>In contrast, those who stood apart from the catholic church had a pure heart for the Lord. They rejected the world to follow the Lord in a simple way and to live a pure life before Him. Their stand for the Lord distinguished them not only from those in the catholic church but also from most people in society; therefore, these pure-hearted believers were not welcomed by human society, and history records very little concerning them. These hidden people lived before the Lord, did not announce themselves to outsiders, and did not live according to the fashion of the day. This made them unwelcome in society, and few people paid attention to them. Secular historians naturally ignored them.</p>
<p>Because most early church historians were members of the Roman Catholic Church, they did not mention those who served the Lord out of a pure heart. The Roman Catholic Church tried to destroy any books written by those who were pure in heart; therefore, few records have been left to us by the pure-hearted ones. However, from the little we have, it is clear that they testified boldly for the Lord even though the Roman Catholic Church frustrated and persecuted them. After that there were two major groups within Christianity&mdash;the high-class, powerful Roman Catholic Church and the lowly, hidden, pure-hearted believers.</p>
<p>When Constantine came to power, he united Christianity with the Roman government. This union was with the so-called catholic church; at that time no other organization or group could match the splendor and power of the catholic church. Later, even the emperors had to kneel before the archbishops and kiss their hands in a gesture of respect and honor. This shows that the catholic church was highly respected.</p>
<p>In such a situation the believers who were pure in heart were troubled both by the Roman government and the catholic church. In general, the Roman government at that time was not opposed to Christianity; on the contrary, it welcomed Christianity. However, the Roman government troubled the pure-hearted Christians because it was united with the catholic church. Although the Roman government could influence the catholic church, the catholic church could also influence the government. Because the catholic church was against the pure-hearted believers, the Roman government stood with the catholic church and followed it to oppose them.</p>
<p>Thus, although the Roman government accepted Christianity, which it had formerly opposed, its acceptance was conditional. They welcomed the Christians who were in the catholic church but not those who were pure in heart. Therefore, the two groups of Christians were clearly divided. One group was the unified catholic church with its rigid organizational system, and the other group consisted of scattered believers without any organization, those who were pure in heart. This separation was primarily in the matter of organization. In the organization of the catholic church, the patriarchs were in the highest position. The position of the pope developed out of the patriarchal system. Originally, there were five patriarchs, one in Rome in the West and four in the East&mdash;in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria. The four patriarchs in the East took the patriarch of Constantinople as their head; each patriarch governed an administrative district that was composed of several provinces. The patriarch of Rome had many clergy under him; these clergymen were called cardinals and had the authority to elect the patriarch. These cardinals later became the seven cardinal bishops in the Roman Catholic Church. Each patriarch had several archbishops under him; each archbishop governed an archdiocese. Each diocese had a governing bishop, and in the bishop&rsquo;s absence, the monsignors stood in for him. The monsignors were chief elders who would chair the meetings. Under the monsignors were the deacons, the lowest ones in the hierarchy. This was the organization of the catholic church that tried to unify all the churches on the earth.</p>
<p>However, the pure-hearted believers did not want a unification of the whole earth, and they did not accept the hierarchy. Thus, they began to have their own separate meetings. The catholic church excommunicated the pure-hearted believers, accusing them of preaching heresy. From then on, there were two clear lines among Christians. One line was organized and visible, enjoying a high status in the world; the other line was hidden, without any organization, having been rejected by the world. These two lines have continued to this day.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GREEK CHURCH</h2>
<p>The division of the catholic church between the East and the West eventually also developed into two distinct lines. The first was in the West with Rome as its chief city; the churches allied with Rome were called the Latin or the Roman Church. The second was in the East, in the Greek region, with Constantinople as its chief city; the churches allied with Constantinople were called the Greek Church.</p>
<p>Later, the Roman church developed into the Roman Catholic Church, which was very powerful. The Greek church developed into the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church. From a very early time Russia accepted Eastern Greek Orthodoxy as its national religion. Most of northeastern Europe as well as western Asia also adopted the Eastern Greek Orthodox religion. These two major sects of the East and the West have never been rejoined, and they have even attacked each other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NESTORIANS</h2>
<p>The Nestorians were an offshoot of the eastern branch of the catholic church. Despite the fact that they were few in number, the Nestorians did have some power. Nestorianism was preached in China, and in Chinese history it is called the Ching Religion. The founder of Nestorianism was Nestorius, a talented, well-educated theologian. He was the patriarch of Constantinople. His theology concerning the Person of the Triune God differed from the theology of the catholic church and from the creeds that are used in most of Christianity today. Today the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church, and all the denominations use creeds. The main point of the creeds is as follows: &ldquo;I believe in the Triune God; I believe that Jesus Christ was born of Mary, and that He died on the cross for me.&rdquo; This is the basic faith.</p>
<p>In A.D. 431 at the Council of Ephesus, it was agreed that such a creed was correct. Later, Nestorius taught differently from the creed; his teachings&mdash;especially his teachings concerning the Person of the Lord Jesus&mdash;had the flavor of heresy to other Christians. However, because he was a talented, educated man with much influence, many people followed him. Because his teachings differed from the creeds, a council of the catholic church excommunicated him. He left Constantinople and went to Persia, which is modern-day Iran. It is said that even today there are churches which descended from the Nestorians in Iran.</p>
<p>The Nestorians spread to the East, and during the Tang Dynasty they reached China. At that time, Nestorianism in China, the Ching Religion, was centered in Changan, which is modern-day Xian in the Shaanxi Province. According to Chinese history, the Ching Religion flourished and was received by many of the nobles in the emperor&rsquo;s court. A Nestorian tablet found in Xian refers to the Ching Religion thriving during the Tang Dynasty; there were more than three hundred Ching temples in China. This proves that Nestorianism was very powerful in China during the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>However, because the Nestorians relied on scholarship to spread their religion and did not bring many people to know the Lord or receive His life, they fell into outward religious activity without anything of life. Thus, when a new dynasty replaced the Tang dynasty, some of its emperors did not like this foreign religion and issued edicts restricting its spread. This forced many nuns and monks to give up their vocation and return to the world. In a very short time Nestorianism disappeared from China. However, one sect of Nestorians spread to India; thus, the oldest group of Christians in India is the Nestorians.</p>
<p>The organized church by this time was divided into two large sects and one small sect. The two large sects were the Roman Catholic Church in the West and the Greek Orthodox Church in the East. The small sect was the Nestorians. These three sects had nearly identical systems of organization, and their methods of worship were similar. The main difference was that the Nestorians had a different creed; the two large sects had creeds that were according to the truth, and they considered the Nestorians to be heretics.</p>
<p>The seventh and eighth centuries were the golden age of Nestorianism. All of Persia was Nestorian, and east of Persia, all Christians were Nestorian. Thus, Christianity around A.D. 700 was divided into four main groups: the Western church, the Eastern church, the Nestorians, and the believers with pure hearts for the Lord. The pure-hearted believers did not have any organization; they simply met in one accord in each locality and served the Lord. By the end of the fifteenth century, the Nestorians had almost disappeared, but the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches had become more and more powerful.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROTESTANTS</h2>
<p>The eleventh and twelfth centuries were the darkest period in the history of Christianity. The power of the Roman Catholic Church had grown to the uttermost. The Eastern Greek Orthodox Church was also powerful, but it was not as strong as the Roman Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic popes were more powerful than at any other time in their history; they established almost all the kings and emperors of Europe. In such a situation a fifth group was produced in the sixteenth century, the Reformation, or Protestant, sect. Protestantism began with Martin Luther. This group gained strength rapidly and included many people. The Protestants were not confined to one country; rather, many people all over Europe took action simultaneously to produce Protestantism.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century Christianity was divided into five main groups. The Nestorians, however, were by that time only a scattered remnant. Thus, the remaining four groups were the Roman Catholic Church, the Greek Orthodox Church, the Protestant churches, and those with pure hearts. Within these four main groups, there were many smaller groups. The Roman Catholic Church is not truly universal; there are many sects of Catholicism. Although they recognize and take their orders from one pope, in practice they are very different and constantly criticize and attack one another. They wear different clothes and pray different prayers. Some nuns let their hair grow, and others shave their heads; their veils and the color of their habits vary as well. The Catholic sects separate themselves rigidly from one another; some emphasize scholarship, and others are interested only in works. There are hundreds of variations, so it is difficult to enumerate all of them.</p>
<p>The Greek Orthodox Church is also divided into sects, but there are fewer Orthodox sects than Catholic sects. The strongest Catholic sect is the Jesuits. In Protestantism there are more than two thousand sects today, although some conservatively estimate that there are only several hundred sects. In Baguio in the Philippines, we met an American missionary who said he was from the Church of the Nazarene; we had not heard of that group. This shows that we do not know the number of sects in Protestantism.</p>
<p>The pure-hearted believers are also divided into numerous scattered sects. Thus, even they are no longer pure-hearted. This is like the time of the Judges when there was no king in Israel and everyone did what was right in his own eyes; it is almost to the point where the situation of the church is so confused that anyone can establish his own group. It is proper to oppose organization, but it is wrong to be so loose and free.</p>
<p>Not long after we came to Taiwan, we saw a sign that read &ldquo;Christian Family Meeting.&rdquo; After a few days we saw that someone had established a &ldquo;church&rdquo; in another place. When we spoke with these groups, they both declared that they did not want organized Christianity and only desired to serve God according to the Bible.</p>
<p>Some scholars of church history would classify such groups with the pure-hearted believers; some have even been called Puritans. However, these groups are scattered. Some believers are &ldquo;pure&rdquo; to such an extent that they reject everything. They do not set up churches or join any church; rather, they stay at home reading the Bible, praying, and worshipping God. There are many such ones in Taipei and Tokyo. They have a clean, pious living, and read the Bible, pray, and preach the gospel. It is difficult to speak about the church with them because they think that all Christian groups are wrong and have problems; therefore, they do not want any church. Today the church is in a very divided condition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER STANDING</h2>
<p>As Christians, with which group should we stand? We must belong to a group, unless we are not Christians. If we are Christians, we must be in a group.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church today is powerful in terms of money, scholarship, position, and influence; Catholics study every area of knowledge, including education, science, and politics. They have a grasp of modern human society&rsquo;s psychology of education. Modern man wants to be educated; even the poor want an education. It seems that the future of human life is based on education, and those who are not educated have no future. The Catholics run excellent schools, from elementary through secondary school to the university level. Their principals, vice-principals, teachers, and professors are all specialists. Thus, people are willing to be educated by them. Once young people are among them, the Catholics use every available method to entice and encourage them to join the Roman Catholic Church. If a student converts to Catholicism, his education will be more convenient in terms of his grades and the treatment he receives.</p>
<p>In the Philippines some brothers and sisters among us graduated from Catholic schools. It was very difficult for them to graduate because they were not Catholics. Almost all the people who study in the Catholic schools eventually become Catholics; the Roman Catholic Church gains students as they study at their schools. This has continued from generation to generation. The graduates of Catholic schools are usually Catholic. To the Roman Catholic Church, it does not matter whether they are true or false believers as long as they are Catholic in name.</p>
<p>In addition to their schools, the Roman Catholic Church also has a specially trained group of people who work to gain talented students and rich families. Those in their schools who are good students or come from rich families are unable to escape once they are noticed. The priests and lay brothers have received special training to gain such young people through particular care. Their love, care, and sympathy toward these young people are for the purpose of gaining their heart so that they also might become priests. In order to gain young girls, the nuns love and care for the female students to such an extent that they even trim the girls&rsquo; fingernails. They love and care for them to such an extent that almost all the young girls consecrate themselves.</p>
<p>This is not loose speaking; there are many cases in which these things happened. Everyone has emotions, and the Catholics&rsquo; heart to care for and sympathize with people is much better than ours. It is not surprising that people cannot escape them, and many young people become priests and nuns. On the other hand, they care for gaining only the rich. Statistically, after World War I a third of the world&rsquo;s wealth was in Rome; thus, a third of the world&rsquo;s wealth was in the Roman Catholic Church. Another third was in the hands of the Jews. The concentration of wealth in the Roman Catholic Church has only increased. Revelation 17 through 19 speaks of &ldquo;MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT&rdquo;; God calls, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people, that you do not participate in her sins&rdquo; (18:4). This shows that she is very great. Of course, we should not neglect the fact that in the Roman Catholic Church there are a small number of saved, godly people.</p>
<p>Where should Christians serve the Lord today? In the Roman Catholic Church? In the Greek Orthodox Church? In Nestorianism or Protestantism? With those who have a pure heart for the Lord? No one can escape the issue of sects, because Christianity is divided and has no way to unite. There are genuine believers and godly people in every major sect. We must consider where we should be. The scholarly writers of church history would undoubtedly rank us among the pure in heart. Although we are not a sect, they would classify us as a sect. This is the situation, and we cannot avoid it. The only way to escape classification is to not be a Christian; as Christians, we must fall into one of the five major classifications.</p>
<p>Many years ago in Nanking, a member of the Uigur tribe from the Sinkiang Province heard the gospel and received the Lord. Later, he told us that his mother and aunts were Christians. His aunt met in a church without a name or a pastor; when they came together to meet and sing hymns, it seemed as if no one was leading. The only way he could describe their meetings was to say, &ldquo;It is almost like your meetings here.&rdquo; This shows that in faraway Sinkiang Province a group of people who love the Lord with a pure heart has been raised up.</p>
<p>We may think that we go to remote areas to preach the gospel because the people in those areas have not heard the name of Jesus. However, this is not correct. The people there have not only heard the name of Jesus, but there are some among them who have a pure heart to worship God according to the Bible. God has many hidden works that are not publicized and are unknown to us. I deeply feel that these hidden, pure-hearted believers are taking the right way before the Lord. The responsible brothers in each locality should be in fear and trembling before the Lord, because being hidden is always better than being exposed.</p>
<p>Although we cannot avoid the matter of sects, we must absolutely keep ourselves from being sectarian. We are different from the sects, but we should not argue with people about who is a sect and who is not. It is foolish to do such a thing. We must seriously ask the Lord where we should be in light of the degraded condition of the church in this age. We should be among the hidden believers who are pure in heart. We should not hope for a universal church; the Lord is not looking for this. A universal church is not our commission. Our only responsibility is to learn to be pure-hearted believers before the Lord, not making a display of ourselves and not becoming involved with any movement but, instead, simply serving the Lord in a hidden way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<p>After the church had been transmuted and became the Roman Catholic Church, in a sense it could not be transmuted or fall any further. Whatever could be transmuted had been transmuted, whatever could fall had fallen, and whatever could be corrupted had been corrupted. The Roman Catholic Church is the best illustration of the church after it fell to the uttermost. When people or situations are corrupted to the uttermost, everything is finished. For example, a sick person dies when his sickness reaches the extreme; everything is finished&mdash;he cannot get any sicker. With the formation of the Roman Catholic Church, the transmutation and degradation of the church were complete. Thus, the church could not be further transmuted or fall any lower.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF JUSTIFICATION BY FAITH</h2>
<p>In A.D. 590, when Gregory the Great established the papal throne, the Roman Catholic Church was fully established in the world. It was more than nine hundred years from that time until Martin Luther was raised up at the beginning of the sixteenth century. During those nine hundred years, the Roman Catholic Church did its best to corrupt, degrade, and defile the church in order to transmute it. Under the influence of the Roman Catholic Church, this was the darkest period in human history. I am afraid that speaking about the corruption, abominations, power struggles, hypocrisy, and idolatry of that time would defile our mouths. This dark situation fulfilled the word in Revelation 17:1-6.</p>
<p>The Chinese have a famous proverb that says, &ldquo;As soon as a thing reaches its extremity, it reverses its course.&rdquo; In other words, when the darkest hour comes, daybreak is at hand. The corrupted, dark situation stirred up a number of people who had a pure heart for the Lord. For example, Martin Luther was provoked by the Roman Catholic Church before he began to seek the truth. Martin Luther was a central figure in the Reformation, but he was not alone; the Reformation began long before Martin Luther was raised up. John Huss tried to reform the Roman Catholic Church before Luther came on the scene. Huss received light from the Lord&rsquo;s Word and spoke the basic truths. Because his preaching contradicted the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, he was martyred. However, the seeds that he sowed in central Europe bore fruit a hundred years later.</p>
<p>The recovery of the church that began with John Huss was not strong enough. It was not until Martin Luther was raised up that the recovery of the church was sufficiently strong and full. Martin Luther and those who stood with him recovered the truth concerning justification by faith. The first thing they testified was that Catholicism had lost God&rsquo;s salvation. The Roman Catholic Church was full of sins and had many basic heresies. Heresies are deeper and more serious than sins. Sins are merely weaknesses, but heresies bring in human teachings and other awful things.</p>
<p>Early on, Luther sought to reform the Roman Catholic Church, but he was not able to carry out his plans. The abuses related to the sale of papal indulgences, however, was more than he could tolerate. The Roman Catholic Church sold expensive indulgences for great sins and cheaper indulgences for small sins; it cost more to obtain pardon for big sins, and it cost less for little sins to be forgiven. The poor paid less, and the rich paid more. The pope&rsquo;s representatives sold indulgences in every city, and people were told that as long as they bought indulgences, their sins would be forgiven. This matter provoked Luther more than anything else. At this time Catholicism had forsaken the truth and did whatever it pleased; it even made its sinful practices into doctrines, which were taught to people. In principle, at the time of the Reformation, every truth had been transmuted. The Roman Catholic Church had the Bible, which was not open; it had God&rsquo;s name but still worshipped idols. Catholicism even taught the worship of the bones and relics of its so-called saints; moreover, these bones and relics were frequently fakes sold for profit. Almost every household had some kind of relic; people worshipped the relics and asked the relics for peace and healing. The situation was so low that it is difficult to describe.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s recovery began with the foundational truth of justification by faith; Martin Luther expressed this matter with much light and great clarity. However, those who followed Luther to come out of Catholicism were not sufficiently pure and thus were still somewhat confused. Therefore, Protestantism is still complicated and impure because it was built on a confused and complicated foundation and was not inwardly pure. Although the doctrine of justification by faith was clear, many other aspects of the truth were still in confusion.</p>
<p>At Luther&rsquo;s time the Roman Catholic Church was united with the governments of many European countries. Thus, when Luther challenged the Roman Catholic Church, he was also challenging the governments involved. However, some governments were not in one accord with the Roman Catholic Church. The leaders of some countries were not satisfied with the Roman popes. For example, the states in the region around Germany united themselves with Luther. On the one hand, their support caused Luther to suffer persecution from the Roman Catholic Church and to be harassed by governments that supported Catholicism, but on the other hand, it afforded Luther some support and protection. This put Luther in a very difficult position.</p>
<p>Luther was a man, and despite what he accomplished positively, he was still very weak. At one point, he helped the landowners suppress a peasant revolt; this put him under the powerful hands of the governments that supported him. Wherever the government opposed the popes, the Reformation was active. However, all the churches that came out of Catholicism were, like Catholicism, in union with the world.</p>
<p>Luther&rsquo;s writings clearly indicate that he knew that the church should be separate from the state, but he was unable to accomplish this separation. He hoped that others would be able to do it. Protestantism is weak because it did not make a clean break at the outset. When the Reformation began, the church was not clearly separated from the state, so the church was placed in the hands of &ldquo;Egyptians&rdquo; and returned to &ldquo;Egypt&rdquo; while it was leaving &ldquo;Babylon.&rdquo; It was as if they left the realm of Nebuchadnezzar and went back to Pharaoh. It is not too much to say this. The Reformation causes people to praise God on one hand and to feel heartbroken on the other.</p>
<p>The recovery of justification by faith was a good beginning, but even before Luther&rsquo;s death, the Protestant churches were in confusion because of their union with politics. Many of those who accepted justification by faith accepted only the doctrine and were not regenerated. Many of the leaders of the Reformation used the Reformation for political purposes. They took part in the Reformation for the purpose of obtaining political power. Some political leaders sought to solidify their power base through Protestantism. They participated in the Reformation because they wanted to oppose the political authority of the Roman Catholic Church; as a result, they brought many worldly things into Protestantism. The proper church life was not recovered at the time of Luther; he began the recovery with the truth of justification by faith, but he did not recover anything else worth mentioning. Actually, everything else was in confusion, and the spiritual standard was very low. Thus, in Revelation 3 the Lord says to the church in Sardis, &ldquo;You have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead...establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God...You have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments&rdquo; (vv. 1-2, 4). This word from the Lord to the church in Sardis is a prophecy concerning the condition of Protestantism.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>A careful study of church history and spiritual biographies shows that although Martin Luther formally brought the church out of Catholicism, there were still many spiritual people in the Roman Catholic Church. Thomas &#224; Kempis was such a person; he lived before the time of Luther. After Luther, from the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, there were many spiritual people in the Roman Catholic Church. For example, Madame Guyon lived in the seventeenth century. Madame Guyon&rsquo;s position was similar to that of the mystics, but the line of the mystics did not begin with her. Even before Madame Guyon, many people were living before God; these were not small in number. Although the Roman Catholic Church persecuted them, they remained in Catholicism.</p>
<p>Some things were recovered by those in the realm of the Roman Catholic Church. Protestantism recovered justification by faith, but those in the Roman Catholic Church recovered the knowledge of the inner life. Aside from these two items, in more than a hundred years between Luther in the sixteenth century and Madame Guyon in the seventeenth century, there were no other clear recoveries&mdash;only a general recovery. The first recovery was justification by faith, and the second recovery was the knowledge of the inner life. Madame Guyon is representative of those who recovered the knowledge of the inner life. They paid attention to the inner fellowship with God and to living before Him; historians call them the mystics. Among them, Father Fenelon is very famous. There were many others, but there is little record of them because they were hidden.</p>
<p>For example, George M&#252;ller founded orphanages, but one of his contemporaries also founded orphanages and even took in more orphans than M&#252;ller did. However, this person never released a yearly report, as M&#252;ller did. Although M&#252;ller never asked for donations, he would send out a yearly report to let the believers know the situation with his orphans. Yet others also were practicing to live before God. When we enter the kingdom, we will discover that there were many hidden ones.</p>
<p>Madame Guyon has been overly promoted, and her books are in almost every country. While she did have some knowledge of life, there were many things from her Catholic background that should have been eliminated. Although Luther reformed the church, it seems that God left the recovery of the knowledge of life within the Roman Catholic Church. This was God&rsquo;s reaction to the condition of Protestantism. Throughout the centuries, God&rsquo;s work has been in reaction to man&rsquo;s move; if we do something improper, God will react to what we have done. Thus, the Reformation was a reaction to Catholicism; the recovery of the knowledge of life within Catholicism, however, was a reaction to the legalism and formalism of Protestantism. Even today, many Catholics live before God; they despise Protestantism because it places too much emphasis on outward forms and is ignorant of the inward life.</p>
<p>Although these Catholics who live before God acknowledge that the Roman Catholic Church emphasizes outward forms, they believe that there are many like them in the Roman Catholic Church. I believe that at least a small number in Catholicism are living before God. The epistle to the church in Thyatira in Revelation 2:18-29 shows that there is a group called &ldquo;the rest&rdquo; within the church in Thyatira who are overcomers. We should never think that all the overcomers are in the Protestant churches; there are overcomers in the Roman Catholic Church. God let the recovery of the inner life take place in Catholicism in order to show that the Reformation could not meet His need on the earth and that Protestantism does not meet the standard of His testimony. The recovery of justification by faith was a great thing; the recovery of the knowledge of life was also a great thing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
LEAVING ORGANIZATIONS AND SECTS</h2>
<p>In the sixteenth century the Reformation was fully formed, and in the seventeenth century the knowledge of the inner life was prominent. A hundred years later, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, the Moravian Brethren and Count Zinzendorf were raised up. This was an important development in the recovery, which emphasized leaving politics and earthly organizations.</p>
<p>The recovery in the sixteenth century was justification by faith; it failed to bring the church out of politics and even became involved with politics. Only when Count Zinzendorf and a group of brothers were raised up did the church escape from its ties with worldly governments and earthly organizations. They were able to have such a recovery because of their background and their long-term view. Their background was the seed planted by John Huss three hundred years earlier. At the time of John Huss, many people in northern Europe loved the Lord with a pure heart and could not accept the fallen religion of their day. They opposed the organized church and were driven out of their countries by fierce persecution. These believers moved to Bohemia.</p>
<p>Bohemia is north of Austria in the western half of the Czech Republic, a place which Hitler and the British fought for in the Second World War. When the brothers in Moravia were persecuted for loving the Lord, they moved to Bohemia. Count Zinzendorf, who loved the Lord, lived in Bohemia and took these brothers in; moreover, according to the wisdom given him from the Lord, he led them to drop their backgrounds and to begin to meet in oneness. When they left their lands to move to Bohemia, they spontaneously broke off their relationship with the world&rsquo;s political organizations and with the fallen organization of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
GOING OUT TO PREACH THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Historians do not record that Zinzendorf had any special title in the church. He was not a clergyman; he was merely a brother among the Moravian Brethren. These brothers left both worldly and religious organizations; they were very living and strong. In fifty years they sent out more missionaries to preach the gospel in foreign lands than all the mission boards in the entire world had sent out in the preceding two centuries. They were very strong at that time. Because they had left worldly and religious organizations, the Holy Spirit was able to work freely among them. They recovered going out into the entire earth to bring the testimony of the gospel to all people. Moreover, the Moravian Brethren had many special characteristics, such as loving one another and having a condition of one accord. John Wesley, who was edified by them, said that if it were not for his burden to return to England, he wanted to stay with the Brethren in Bohemia for the rest of his life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>At the time of the Moravian Brethren, all the churches were state churches. The Roman Catholic Church was a state church, and the Protestant churches were state churches. Even today several northern European countries still have the Lutheran Church as their state church. But since the time of the Reformation, some have come out of the state churches and established the so-called private churches, such as the Baptist Church, the Wesleyan Church, and the Presbyterian Church. Just prior to or around the same time as the formation of the private churches, the matter of baptism was recovered. Thus, some believers spontaneously formed the Baptist Church. John Bunyan, who wrote the book <em>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,</em> was a member of the Baptist Church. Those who recovered the matter of baptism also broke off their relationships with earthly governments and established churches apart from the state churches.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE ELDERSHIP</h2>
<p>A short time later, the system of the elders&rsquo; administration of the church was recovered. Some believers saw in the Bible that the older and more mature ones among them should administrate the church; they spontaneously formed the Presbyterian Church. This church was also independent of earthly governments.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF A HOLY LIVING</h2>
<p>The next recovery was of a holy living; this recovery was brought in by the Wesleys and their followers. The Wesley brothers, John and Charles, were excellent students at Oxford University in England. John Wesley was good at preaching sermons, and Charles Wesley was good at writing hymns. They both preached that people should live a holy life. Thus, they made many rules for people to follow regarding how to live a holy life. Some of their rules were according to the truth, but they also made some errors.</p>
<p>At that time the winds of revolution were sweeping through Europe, and they could have swept through England as well. Because of the tremendous influence of the Wesleys and their followers, however, many English people were changed, and reforms were made in English society. Thus, there was no need for such a revolution; a bloodless revolution occurred that saved England from the misfortune of much bloodshed.</p>
<p>John Wesley&rsquo;s influence was very great. His group emphasized holy living; by <em>holy living</em> they meant &ldquo;sinless living.&rdquo; They used Romans 6:22 to say that the result of sanctification is sinlessness. They said that anything unholy is a defilement. Although they did not understand the true meaning of holiness, they still exercised to be holy and to have a holy living. However, because they did not really understand what holiness is, they expounded what the Bible says concerning holiness in a manner that seems correct but is actually incorrect. Nevertheless, many people had a genuine change in their behavior through the recovery of the teaching of a holy living. Prior to this recovery, even the people in Protestantism were corrupted, not to mention those in Catholicism; although the Protestants spoke much about justification by faith, their living was not proper, and they were defeated.</p>
<p>God raised up John Wesley to do the work of recovery in England, but he was very much influenced by the Moravians and received much help from them in the matter of teachings. Thus, the word preached by John Wesley mainly came from the Moravian Brethren.</p>
<p>Later, the teachings of Andrew Murray were primarily based upon the works of William Law. William Law brought great change to the mystics. At William Law&rsquo;s time, the teachings of the mystics were not able to spread, but after his changes, their teachings became more practical. Many of Andrew Murray&rsquo;s teachings were derived from the writings of William Law and therefore from the mystics. John Wesley could not escape from the influence of the mystics; thus, many aspects of his doctrine of holiness contain a mystical viewpoint.</p>
<p>I have read books by the mystics, which teach that sanctification is equivalent to regeneration; thus, if a person is not sanctified, it means that he is not regenerated. Experientially, this is correct, but the truth is not sufficiently accurate. It is not absolutely wrong to state that regeneration is equivalent to sanctification, but there are some problems with such a statement. If sanctification is regeneration, then have those believers who live a defeated life been regenerated or not? This question is problematic.</p>
<p>The Wesleyan recovery was very strong. It was a recovery calling people to live a sin-overcoming life and causing many to pursue a holy living. George Whitefield was the most famous contemporary of the Wesleys, and he was also a very capable person. The Wesleys and Whitefield did not preach the gospel to unbelievers; rather, they preached the gospel to Christians. They said that if a person was not regenerated, he would not be sanctified; this caused people to make a great turn and have a change in their living. People had been living messy lives, but at that time, they had a change in their living. We should not question whether this was from the human element or the divine element; we do not need to analyze it. The main thing is that at the time of the Wesleys, many people had a turn. This recovery caused the boundary line of white linen hangings around the tabernacle to be drawn more clearly.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY AMONG THE BRETHREN</h2>
<p>In the nineteenth century the brothers of the so-called Brethren assemblies were raised up. This was one of God&rsquo;s great recoveries in the history of the church. This recovery was exceedingly strong and very rich. The following items were recovered through the Brethren.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Absolutely Forsaking the World</h2>
<p>It is rare in church history to see a group break its ties with the world as cleanly as the Brethren did. They were much more advanced than the Moravian Brethren. The Moravian Brethren broke their ties with politics and religious organization; the Brethren not only forsook politics and religious organization but also the world. They did this in an absolutely clean way.</p>
<p>Even today there are some among the Brethren who have never had their picture taken so that they will not leave any pictures behind for people to see. Furthermore, it is difficult to find a proper biography of John Nelson Darby because he did not allow people to write his biography or publicize what he did. Some of the Brethren were titled nobility, but they wrote respectful letters to the English monarch renouncing their titles. The pitiful situation today is that some who do not have a doctorate still seek to have a degree. Some of today&rsquo;s preachers have never attended a university, yet they advertise themselves as Dr. So-and-so. The Brethren rejected all such worldly things; they were freed from them. In all of church history they were the most thorough in forsaking the world. This was not merely a form; they were not only separated from the world but actually forsook it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Brotherly Love</h2>
<p>Next, the Brethren recovered the reality of brotherly love. If we were to compare our situation today with their situation one hundred years ago, we would be far behind them. They had the reality of the brotherly love in Philadelphia.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Practical Living</h2>
<p>Moreover, probably no other group of Christians in church history has matched the Brethren in the matter of practical living before the Lord. The practical living of the Brethren included their families. Some have said that the best Christian families in the whole world were those of the Brethren. This recovery of practical Christian living was high, great, and strong.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Truth</h2>
<p>Another particular recovery among the Brethren was the recovery of the truth. Most Christians acknowledge that the recovery of truth and revelation among the Brethren surpassed everything before it; Darby is considered the king of Bible exposition. The proper truths taught in Protestantism today are nearly one hundred percent from the truths recovered by the Brethren. Although their knowledge of a few truths concerning overcoming was incomplete, their knowledge of most truths was very proper. All the orthodox things taught in Protestantism today have been influenced by the teachings of the Brethren. Moody said that if all the books in the entire world were burned, he would be satisfied to have a copy of the Bible and a copy of <em>Notes on the Pentateuch</em> by the Brethren writer C. H. Mackintosh.</p>
<p>The Scofield Reference Bible is popular among Christians today; it is a reference Bible that many preachers cannot do without. Christians are also familiar with Scofield&rsquo;s Bible correspondence course. Nearly ninety percent of what Scofield wrote in these two publications was adopted from Brethren teaching. Thus, Scofield was not an original writer; he passed on material taught by the Brethren, which he collected and edited. Many basic truths&mdash;concerning things such as the church, the Lord&rsquo;s return, prophecies, and the separation between the church and the world&mdash;were recovered at that time. The recovery of these things was bright and clear. Luther recovered the truth of justification by faith, but he did not expound it clearly enough; the Brethren thoroughly expounded the truth of justification by faith.</p>
<p>J. N. Darby, one of the Brethren, wrote #47 in <em>Hymns.</em> It is difficult to find a similar hymn of such quality. The first two stanzas say, &ldquo;Father, Thy name our souls would bless, / As children taught by grace, / Lift up our hearts in righteousness, / And joy before Thy face. / Sweet is the confidence Thou giv&rsquo;st, / Though high above our praise; / Our hearts resort to where Thou liv&rsquo;st / In heaven&rsquo;s unclouded rays.&rdquo; The truth in this hymn is truly high, deep, and penetrating. We must note here that when Brother Watchman Nee translated this hymn into Chinese, he improved upon the original English. Although the hymn was already very good, it was not so clear in its meaning. After passing through Brother Nee&rsquo;s translation, it is clearer.</p>
<p>Darby also wrote #127 in our hymnal. The first stanza says, &ldquo;Hark! ten thousand voices crying, / &lsquo;Lamb of God!&rsquo; with one accord; / Thousand thousand saints replying, / Wake at once the echo&rsquo;ng chord.&rdquo; This hymn is excellent; it is difficult to find another person who could write a hymn in which the truth is so clear and accurate, the meaning so profound and great, and the quality so substantial and outstanding. This was a great recovery.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Brethren also expounded the meaning of justification and sanctification. Before the Brethren were raised up, many people thought they were clear in their knowledge of the truth, but they were actually confused. Only after the Brethren were raised up was the truth clearly defined. More than ninety-five percent of the work to cut straight of the word of the truth (2 Tim. 2:15) was accomplished by the Brethren. We must give them credit. Although people may condemn them today, we still must mention their strong points. The value of the Brethren will not be measured until eternity; only then will we be able to express what practical benefit they were to the church.</p>
<p>Our intention is not to praise the Brethren but to worship God. Luther brought the Bible out of the Roman Catholic Church and made it public, but he did not expound it. The Bible was not expounded until the time of the Brethren. In their hands the truth was recovered in a great and strong way. To this day Darby&rsquo;s five-volume <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> has not been excelled. The thought in the <em>Synopsis</em> is deep; Darby&rsquo;s view is broad, and his knowledge of the Bible is something few have attained. A believer, earnestly pursuing the truth, would still have to study this work for ten years in order to understand it. This set of books has a value and position to which other books cannot compare, so it is no wonder that people honor Darby.</p>
<p>If someone reads and understands the <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible,</em> he will see that in Darby&rsquo;s hands, the Bible is very clear from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22. Darby was not perfect; it is not possible for any man to be perfect. However, the <em>Synopsis</em> is something from the Lord. Darby was fluent in five languages&mdash;English, French, German, Greek, and Hebrew. His Greek and Hebrew were excellent, enabling him to translate the Bible into English, French, and German. I have heard that the French and German versions are his best translations.</p>
<p>In addition to translating the Bible into English, French, and German, Darby also wrote many books. It is difficult to say how he found the time to produce so many precious books. It would be very difficult for an ordinary person, who lived to the age of eighty, to write so many things. Brother Nee said that if Darby had not become a servant of the Lord, he would have been famous in the world because he had a great soul. The truths he recovered are excellent, with a proper view and much light. We thank God for these truths because we have received much help from them. I believe that all those living before God today with a proper knowledge of the Bible have been helped by the Brethren. Even those who oppose the Brethren have received help from them.</p><h2 class="head2">Material Offering</h2>
<p>Another thing recovered by the Brethren is material offering; this is also a great recovery. Even when they were first raised up, the Brethren already knew how to use their earthly possessions for God. They never encouraged or asked the believers to give; they did not even make announcements. They simply lived for God and used their material possessions for Him. In all of church history it is difficult to find a group that can equal the Brethren in the matter of material offering. Once, following a disaster in Central America, the money the Brethren wired to help the brothers exceeded the amount given by the British government, and the Brethren funds arrived sooner. The Brethren used their money for the Lord, and they lived a life of brotherly love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OTHER RECOVERIES</h2>
<p>After the Brethren were raised up, God&rsquo;s recovery work was almost complete. Subsequently, God&rsquo;s recovery work continued gradually. From the time the Brethren were raised up, the recovery work for the next one hundred years was almost entirely in England; this was marvelous. During these one hundred years of recovery, there are a few matters that we must mention.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living by Faith</h2>
<p>The recovery of living by faith before God centered on George M&#252;ller, who testified that man could see God&rsquo;s answer to prayer in the practical matter of finances. Therefore, man should not trust in his money but in God. This practice existed in the days just after Pentecost, but later it disappeared. Luther did not recover this matter, and although it was partially recovered with the Moravian Brethren, it was not recovered in a clear way. The recovery of living by faith did not become crystal clear until George M&#252;ller. He and Darby lived at approximately the same time, although M&#252;ller was five years younger than Darby.</p>
<p>These brothers lived under the principle of living by faith because they all lived by faith before God, freed from religious organization and human methods. The expenses related to the work and the financial support of all the serving ones were a big temptation. But they relied on God, and God looked upon their faith and answered their prayers of faith by specially caring for them. They had many testimonies of this kind of care.</p>
<p>Before M&#252;ller passed away, Hudson Taylor was raised up. Brother Hudson Taylor testified to many things, but his living by faith and looking to God in faith were a strong and important element in his overall testimony. Prior to Hudson Taylor, every mission board used human methods to obtain offerings in support of their foreign mission works. Brother Hudson Taylor was the only one who stood up to say, &ldquo;I do not do anything by asking for donations; I rely only on God&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo; He received much help from M&#252;ller in this matter. All of us today have also received this help; this is an important matter of recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Overcoming</h2>
<p>Next is the recovery of the matter of overcoming. In the historical record and biographies of the past one hundred years of church history, there has been a line of believers who have emphasized the matter of overcoming; moreover, they have lived overcoming lives. One of these believers was Mrs. Hannah Whithall Smith, who wrote a book called <em>The Christian&rsquo;s Secret of a Happy Life.</em> This book was very popular and was appreciated very much. Mrs. Smith and her husband, Robert Pearsall Smith, together with Evan Hopkins in England and Theodore Monod in France, influenced the Keswick Convention. These believers preached only the truth of consecration. Most of the messages at the Keswick Convention dealt with the matter of consecration. God blessed these brothers and sisters very much. They considered that all spiritual experiences are based on consecration. If a person could not pray, overcome sin, or preach the gospel with power, it was because he had not consecrated himself. These messages were very strong at that time, and they helped many people.</p>
<p>In principle, when there is a recovery, the Lord&rsquo;s presence is there initially, but as time goes on, the spiritual level gradually falls. Although the Keswick Convention had the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in the past, if someone today were to preach the consecration of the Keswick Convention, it probably would not touch others as it did before, because the times have changed. Later, Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis rose up to preach the believers&rsquo; co-crucifixion with Christ, which is the truth of the cross. She explained how the cross has dealt with our old man.</p>
<p>With regard to the matter of life, we must also mention Brother Andrew Murray. He was a little earlier than Mrs. Penn-Lewis, and he genuinely knew the indwelling Christ. After Mrs. Penn-Lewis came Brother T. Austin-Sparks, who saw the matter of resurrection. It is right to put the writings of Andrew Murray in sequence before the writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis, because his writings carried on the line of thought of the Keswick Convention. By the same principle, the writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis must be placed before the periodical called <em>A Witness and a Testimony</em> by T. Austin-Sparks, because the central message of Mrs. Penn-Lewis is the cross of Christ, and T. Austin-Sparks, emphasizes the resurrection of Christ. In all of church history, not many people have known and developed the matter of resurrection as much as the periodical put out by Brother T. Austin-Sparks, <em>A Witness and a Testimony.</em> This is the line of overcoming: (1) the secret of the believer&rsquo;s happiness, (2) the indwelling Spirit, (3) dying with Christ, and (4) resurrection. The order of these items is appropriate.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gospel</h2>
<p>Another great recovery, which we should not neglect, is the recovery of the gospel. In England C. H. Spurgeon was called the king of preachers, and in America D. L. Moody was called the king of evangelists. The two were famous preachers of the gospel in the nineteenth century. They brought many people to salvation, and their gospel influenced many people. Just prior to the beginning of the twentieth century, many of the missionaries who went to China were saved through the preaching of Moody and Spurgeon. Very few people have spread the gospel as much as these two men.</p>
<p>The move to take the gospel abroad came next. Foreign missions peaked at the end of the nineteenth century. The gospel went out to the entire globe, following developments in world politics, military affairs, commerce, and culture. Western missionaries preached the gospel all over the world&mdash;in Africa, South America, China, Japan, India, and even in the remote islands of the Pacific Ocean; furthermore, a great deal of money followed these missionaries from Europe and America to the places to which they were sent. This gospel work was prevailing at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. On the one hand, God was working in His church, and on the other hand, the environment was ready. These things were under God&rsquo;s sovereignty.</p>
<p>The gospel in Europe and America was a great recovery, as was the foreign missionary work. However, in the foreign missionary work there were both good things and complicated things. There were all kinds of people with all kinds of backgrounds. For example, the China Inland Mission was good, but not all of its missionaries were very spiritual. When I was serving the Lord in China and had some knowledge of Him, I was able to observe some missionaries from the China Inland Mission. I discovered certain situations that were not acceptable. Some of the missionaries did things in the way of mixture. For example, one of them, who taught theology and wrote a Greek dictionary for the New Testament, eventually became his country&rsquo;s ambassador to China. This was unquestionably good for diplomatic relations, but was spiritually very poor. This is evidence of the confusion and corruption among the missionaries.</p>
<p>There were even non-believers who went out preaching as missionaries. One of my history teachers was an atheist, but he also stood in the pulpit to preach. Therefore, the situation was very confused. The spread of the gospel abroad was a great recovery, but within that recovery there were many corrupt situations that cause one&rsquo;s heart to ache. Many good universities in China were founded by mission boards, such as Yenching University in Peking, Huchiang University in Shanghai, and Tungwu University in Soochow, Kiangsu Province. In addition, the missions founded many hospitals; however, this proves that their work was quite complicated and transmuted.</p>
<p>As a result of these recoveries related to the gospel, there were churches in many places. However, when good things come, bad things follow; when genuine things come, false things follow. In China the people, the work, and the truths were both good and bad, a mixture of a little of everything. However, we still praise the Lord that because of these recoveries, the gospel was preached in our homeland, producing the church throughout China and resulting in our salvation.</p>
<p>If we were to make a list of every recovery from justification by faith up until the present, I believe we would find that almost all the truths in the Bible have been recovered. Although they are not all complete, they are still substantially recovered. Therefore, while we cannot say that everything has been recovered, we can say that almost everything has been recovered.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE HISTORY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN CHINA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">EARLY HISTORY&mdash;BEFORE 1900</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Nestorianism</h2>
<p>Because we were born in China, raised in China, and live in China, we must include the history of Christianity in China in a discussion of our origins. We will begin with the first preaching of Christianity in China.</p>
<p>Based on historical records, the first Christians to come to China were the Nestorians. They came during the Tang Dynasty, between A.D. 600 and A.D. 700. The emperor of the Tang Dynasty ordered his prime minister, Fang Hsuan-ling, to go outside the capital city to welcome these missionaries from Persia. The Nestorian missionaries relied on scholarship to preach the gospel, and their religion spread rapidly among the high government officials, that is, among the intellectuals. With such a strong backing, Nestorianism quickly spread throughout the country. However, because the Nestorians did not lead people to experience Christ as life, Nestorianism died out when the dynasty changed.</p>
<p>During the Ming Dynasty there was a remnant of the Nestorians in Yenching, which is today&rsquo;s Peking. At one time, a Mongolian became the highest Nestorian bishop in Persia. Thus, even during the Ming Dynasty, Nestorianism had not completely disappeared; there was still a small number of Nestorians in northern China.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Catholicism</h2>
<p>The preaching of Catholicism in China began with the arrival of Matteo Ricci during the Ming Dynasty. Matteo Ricci, a very scholarly man, was a member of the Roman Catholic Society of Jesus. Because he knew much about astronomy and the making of calendars, the Chinese imperial court was very courteous to him. Matteo Ricci edited and improved the Chinese lunar calendar, which is also called the imperial calendar. One of the officials in the Ming Dynasty was named Hsu Kuang-chi, and he became a Roman Catholic. He owned a great deal of land in Shanghai&rsquo;s Hsu Chia Hui district, most of which he later donated to the Roman Catholic Church. At that time, many people converted to Catholicism, but most of them were eunuchs or high officials in the capital city; not many were common people.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Protestantism</h2>
<p>Robert Morrison came to China in 1807. He can be considered the first Protestant missionary to come to China. Since China at that time was a closed country and was very strict about not opening to the outside, Morrison sometimes came to do business and sometimes came as a diplomat to the capital city. Later, after China had lost some wars and signed unequal treaties with a number of countries, the door was opened for missionaries to travel inland and freely preach the gospel. The Ching Dynasty was responsible for protecting the missionaries.</p>
<p>Numerous factors, including improvements in transportation, inflation, economic surpluses in Western countries, and the expansion of foreign influence, later made it even more convenient for Western missionaries to come to China. At that time it was easier for a Westerner to enter and leave China than it was for a Chinese; the Westerners did not need entry permits or visas. Westerners came and went freely without the need of any documents. Prior to my salvation, because I did not recognize God&rsquo;s working, I was upset when I saw foreigners on the street. Today I see the spiritual view that this was God&rsquo;s arrangement for the preaching of the gospel in an old, traditional country. If it were not for this way, how could the gospel of Christ have been preached in China?</p>
<p>When the Western missionaries first came to China, they met with difficulty because the Chinese considered all foreigners as enemies. The Treaty of Tientsin between China and England ordained that Penglai, formerly Tengchow Fu, in the Shantung Province would be opened as a port; later, because the water was too shallow to be a good harbor, the port was moved to the commercial harbor at Chefoo. The first Western missionaries to northern China came to Penglai, but it was difficult for them to rent a house. Although the Chinese government allowed foreigners into the country, the populace would not allow them to rent houses, and if foreigners wanted to buy land, no one would sell it to them.</p>
<p>The Chinese people decided that whoever sold land to a foreigner would not be allowed into the ancestral temples or shrines. Thus, no one dared to sell land to foreigners, and this was a big problem to them. Later, the foreigners asked the imperial court of the Ching Dynasty for land, according to the provisions of their treaties. The treaties clearly stated that foreigners could preach the gospel in China and that the imperial court had to protect them. Thus, the imperial court ordered the local officials to gather the landowners together to discuss and solve this problem. As a result, the Presbyterian Church obtained an old Buddhist temple in Penglai, which they remodeled into a chapel for Western missionaries. When I was learning how to serve the Lord, I once preached the gospel in that chapel.</p>
<p>The history of the Lord&rsquo;s move in China includes the Chinese translations of the Bible. During the Nestorian period, Chinese translations of some parts of the Bible already existed. When Matteo Ricci came to China, the Roman Catholics began translating the Bible into Chinese. The present Roman Catholic Chinese translation is a later revision. Robert Morrison was the first Protestant to translate the Bible into Chinese. Much of his translation work was done in Macao, which is close to Canton; Morrison spent some of his time in Canton and some in Macao. Three hundred years ago Macao was a Portuguese colony. Robert Morrison employed various reasons to remain in Macao, but his real task there was the translation of the Bible into Chinese.</p>
<p>The Chinese Union Version that we use today has been revised many times. In 1890 a committee of seven men was formed for the translation of the Bible. The chairman of the committee was Calvin Wilson Mateer, who founded Chilu University in Shantung Province. The seven men on the committee were usually in different places, each translating at his own pace. Every summer they would meet in Chefoo to work together. Because each verse had been translated in many different ways, they would put the different renderings side by side and consider which would be best for the final version. An elderly brother among us, Brother Chu, assisted Mr. Mateer by copying the translation of the Bible. The committee spent a total of twenty-nine years on this translation of the Bible, finishing in 1919. The Chinese Union Version is the best Chinese translation of the Bible.</p>
<p>When Calvin Mateer first came to China, he came to the town in which I was born. One story says that he learned Chinese in an idol temple. This illustrates the fact that when the missionaries first came to China, it was difficult for them to contact the Chinese people. It was not only difficult for them to find places to stay but also to find food to eat. When they went out to buy food, people were not necessarily willing to sell to them. Thus, in the beginning their situation was very difficult. The conservative, closed attitude among the Chinese was especially strong in the northern part of China; it is truly beyond description. But God is really God; He is over all things and controls all situations, causing all things to work together for His gospel. Regardless of how closed and conservative the Chinese were, God still opened the door for the gospel.</p><h2 class="head1">RECENT HISTORY&mdash;1900 TO 1925</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Turn in 1900</h2>
<p>In 1900 there was an important turn in the history of the church in China. The Chinese were opposed to foreigners, but according to the treaties, the government was supposed to protect Westerners. This agitated the people; some among the Chinese rose up to form a group called <em>I Ho Tuan,</em> which means &ldquo;Boxers United in Righteousness.&rdquo; They were very superstitious and practiced Chinese martial arts. The Boxers&rsquo; slogan was &ldquo;Support the Ching Dynasty; destroy the foreigners,&rdquo; and they had the approval of the Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi. The movement eventually led to the Boxer Rebellion in northern China, in which Western missionaries and Chinese believers were killed.</p>
<p>The Boxers called foreigners &ldquo;primary devils&rdquo; and Chinese believers &ldquo;secondary devils&rdquo;; they targeted these two groups for slaughter. The greatest number of martyrs was among the missionaries of the China Inland Mission in Pingyang Fu of Shansi Province. There the church in China encountered its greatest persecution; it was also the greatest purification for the church in China. Many Chinese had joined the Christian religion out of an impure motive; however, many loved the Lord with a pure heart. During this time of persecution, many Chinese believers shed their blood and tears to maintain a good testimony for the Lord.</p>
<p>The worst method of persecution was the roadside worship test. The Boxers would set up an idol image at an intersection and require everyone that passed by to kneel and worship the idol; whoever refused to worship the idol would be dragged to the side of the road and beheaded. Such murders were not considered illegal; on the contrary, they were supported by an imperial edict. Believers in all the major cities in northern China experienced persecution at that time, and those in the cities in the province of Shansi suffered the most. Because the governor of Shantung Province, Yuan Shih-kai, was more experienced with the outside world and was able to deal wisely with the imperial court, the believers in Shantung Province were not harmed as much as in the other provinces. During that time many false believers and weak believers were stumbled; however, many true believers stood strongly for the Lord and were a good testimony for Him. We must recognize that the year 1900 was a great turn for the church in China. Before that time, no one in China had ever clearly risen up to testify for the Lord, and there had not been any manifest servants of the Lord.</p>
<p>In 1911 the Nationalist revolution was successful in overthrowing the Manchu government, and the government of the newly formed Republic of China actively promoted a scientific culture; this benefited Christianity in many ways. The Chinese people became more open-minded, and public opinion changed. Because the environment had changed, the condition of the churches also changed. Thus, many strong witnesses for the Lord were raised up among the believers in China.</p>
<p>The Boxer Rebellion in 1900 was a great turn in the church in China. The first stage, or the beginning stage, of the church in China was the time before 1900. When the Boxers began killing Christians in China in 1900, the church in China entered its second stage. The second stage lasted from 1900 to 1925. During this time, God raised up many people because of two main reasons. First, the atmosphere in China became more open, and the Chinese were more receptive to Western culture. Second, when the Manchu government fell in 1911 and a republic was raised up, great changes occurred in things like culture, thinking, education, and theories. These changes were environmental, and although we do not emphasize them, they were undoubtedly a factor in the spread of God&rsquo;s church in China.</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of seed we sow, its growth does not merely depend on the attributes of the seed itself but also on factors such as soil, climate, sunshine, and rain. God&rsquo;s seed of life is the best seed, and it was sown into the soil of China through the preaching of the gospel, but the development of the seed needed a change in the environment and the cooperation of the soil. China&rsquo;s backward, traditional, and stubbornly closed condition initially prevented the full development of the seed, but eventually there was a great change in Chinese society, popular opinion, and cultural atmosphere. This prompted the raising up of many witnesses.</p>
<p>The proper beginning of the gospel in China dates back to 1850. In the half century from 1850 to 1900, the Lord graced China with many good evangelists. When Robert Morrison came to China in 1807, he was hardly able to preach the gospel at all, so we cannot say that the gospel work in China began with him. It was not until Hudson Taylor came to China in the 1860s that the gospel work in China had a good start. Brother Hudson Taylor&rsquo;s biography shows that God sent him to preach the gospel to the Chinese. Others, like Hunter Corbett and Calvin Wilson Mateer, loved the Lord and suffered for the gospel, even to the extent of giving up their lives. They testified before both God and man. They were purely for the gospel and not for anything else.</p>
<p>By the twentieth century missionaries were sent to China by Western mission boards, and the situation was very confused; all kinds of people were mixed together. However, in the confusion, God preserved some who genuinely sought to bring the gospel to the Chinese people. Mr. Woodbury, of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, and Griffith John, who preached in the middle parts of China, were such ones; they were faithful in bringing the gospel to China. The situation was similar to that of the church after the day of Pentecost; although there was mixture, there was also the element of pure gold.</p>
<p>During this time period, the Chinese were dissatisfied with the Western missionaries who came to China for a number of reasons and generally had a negative impression of them. In my school, I used a history textbook published in America that stated clearly, &ldquo;The missionary boards are an instrument of imperialism.&rdquo; We asked our professor about this statement; he was an American missionary sent by a mission board. This humble brother confessed that this statement, along with many other things written in the textbook, were regrettably true. Although this was the case, many missionaries were purely for the gospel.</p>
<p>Related to the mission boards sending people to China, I hope that we can see more than that they were numerous and confused; we should see that there were also many precious, pure missionaries. These precious missionaries sacrificed their all for the gospel and were purely for the Lord, without a heart for anything else. Therefore, by the end of the nineteenth century, the seed of the gospel was properly planted among the people of China.</p>
<p>Because Brother Hudson Taylor sent missionaries into the inland regions of China, the gospel spread to many places, even Szechwan Province. The work of the China Inland Mission in Shansi Province was very effective, spreading even to northwest China. They brought the good seed of the gospel and planted it in the soil of China. That pure seed was not mixed with things like the establishing of schools or hospitals. Therefore, by 1900 Satan became angry and raised up the Boxer Rebellion to damage the gospel. We can speak of two aspects of the Boxer Rebellion. First, from a nationalistic or Chinese viewpoint, the Boxers had some justification for what they did; however, Satan used their uprising to kill many Christians. Second, through the Boxer Rebellion, the Lord did a work of purification and continued to raise up more believers.</p><h2 class="head2">Witnesses Raised Up by God</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, the Lord raised up many witnesses among the Chinese. Of the many who were well known at the time, one was Lee Shu-ching, a medical doctor from Chekiang Province. As soon as the Lord raised him up, he had much knowledge of life and of the way of the cross. He read all the books written by Mrs. Penn-Lewis and Andrew Murray. Having read some of his books, I can say that Lee Shu-ching knew a good deal concerning the cross. Anyone who heard him preach can testify that he had the Lord&rsquo;s presence and that there was light and power in his speaking. Not long after the Lord raised him up as a young man, he was leading a Bible study for Western missionaries in Shanghai. For this to have happened forty years ago shows how deeply and richly the Lord&rsquo;s grace worked in him. Regrettably, he passed away when he was in his thirties. It is said that he died because he was exhausted from his labor and contracted tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Following Lee Shu-ching there was Pastor Ting Li-mei. Thirty-two years ago I heard him preach a message titled &ldquo;I Come That My Sheep May Have Life and May Have It More Abundantly.&rdquo; From the topic it is clear that he had some knowledge of spiritual things. Later, when I was already saved and had begun to serve the Lord, I met him in Tientsin. Although he was very old, I could sense when I fellowshipped with him that he was in the Lord&rsquo;s hands and had been used by the Lord. He was from northern China, but in that closed and conservative era, he also went to southern provinces&mdash;Fukien and Kwangtung&mdash;to preach the gospel. When he was first raised up, he was very powerful.</p>
<p>Then there was Sister Dora Yu, who is especially related to our history. She was involved in the preaching of the gospel throughout China. She was from Ningpo in Chekiang Province, and although she was a traditional woman with bound feet, she received a modern education. Her family sent her to England to study medicine, but before she left China, she was saved. On the way to England, when the ship docked at Marseilles in France, she decided to leave the ship and return to China. The ship&rsquo;s captain and crew were perplexed, and when they asked her why she would do this, she answered, &ldquo;I have a heavy burden to preach the gospel to my fellow Chinese.&rdquo; They assumed that she was mentally ill and paid no attention to her at first, but ultimately she bothered them so much that they were forced to allow her to return to China.</p>
<p>When she arrived in Shanghai, her family thought that she had gone crazy and could not understand what had happened. However, she ignored these things and began to travel all over the country preaching the gospel. This was the Lord&rsquo;s doing. Her family did not care for her needs, but with the help of a Western missionary, she rented a dilapidated house on Broadway Road in Shanghai, just beyond the Bund in the district across Pai Tu Bridge. That area was desolate. She lived in that house, which she called &ldquo;Gospel Hall,&rdquo; and began to preach the gospel there. Her powerful preaching of the gospel was filled with the Lord&rsquo;s presence; the denominations noticed this and began inviting her to preach the gospel. Her central message was that after being saved, a person needs to be regenerated; in other words, if a person became a church member and was baptized without being regenerated, he would not be able to be raptured. Although this message was not entirely correct, at that time it was powerful.</p>
<p>The Lord raised up many others with Sister Dora Yu, from both northern and southern China; they loved and pursued the Lord constantly. However, they had no one to lead them, their light was insufficient, their way was not clear, and they had no messages to read on pursuing the Lord as life, much less on serving the Lord. Nevertheless, it is evident that the Holy Spirit was working because He raised up groups who loved and pursued the Lord in all places. For example, there is a small community called Lin Village in the eastern part of the Shantung Province, close to Weihaiwei. An elderly, learned man named Mr. Sai lived in Lin Village. He had light when he read the Bible, and he began to meet with a group of believers who were also well-educated. On the one hand, they saw that the Western missionaries had brought the gospel and the Lord&rsquo;s name to China; however, on the other hand, they saw that the Western missionaries were incorrect in their organization. Thus, the believers in Lin Village refused to join their organizations. They accepted the gospel, the Bible, and the Lord, but they rejected anything else from the mission boards.</p>
<p>The believers in Lin Village were zealous for the Lord, and they went so far as to have Mr. Sai write a letter to the imperial court rebuking the Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi for being an adulteress and urging her to repent and believe the gospel. This was considered a very rebellious act. The Ching imperial court immediately issued an edict from the Empress Dowager, ordering the governor of Shantung Province to investigate and incarcerate the &ldquo;rebels.&rdquo; The basic governmental districts at that time were <em>tao, fu,</em> and <em>hsien.</em> Since the &ldquo;rebellion&rdquo; took place in the administrative district ruled by the magistrate of the <em>tao,</em> the magistrate was not only responsible for ascertaining the facts of the case but was also implicated in the crime. Thus, in order to escape responsibility himself, he wrote a letter to the imperial court saying that the believers in Lin Village were a group of lunatics. In this way, he was eventually able to obtain a pardon for them.</p>
<p>In the meantime, on the appointed day the executioner was ready to carry out their death sentence; however, the believers from Lin Village were calm in the prison. Some of the brothers among them took off their collars and made particular preparations to be martyred for the Lord. Everyone was waiting for the sound of the cannon to announce the time of execution. With only a few minutes left before the appointed time, a telegram came from the Ching imperial court saying that they were pardoned. This was the work of the Holy Spirit. Nonetheless, they were not released from prison until after the overthrow of the Ching Dynasty and the establishment of the republic.</p>
<p>This example illustrates that the Holy Spirit works strongly in hidden places without our knowledge. Of course, the group in Lin Village was off in some ways because they lacked the fellowship of the Body and had not read church history. Thus, they lacked the light seen in previous eras and took an extreme way. Nevertheless, they had a good testimony; such a testimony was the work of the Holy Spirit in them. The work of the Holy Spirit was carried out even in the remote country villages of northern China, and many lovers of the Lord were raised up all over China.</p>
<p>Sister Dora Yu was greatly used by the Lord in her youth. When she was in her fifties, in about 1920, she went to Foochow and held a gospel meeting in the Hall of Heavenly Peace. Brother Nee attended that meeting and was saved after hearing the message; he was seventeen at the time. In 1921 Sister Yu went to Hangchow to hold a gospel meeting, and Sister Peace Wang was saved in that meeting. Between 1920 and 1925 the Lord worked in marvelous ways in northern and southern China to raise up at least twenty or thirty young people. One of these young people was Brother Wang Ming-tao in the north. These young people had recently graduated from high school and were entering college.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE HISTORY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN CHINA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUR GENEALOGY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A Seed Prepared by God</h2>
<p>Sister M. E. Barber, an English woman, is related to the genealogy of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. When Brother Watchman Nee received the Lord, Sister M. E. Barber had been living in China for more than ten years. Initially, she was a missionary sent by a mission board to China in order to preach the gospel. However, because her co-workers were jealous of her, they fabricated charges against her and presented them to the English mission board. She had learned of the Lord not to vindicate herself. She did not disclose that she had been falsely accused until the chairman of the mission board said to her, &ldquo;As your authority, I order you to tell me everything and not to hide anything.&rdquo; After this matter passed, she felt that she could no longer remain with the mission. After another period of time, she felt that she should return to China, and the Lord opened a way for her to go. She came to Foochow at the mouth of the Min River and lived at Bai-Ya-Tan across from Mawei.</p>
<p>The history of the church in China shows that M. E. Barber was the first strong witness in China. She lived purely before the Lord and knew much of the cross and the Lord&rsquo;s life. Her deep experiences are evident in the hymns she wrote. One reads, &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s less of earth joy, / Give, Lord, more of heaven. / Let the spirit praise Thee, / Though the heart be riven... / Lonely though the pathway, / Cheer it with Thy smile; / Be Thou my companion / Through earth&rsquo;s little while&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #377). Another hymn she wrote is &ldquo;He faileth not, for He is God&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #693); this hymn is familiar to many people in Christianity. In addition, she also wrote other hymns, such as &ldquo;Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #671), &ldquo;Via Bethlehem we journey&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #628), and &ldquo;To the foe my word is always, &lsquo;No&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>Hymns,</em> #880).</p>
<p>Brother Nee not only mentioned Miss Barber in his messages; he also mentioned her a few times when I spoke to him privately. Every time he mentioned her, I received a deep impression. He said that every time he went to see Miss Barber, as he sat in the living room waiting for her, he would sense the presence of the Lord. On one occasion in 1936, as we were discussing the work and the service, Brother Nee sighed and said, &ldquo;If only Miss Barber were still alive, our condition today would be completely different.&rdquo; He also once said, &ldquo;When I visited Europe and America in 1933, I visited spiritual people in both places, but it was not easy to find even one who could compare with Miss Barber. There was only one brother who seemed to be comparable to her.&rdquo; Brother Nee said this in 1935, only two years after he returned from England. This shows that Miss M. E. Barber was very deep in her relationship with God; she genuinely knew God. She is a very weighty person in our history.</p>
<p>Brother Nee and his mother were both saved through Sister Dora Yu&rsquo;s gospel preaching. Brother Nee&rsquo;s mother was saved first and turned to the Lord, which influenced Brother Nee. Brother Nee was saved in 1920. Not long after his salvation, he and his mother met Miss Barber, and they went together to her home and were baptized by immersion. Brother Nee&rsquo;s mother frequently played mah-jongg prior to her salvation, even though she was a member of the Methodist denomination. However, after she was saved, she changed a great deal. When the two of them, mother and son, were baptized, our history began. From the time of his baptism Brother Nee was clear that Miss M. E. Barber had been prepared by God to lead him. In other words, Brother Nee gave himself completely to Miss Barber for her leading.</p>
<p>A number of other young people around the same age as Brother Nee also went to Miss Barber for her teaching. Regrettably, after a short time they left, one after another, because Miss Barber rebuked people severely. Brother Nee testified that Miss Barber rebuked him severely and even dealt with him unreasonably. However, after he was rebuked he did not feel uncomfortable; on the contrary, the more he was rebuked, the more he felt the benefit. Thus, he continued to go to her despite the rebukes.</p>
<p>Miss Barber dealt severely with Brother Nee. Brother Nee and one of the other brothers were the most gifted among the young people of their generation; they were the best preachers. However, they usually did not get along, even in simple matters, such as opening and closing a door. Once, they asked Miss Barber who should carry out a baptism. Brother Nee thought that Miss Barber would have him do the baptizing because he had preached the gospel and led the person to the Lord. However, Miss Barber appointed the other brother to do the baptism. Later, Brother Nee asked Miss Barber why she had not allowed him to baptize. Miss Barber answered, &ldquo;That brother is older than you, so he should do the baptizing.&rdquo; Since the brother was older, Brother Nee could not say anything in response.</p>
<p>Not long after, there was another baptism meeting, and there were three brothers present who could baptize&mdash;Brother Nee, the older brother, and the third brother who was the eldest of the three. Brother Nee thought that according to age, the eldest brother would do the baptizing. Brother Nee wanted to see how Miss Barber would handle this matter. Miss Barber, however, appointed the same brother who had baptized the previous time. Brother Nee did not agree and went again to question Miss Barber. She answered, &ldquo;I want to do it this way.&rdquo; This seemed unreasonable, and Brother Nee could not take it. However, he later testified that Miss Barber&rsquo;s unreasonable dealings with him enabled him to receive the Lord&rsquo;s grace and mercy to place himself before her, because he knew that he could get much help from her.</p>
<p>After a few years, Brother Nee and Miss Barber knew each other well and had deep fellowship; their affection for each other in the Lord was very deep and broad. When Miss Barber passed away in 1930, she left almost all her spiritual books, writings, letters, and Bibles to Brother Nee. Brother Nee said that if anyone were to write a biography of Miss Barber, he would be the best person to do it. He wanted to write Miss Barber&rsquo;s biography because he thought it would help the brothers and sisters in China. Regrettably, the Lord never gave him the opportunity to do this. Miss M. E. Barber is a seed in our history that grew in Brother Nee. Thus, when we speak of the history among us, we cannot avoid speaking of her.</p><h2 class="head2">The Process of the Church&rsquo;s Spreading</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Early Spreading</h2>
<p>After Sister Dora Yu went to Foochow to preach the gospel, a group of young believers was raised up in Foochow. In 1923 they held a gospel meeting in the home of one of the brothers and invited Sister Ruth Lee from Nanking to be the speaker. Sister Ruth Lee was still a young person; she wrote very well and was the editor of <em>The Spiritual Light</em> paper in Nanking. At the time, <em>The Spiritual Light</em> was the best spiritual periodical in China; it had much spiritual essence. Many spiritual believers from all over China, such as Kao Shih-chu, Sun Hsi-sheng, Chia Yu-ming, and Cheng Chi-kwei, would submit articles to the paper. Sister Ruth Lee was responsible for collecting their articles and editing them into a bi-monthly publication; this paper gave the believers of that time much help. After 1930, however, <em>The Spiritual Light</em> did not carry as much spiritual weight as it once did.</p>
<p>Sister Ruth Lee&rsquo;s gospel preaching in Foochow caused a revival in the city, and many people were saved. Because so many people came to the meetings, each attendee had to bring his own chair. The brothers and sisters began the practice of wearing gospel vests at that time. The gospel vests were gospel banners; some people hung them on their front while others hung them on their back. They shouted gospel slogans on the streets and invited people to come and hear the gospel. In this way, meetings began in Foochow. It was a new beginning in China as far as meetings were concerned. Most of those in the meetings were students. Brother Nee had the main responsibility for ministering the word and preaching the gospel in the meetings. In addition to Brother Nee, there were two other gifted brothers; one carried on a gospel work outside the meetings, and the other expounded the Bible. Initially, no one paid much attention to these two brothers.</p>
<p>In 1924 some trouble began because of Mr. Woodbury, a missionary from the Christian and Missionary Alliance and the person in charge of the Truth-Keeping Chapel in Shanghai. When he heard that there was a revival in Foochow, he suggested that since the brothers had risen up to serve the Lord, they should be ordained as preachers and ministers. Among the three responsible brothers in Foochow, one decided to accept the ordination; this caused a problem. Brother Nee felt that ordination was wrong and released a message concerning the history of the Ark. Later, as editor of <em>The Christian,</em> I received a written copy of that message. The main point was that prior to the desolation of Israel, the Ark was in the tabernacle, and the Ark and the tabernacle were one. God&rsquo;s testimony depends on the Ark; the tabernacle is the outward expression with the Ark as its content. When Israel was in desolation, the Ark was separated from the tabernacle; the tabernacle was in Gibeon, but the Ark was in another place. Therefore, when Solomon began to serve the Lord, he went first to make offerings at the tabernacle in Gibeon, but after seeing a vision from the Lord, he returned to Jerusalem in order to make his offerings before the Ark (1 Kings 3:4-15).</p>
<p>Based on this history of the Ark, Brother Nee pointed out that before the church became desolate, it had the proper outward appearance, and its content was Christ. In other words, Christ is the Ark of God. Because of the desolation of the church, the testimony of Christ and the outward appearance of the church were separated. The church became desolate; the outward appearance of the church was separated from its inward content. During such a time, the believers should pay attention to the Ark, not to the tabernacle; the believers should follow Solomon to pay attention to Christ as the content of the church and not care for its outward appearance.</p>
<p>After Brother Nee released this message, the brother who wanted to be ordained gathered the rest of the co-workers together and said, &ldquo;Brother Nee does not want the church.&rdquo; Thus, when Brother Nee was away on a trip, they took the opportunity to excommunicate him. From then on, the church in Foochow had problems and divisions. Brother Nee was in Nanking when he was excommunicated; therefore, many of the brothers in Foochow felt that this action was not fair to him. They wrote letters and telegrams to Brother Nee, which touched him inwardly. Later, as he went to give conferences and release messages in Nanking, Hangchow, and Shanghai, he felt that he would be affected if he read the letters; therefore, he decided not to read any of the letters and telegrams from Foochow.</p>
<p>He waited until he was on the boat returning to Foochow from Shanghai to read the letters one by one. As he opened letter after letter, he became more and more angry, but the Lord still spoke to him inwardly, saying, &ldquo;Do not argue; arguing is of the flesh.&rdquo; The Lord calmed him. When the boat arrived at Mawei, the brothers from Foochow came in a group to meet him; they spoke only of his excommunication. As soon as they brought it up, Brother Nee again became angry, but the Lord still required him to be calm. He felt before the Lord that he could not argue about the excommunication, and he saw that it was a big problem. Many brothers were on his side and thought that he had been treated unfairly; he invited everyone to meet that very evening. Brother Nee knew that any discussion of the excommunication would be very explosive; he was clear that they could not discuss it. Therefore, when the brothers came, he immediately told them that he would move his luggage to Mawei, leave Foochow to live in Bai-Ya-Tan, and let the brothers in Foochow meet as they pleased. This resolved the problem related to ordination. As someone who had been excommunicated, Brother Nee felt that he should not argue; he had a deep burden to labor solely on the publication work.</p>
<p>In 1923 Brother Nee began to publish a magazine entitled <em>The Present Testimony;</em> in Chinese it is called <em>Fu-shing,</em> which means &ldquo;revival.&rdquo; Then in 1925 he began to publish <em>The Christian</em> from Mawei. Many of the messages in <em>The Christian</em> concerned the matter of the church; some were on the way of the church, and others were on the ground of the church. These messages were a strong encouragement to the churches at that time. The greatest encouragement came from Brother Nee&rsquo;s meditations on the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3&mdash;<em>Meditations on Revelation.</em> Almost all the lovers of the Lord among the Chinese young people had a copy of this publication in their hands. The spiritual exposition in <em>Meditations on Revelation</em> was a great awakening concerning the condition of the church; it did a foundational work in the young lovers of the Lord. Before I read that publication, the Holy Spirit had already done much work in me. I was not only saved but also had determined to give up the world. Although as a student I was poor, I was willing to pay the price to buy this kind of spiritual publication. Therefore, through the impact of <em>The Christian,</em> something strong was stirring within me. Thus, many meetings were raised up throughout China during that period of time due, on one hand, to the multifaceted work of the Holy Spirit and, on the other hand, to this publication. The teachings in <em>The Christian</em> were a strong factor in the raising up of meetings throughout China.</p>
<p>Apart from dealing with the matter of the church, <em>The Christian</em> also contained many messages on salvation, such as &ldquo;The Fastest Way to Hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Paths to Hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why Good Men Go to Hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Robber Saved,&rdquo; and others. These messages helped many people to be saved and to be clear regarding salvation. Brother Tu Chung-chen, who met with us, was not clearly saved until he read &ldquo;The Assurance of Salvation.&rdquo; Because <em>The Christian</em> emphasized spirituality, pursuit of a spiritual life, and spiritual warfare, it was a great help to those pursuing spirituality. Thus, the effects of <em>The Christian</em> fall into three categories: First, it gave the believers who loved the Lord a proper concept concerning the church and the raising up of meetings. Second, it made people clear regarding salvation. Third, it gave people a way to go on in their spiritual pursuit and to obtain a spiritual supply. <em>The Christian</em> had a great influence on the believers in China.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE HISTORY OF THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN CHINA</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<p>About two years after Brother Nee began putting out <em>The Christian,</em> many believers were raised up to pursue the Lord both in northern and southern China, because the messages in <em>The Christian</em> provoked the lovers of the Lord regarding the real condition of the church. They were shaken inwardly and were willing to take a pure, new way in order to be pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Situation from 1927 to 1942</h2>
<p>In 1927 Brother Nee began meeting with a small number of brothers and sisters in Shanghai. In the beginning there was one brother and a few sisters, and they broke bread in the home of Sister Peace Wang&rsquo;s father. They met there until 1928, when they rented a building in Shanghai and formally began to meet. From 1927 or 1928 Brother Nee felt that the center of his work should be in Shanghai. Thus, in 1927 Brother Nee moved his personal belongings and the Gospel Book Room to Shanghai. The work in Shanghai began at that time, and the church in Shanghai was established.</p>
<p>In February 1928 Brother Nee held the first overcomer conference in Shanghai. As a result of this conference, churches were raised up in numerous places in the northern part of Kiangsu Province. Several preachers from that area came to Shanghai for the conference and were blessed by it; thus, they brought the Lord&rsquo;s testimony back to Kiangsu Province. Within three or four years they raised up more than ten local churches with many members. In Pingyang County (in which Wenchow is located) in the southern part of Chekiang Province, many brothers began to serve and meet between 1928 and 1930. Within a few years they raised up more than twenty local churches in various towns and villages. When we visited that area in 1934, we did not have to go very far to get from one locality to the next. Thus, between 1927 and 1930 churches were established in Shanghai, in the northern part of Kiangsu, and in the southern part of Chekiang.</p>
<p>In October 1931 Brother Nee held the second overcomer conference. I planned to attend those meetings, but on September 18, the day of my scheduled departure, Japan invaded the three northeastern provinces of China, creating a dangerous situation in Chefoo, where I was living. Everyone was worried that I was traveling by steamship, and many people exhorted me not to go to Shanghai for fear that I would not be able to return home. Because of these exhortations, I cancelled my trip just before boarding the ship. Therefore, I did not attend those meetings. In November 1932 Brother Nee led a conference in the church in Shanghai. Eight Western believers visited the church in Shanghai and fellowshipped with the brothers; some of them were Englishmen, one was an American, and some were Australians. These believers came from Brethren assemblies. Because we had bought their books and fellowshipped with them through correspondence, they found out that believers in many places in China had left organized Christianity and were serving God in a hidden way. They wanted to visit the saints in China, and the brothers in Shanghai agreed to receive them. From the outset we made it clear that we were fellowshipping with them only as individual believers and that we did not agree to any connection or relationship with the organizations they represented. I was not present at that conference, but I learned that that visit did not have a good result and that it was not easy to fellowship with the Western saints. Moreover, some difficulties also arose in other areas.</p>
<p>In 1932 meetings also began in the northern part of China. The churches in the north were raised up later than those in Shanghai, Kiangsu, and Chekiang; thus, northern China was the fourth area where churches were raised up. Chefoo and Tsinan began their meetings around the same time in the summer of 1932. After approximately half a year, meetings began in Tientsin and Peking. Thus, by the second half of 1933 there were proper local churches in Chefoo, Tsinan, Tientsin, and Peking.</p>
<p>The fact that these four large cities in northern China had meetings greatly influenced other places. Although the churches in the north were established after those in the south, the churches in the north were raised up in big cities. This was different from the churches in Kiangsu and Chekiang, which began in remote rural areas. Peking and Tientsin were the first and second largest cities in northern China, and Tsinan was the third or fourth largest city. Although Chefoo had a population of only two hundred thousand or so, it was the center of Christianity in northern China; thus, Chefoo had a great influence on Christians in northern, eastern, and western China.</p>
<p>Toward the end of 1933 meetings began in Changchun in northeastern China. These meetings included people who were not only influential in the church but also very powerful socially and economically.</p>
<p>In January 1934 Brother Nee held the third overcomer conference. This third conference was on a larger scale than the first two, having a larger number of brothers from many different places. Many brothers came from localities without a church meeting or from other Christian groups. Many of them were still serving the Lord in various organizations. More than ten brothers came from Chefoo. The Lord&rsquo;s blessing was on that conference; the messages were high, focusing on Christ as the centrality and universality of God and on God&rsquo;s overcomers, and were given over a period of ten days. During that time the brothers all fellowshipped with each other. The meetings were full of the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and the messages were full of power and blessing. Every person went home filled with Christ.</p>
<p>After the conference the work that the Holy Spirit had begun in many places was stirred up. Thus, in 1934 in all of China except the western and central regions&mdash;that is, except for the provinces of Szechwan, Hunan, and Hupei&mdash;churches were raised up in locality after locality like bamboo shoots sprouting up after a rainfall. The raising up of the churches was a rushing, torrential flow. The slogan of that time was, &ldquo;Leaving the denominations; walking in the way.&rdquo; This aroused strong opposition from Christianity. Because I was serving in Shanghai as the acting editor of <em>Collection of Newsletters</em> and had to collect the news from all the localities, I was more clear than others concerning the situation of each locality. The flow for the raising up of churches and leaving the denominations was astonishing; moreover, each person who left the denominations sent a formal letter to his denomination with two main points: &ldquo;Because I want to walk in the Lord&rsquo;s way, the proper way, please remove my name from your book of life.&rdquo; The Christian organizations in China, especially the Western missionaries, were shaken and rose up to oppose us.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1934 meetings began in Fengtien, that is, Shenyang. Not long afterward, meetings began in Harbin and Dairen. By the end of 1934 there were churches in each of the four largest cities in the northeast, in Manchuria&mdash;Changchun, Fengtien, Harbin, and Dairen.</p>
<p>In October 1934 Brother Nee held the fourth overcomer conference in Hangchow. Prior to the conference, there was already a meeting in Hangchow. The Lord blessed this fourth overcomer conference, but I felt that it was not as strong as the third one. This conference was attended by believers from northern China and Manchuria. Because this conference was attended by so many believers from northern China and Manchuria, its greatest influence was on the churches in Manchuria.</p>
<p>The first half of 1935 was a very difficult time among us. On the one hand, there were severe attacks from the outside; some people printed tracts opposing us and even started rumors about us. They distributed the tracts at the exits of denominational churches when services let out. They took every opportunity to attack Brother Nee. On the other hand, there was trouble among the co-workers. The problems began when I was in northern China; the brothers sent me a telegram telling me to hurry back to Shanghai. I do not want to describe how serious this matter was, but when I returned to Shanghai two or three weeks later, all the co-workers were gone; I was the only one remaining. They left because the outside opposition exposed our inner problems.</p>
<p>Brother Nee was in a very difficult situation because the co-workers left, one by one, without telling him the reason. This left us with a bad feeling. They did not leave because there had been a difference of opinions; it almost seemed as though they left against their will. Only one elderly sister, who had not been subject to outside attacks and did not have any opinions, stayed with us to deal with the situation. Regrettably, however, her father was imprisoned and became ill in prison, so she needed to leave to care for him. When she left, I was the only one remaining. This difficult situation lasted for about four months.</p>
<p>Eventually, the co-workers came back, one by one, because they had the grace of God and learned some lessons of spiritual life. Because of these problems, Brother Nee was in a difficult situation and was not willing to do anything openly. About ten brothers and sisters, myself included, invited him to Hangchow to study Song of Songs; this was still in 1935. The book <em>The Song of Songs</em> is compiled from the notes of that time.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1935 I returned to northern China; Brother Nee planned at that time to travel through Manchuria, then through Siberia, and on to England. When he passed through Chefoo, we met together. That meeting was blessed by the Lord and caused some people to be revived. Brother Nee recovered the inward freshness and dropped his plan to go to England; instead, he returned to Shanghai. When he arrived in Shanghai, he held some meetings, and these meetings brought in a revival. The central messages released that summer in both Chefoo and Shanghai emphasized Christ as the overcoming life.</p>
<p>Because of the revival of 1935, the co-workers felt at the end of 1936 and the beginning of 1937 that we had never truly gone out for the spreading of the gospel; moreover, the churches in big cities like Nanking and Tientsin were very weak. Therefore, the co-workers wanted to go out to help the churches in all the localities and to strengthen the meetings in every place. In January 1937 Brother Nee called a co-workers&rsquo; conference in Shanghai in which he spoke about the principle of Acts 13; the messages in this conference began a line of fellowship that was later included in the book <em>Rethinking the Work,</em> now titled <em>The Normal Christian Church Life.</em> Brother Nee specifically pointed out that a servant of the Lord should not stay in one place for a long time but should go out. The Lord gives us the light of the truth, not just for ourselves but for all of God&rsquo;s children. Brother Nee hoped that a few brothers could bear some responsibility to release the light of the truth in many places. However, our going out at that time did not reap much blessing.</p>
<p>On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident triggered the Sino-Japanese War. On August 13 a battle broke out in Shanghai, and the entire country was in turmoil. The government decided to resist the Japanese invasion to the bitter end. The churches along the coast were affected by the war, and many brothers and sisters decided to move inland. On the one hand, they moved because of government policy, and on the other hand, they feared being massacred by the Japanese. At that time the stronger localities were all in the coastal provinces. Brother Nee felt that this retreat was probably the Lord&rsquo;s will and that we should take the gospel, the truth, and the Lord&rsquo;s testimony inland, behind the battle front. Therefore, in November Brother Nee called a co-workers&rsquo; conference in Hankow and spoke again, this time more formally, on the principle of Antioch. Although I went to Hankow for this conference, I was forced to return to the north to care for my family because the situation in northern China was very pressing due to the war. The messages given in the conference in Hankow were edited into the book <em>Rethinking the Work</em> in the fall of 1937. Later, many brothers and sisters retreated from the front; thus, during the Sino-Japanese War churches were raised up in Chungking and Chengtu in Szechwan Province. Brothers Chang Yu-lan and Cheng Ta-chiang were saved during this time.</p>
<p>In 1938 Brother Nee visited England again and fellowshipped with Brother Sparks; he returned to China in the summer of 1939. By that time Nanking had already fallen to the Japanese, so we met in the foreign concession in Shanghai. Because the area outside the foreign concession was under Japanese authority, we were cut off from fellowship with the rest of the country. In August 1939, after Brother Nee had returned to China, he held a conference, hoping that many people would be able to attend. Because travel was difficult due to the war, not many people came; however, I participated in that conference.</p>
<p>I personally received much help in that conference. The messages were on the Body of Christ. The conference was a great turning point among us, and a major aspect of that turn was an emphasis on the inner life and on arriving at the knowledge of the Body through the resurrection life. After the conference Brother Nee was burdened to hold a training in Shanghai. In 1940 he started a training in Shanghai&rsquo;s Yu-hwa Village; the training was held continuously for two years. By that time there were many localities throughout China, and the church in Shanghai was a very large church with several hundred members.</p>
<p>At the end of 1941 the Japanese began the war in the Pacific and took over the foreign concession in Shanghai; they also organized false Christian groups. At the same time some big problems occurred among us. As a result of these troubles from within and without, the meetings in Shanghai were formally discontinued in the second half of 1942. After the Japanese occupied China, the country was divided into two regions, the northern region and the southern region. The churches held their meetings secretly, and there was not much communication among the brothers. Although churches had been raised up in the inland areas, it was still not easy for localities to fellowship with one another.</p>
<p>For about four years, beginning in 1940, the Lord worked strongly in northern China. The churches in northwestern China had a very strong beginning. Moreover, the churches in northeastern China were strengthened. Thus, during the Sino-Japanese War, although the church in Shanghai experienced problems, the churches in northern China made a turn, learning and realizing many necessary things.</p><h2 class="head3">The Revival after the War</h2>
<p>After the war was over, Shanghai and Nanking became the center of the entire country. The daily lives of the brothers and sisters returned to normal, and communications were opened between the north and the south. For five or six years we had not been able to see each other, and everything had been a difficult trial. Everyone had learned many lessons through their personal hardships. Thus, when the meetings and fellowship resumed, the brothers and sisters combined the lessons they had learned during the war with what they had known before it. There was a great turn in Shanghai and Nanking in 1947 and 1948. Not only were the meetings restored in Shanghai, but there was a revival. In 1948 there were meetings in seventeen districts in Shanghai with approximately sixteen hundred saints.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1948 several co-workers from Shanghai went to fellowship with the saints in Fukien and Canton, resulting in a turn in those places as well. When they returned to Shanghai, Brother Nee held a conference. Because the arrangements for the conference were made well in advance, saints came from the western, central, northern, and northwestern regions of China; thus, that time of fellowship can be considered a conference. For six years, from 1942 to 1948, Brother Nee had not been able to formally minister, so that conference was the resumption of his ministry. The Lord blessed the conference. Brother Nee continued his burden from the Shanghai conference at Kuling in Foochow, where he held the first co-workers&rsquo; training. The training lasted for four months. Because of the turn in Shanghai, Canton, and Fukien, in addition to the situation in the northeast, the northwest, and the north after the war, the condition of the churches was glorious. Therefore, all areas of the country experienced an atmosphere of revival; the brothers everywhere had a seeking heart and were willing to be for the Lord.</p>
<p>At the end of 1948 and the beginning of 1949 there was a revival throughout the country, which brought in an unprecedented golden age; it was not difficult for ten thousand people to be saved every month. The fire of revival, the spirit of the gospel, the zeal for the service, and even the material offerings reached unprecedented levels. There were meetings in all places with ports, train stations, and provincial councils. Soon, however, we met with a great problem&mdash;the rise of the Chinese Communist Party. We knew that the Communists would not allow religious freedom or even allow the church to exist. We had much prayer before the Lord concerning this, beseeching Him to care for and remember His church and to care for our country; however, we were not able to save the situation. In the beginning of 1949 two or three hundred brothers went to Taiwan with their government units, schools, or hospitals; some were scattered around Taipei, some were in Chiayi, and some were in Kaohsiung.</p>
<p>At that time the co-workers faced a dilemma; because we saw the situation changing before our eyes, we had to decide whether to stay in mainland China or leave. We knew that the churches in mainland China would have difficulties. If the co-workers left, how would the churches go on? This dilemma bothered us. The leading co-workers had two meetings for thorough fellowship related to this matter. Some brothers advocated leaving because of the practical situation and because we were sure that we would be dealt with by the Communists if we stayed. Others felt that if the co-workers left China, it would be a great loss to the churches. Therefore, we did not make a formal decision to stay or leave but decided that each person should follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to stay or leave; no one would decide for another person. Many brothers and sisters left mainland China, some going to foreign countries or Hong Kong and some following the Nationalist government to Taiwan. In 1949 we foresaw the difficulties that the brothers and sisters in mainland China are facing today. However, in those two co-workers&rsquo; meetings, the leading brothers all agreed that I should go to Taiwan.</p>
<p>In April 1949 Brother Nee went to Kuling to begin the second training. Then the Communists crossed the Yangtze River. When they crossed the Yangtze River, all the co-workers were attending the training at Kuling; only Sister Ruth Lee and I were left in Shanghai. Please forgive me for saying some things about myself again. April 25, 1949, seven years ago, was my worst day in Shanghai. Nanking had already fallen to the Communists, and the Communist army had reached as far as Kun Mountain near Soochow; it seemed that Shanghai would fall very soon. I was responsible for the construction of the meeting hall in Shanghai, and although I knew how cruel the Communists were, I felt that I could not forsake my responsibility. Because Sister Ruth Lee was responsible for putting out the publications, she had a responsibility to bear. Because I had overseen the construction of the meeting hall from the beginning to the end, I had a strong burden. The building lacked only windows, plaster, and paint; the framing work was already completed. My wife asked me, &ldquo;If we women and children do not leave, we will be all right, but what will you do?&rdquo; I could only put myself into the Lord&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>On April 28 Brother Nee sent me a telegram from Foochow, telling me in a very commanding tone to turn over the construction of the meeting hall to the brothers in Shanghai and quickly come to Kuling. I was more sorrowful than I am able to express. I could only confess that it was the Lord&rsquo;s will, that He was stripping me so that I would take Him as my goal. I am human; I loved China, I loved the work in mainland China, I loved the church in Shanghai, and I loved the meeting hall in Shanghai. The location of the meeting hall in Shanghai was very good. It was more than four times larger than the meeting hall in Taipei, and it was a perfect square. It was a good place to preach the gospel because on all four sides the roads had connections to both the bus routes and the electric car routes, and it was in the center of Shanghai&rsquo;s residential district. There was a small park next to it, which looked from the window like it was our own garden. On April 29, the day after I received Brother Nee&rsquo;s telegram, I bought my ticket, and I arrived in Taiwan on April 30. From Taiwan I went to Foochow to fellowship with the brothers in Kuling and then quickly returned to Taiwan. The work also ordained at that time that some young brothers and sisters who were learning how to serve would also go to Taiwan. They came in two groups; one group arrived safely, but the other group did not. The boat on which they were sailing got as far as Wu Sung Kou, but because the boat was old and leaky, the captain was afraid that he would not make it to Taiwan; thus, he turned around and went back to Shanghai. No one in that group of brothers and sisters was able to come out of mainland China.</p>
<p>In September 1949, after the training at Kuling ended, Brother Nee returned to Shanghai to help the church there. At the beginning of the Communist takeover, most of the believers were still relatively free. After the Communists arrested Brother Nee in 1952 and accused him publicly, they went on to arrest more than one thousand leading brothers in all the localities. Thus, the churches in mainland China have been completely entrapped in difficulties and persecution; we cannot describe their sufferings in detail.</p><h2 class="head3">Raising Up Churches in Taiwan</h2>
<p>When I arrived in Taiwan in 1949, the church in Taipei was the only relatively large church on the island. We met in a Japanese-style house on Shanghai Road, which is presently Lin Sen South Road; there were about one hundred people in the meetings, eighty to ninety percent of whom had come from the mainland. Brothers Chang Wu-chen, Sun Feng-lu, Liu Hsiao-liang, and Chao Ching-huai had been sent by the co-workers in mainland China to Taiwan at the end of 1948. Because the church in Taipei was small and weak, the co-workers asked these four brothers to take the responsibility to lead the church. This was the first strengthening of the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>In January 1949 Brother Chang Yu-lan and more than seventy brothers and sisters from the College of Medicine run by the Nationalist government&rsquo;s Department of Defense arrived in Taiwan. They were the second strengthening of the church in Taipei. Brother Chang Yu-lan had been a responsible brother in the church in Nanking; thus, when he came to Taipei, he was brought into taking the lead in Taipei. In May the Lord led me to Taiwan, and even more saints came at that time; that was the third strengthening of the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>The second largest church in Taiwan was the church in Kaohsiung. Brother Lin Mu-hsiang and his family were gained by the Lord in Chefoo in 1942 and 1943; after China won the Sino-Japanese War, he was sent by the Nationalist government to collect port duties in Kaohsiung. When he and his wife arrived in Kaohsiung, they began to meet in their own home. At the end of 1948 Brothers Chu Hsun-min and Cheng Ta-chiang came to Kaohsiung from Tsingtao and Shanghai respectively. Several of their colleagues also came to Kaohsiung. Through this, the church in Kaohsiung was strengthened. Thus, there were two relatively strong churches in Taiwan, one in the northern part and one in the southern part of the province.</p>
<p>A brother who recently graduated from the engineering department of the National Chiao Tung University came to Keelung in 1948 for an engineering apprenticeship at the Keelung Shipyards. Before he left Shanghai, he had a lengthy time of fellowship with me; he did not want to leave Shanghai and was afraid that by being alone in Keelung he would miss the spiritual leading in Shanghai. However, he accepted the arrangement because of the circumstances. When he arrived in Keelung, he met Brother Lee Wei-yi from Nanking, who was working as an engineer at a fertilizer factory, and they began to meet.</p>
<p>The church in Taichung began in the same way when brothers came there from the mainland. Brothers Abel Chu and Liu Chiu-fei arrived first; they were both serving in the Air Force. One was a chemical engineer, and the other was assistant director of a medical college. When they arrived in Taichung, they began to meet.</p>
<p>In 1949 there was no church in Chiayi. A sister named Chu Chih-pu worked as a health educator in Chiayi, and before I visited the southern part of the island for the second time, she wrote a letter asking me to visit her. When I went, I met Brother Liu Kuang-chih. They used a public place in Sister Chu&rsquo;s workplace to begin to have prayer meetings.</p>
<p>The church in Hsinchu began through Sister Chu Chih-pu and some other sisters who went to Hsinchu to teach health education. Later, Brother Cheng Pao-chih graduated from teachers&rsquo; college and went to Hsinchu to teach school; this strengthened the church in Hsinchu.</p>
<p>In this way the churches were raised up. According to our statistics, about four hundred brothers and sisters came to Taiwan from mainland China in the earliest group. They were scattered in the large cities throughout the province. These brothers and sisters were seeds sown by the Lord, and they raised up churches in locality after locality. At present there are fifty-nine localities, and not one was established through the Lord&rsquo;s workers. All these churches were raised up through working brothers and sisters who moved to various places for their jobs.</p>
<p>At the end of July 1949 we moved Hall 1 of the church in Taipei to its present location. The previous meeting hall only seated three hundred people. On August 1 we formally began the work with the first conference; that conference was the official beginning of the work in Taiwan. Three months from today it will have been seven years since we began the work. In these seven years, aside from those brothers in outlying areas who are building up the local service, we have carried out the following main items of work.</p><h2 class="head4">Conferences</h2>
<p>We have had one conference per year except in 1955 and this year, in which we have had two conferences. This makes a total of nine conferences. These conferences include the time when Brother Sparks came to visit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Long-term Bible Study</h2>
<p>The first study we made of the Bible was to examine sixty topics related to the fundamental truths in the Bible; that is, we studied sixty crucial topics from the Bible one by one.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Publication Work</h2>
<p>We have the publication work of the Gospel Book Room, which publishes spiritual books and hymnals as well as a monthly publication called <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em></p>
<h2 class="head4">Trainings</h2>
<p>Since the work is still in the early stages, all of our trainings have been short-term, but they have helped the churches.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our work, through which we help the saints in all the local churches, is in four main areas. Thank the Lord that during these seven years we have seen the Lord&rsquo;s blessing on these four matters. The edification from the messages in every conference is a blessing. During the conferences, the leading brothers from all the localities come together and fellowship with each other so that the grace from one locality can quickly flow to the entire country; this is an even greater blessing. It is also a blessing that during the conferences we can examine our problems and make some corrections. Despite the fact that our trainings are short-term, they have been helpful to those bearing responsibility for the service in the localities. The publication work has also been greatly blessed by the Lord so that we have put out many spiritual books in addition to the publication of <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em> These books supply the saints with truths concerning baptism, the Lord&rsquo;s table, leaving the denominations, and other topics; the saints have received much revelation from God through the publication work. These four matters&mdash;conferences, long-term Bible study, the publication work, and trainings&mdash;are related to our move and work; in addition, there have been spiritual recoveries. I hope that the Lord will continue to bless us and grace us in the fellowship.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL RECOVERIES AMONG US</h1>
<p>The spiritual recoveries among us are the most precious part of our history. The history of how God has blessed us is focused not on acts or actions but on spiritual things. The sequence of these spiritual recoveries is very meaningful, just as it was with God&rsquo;s recoveries in Protestantism. We should not be proud, but we should speak the truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>All of the truth recovered among us began with the matter of salvation. The gospel was preached in China for many years, and many lovers of the Lord gave themselves to sow the seeds of the gospel. However, the Chinese believers were not clear about the matter of salvation until God began to work among us. In 1933 I went to Soochow to preach the gospel in an evangelistic hospital run by the Presbyterians. It was a large hospital, having fifty or sixty students in its nursing school alone. I was invited to stay at the hospital and preach the gospel to the nursing school students. I had the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and almost all the students who had not been saved were clearly saved.</p>
<p>Once they invited me to preach the gospel in the hospital&rsquo;s chapel, and I preached from John 3:16. I told them that although they may have believed, they needed to know whether they had eternal life. This was a heavy word, and it was striking to the ears. The presiding pastor was off to the side of the room, and his gestures indicated that he did not agree with me. He kept making faces at me, trying to stop me from speaking in this way. I pointed my finger at him and said, &ldquo;You are a pastor, and you still do not know whether you are saved.&rdquo; Later, this pastor told some people that I was wrongly preaching the gospel. He said that no good Christian could know with certainty whether he was saved until the judgment at the great white throne. This was the prevailing atmosphere in Christianity in those days. People were saved, but they did not understand the truth regarding the assurance of salvation.</p>
<p>The recovery of the assurance of salvation began when Brother Nee published several messages concerning salvation, such as &ldquo;The Assurance of Salvation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do You Know that You Are Saved?&rdquo; Subsequently, many brothers and sisters in China gave testimonies of being clear about their salvation. The struggle for this truth continued until Japan invaded China; the Sino-Japanese War began before this truth prevailed. Initially, the battle for this truth was severe; many pastors rose up and accused us of being too bold and too proud. They said, &ldquo;Even as elderly pastors, we do not dare say that we are saved. You have simple experiences and think that you can say that you are saved.&rdquo; However, the truth that a person is saved as soon as he believes is now preached everywhere; even those who formerly opposed us are preaching this truth. In this matter we fought the good fight.</p>
<p>Luther recovered the way of salvation through justification by faith, but he did not recover the assurance of salvation. The assurance of salvation was first recovered by the Brethren, and the booklet <em>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment</em> by George Cutting made this truth clear. <em>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment</em> ranks third in sales worldwide after only the Bible and <em>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress.</em></p>
<p>Although people were saved in the past, they did not know that they were saved, and they did not have the joy of salvation. Since they did not know that they were saved, they did not have the assurance of salvation. George Cutting testified that people can not only be saved by faith but that they can immediately know that they are saved and thereby have the joy of salvation. This truth was recovered in the West; the recovery of the assurance of salvation among us began after this truth was released by the Brethren. The assurance of salvation has been fully recovered among Chinese Christians; not only do we confess this truth, but also all the orthodox preachers confess it as well. This is the first item of the recovery&mdash;the assurance of salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Although the Baptist Church existed and sent brothers to China who baptized people, the battle for the truth concerning baptism did not really begin until God raised us up in China. Brother Nee&rsquo;s family first belonged to the Methodist denomination, in which they were sprinkled. After they were clearly saved and saw in God&rsquo;s Word the truth of baptism by immersion, they went to fellowship about it with Miss M. E. Barber. Miss Barber had already seen this matter. She brought this recovery concerning baptism to Foochow, and Brother Nee was baptized by immersion there in March 1921. From that time onward, baptism has been an important item of recovery among us.</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit works, He does the same thing everywhere. Over the past fifty years many people who were raised up by God were initially baptized by sprinkling. After they began to pursue the Lord, they realized that sprinkling is not according to the Bible, because there should be a burial in baptism; thus, they were baptized by immersion. Many believers had this kind of experience.</p>
<p>Mr. Chia Yu-ming, a Presbyterian pastor, was very influential in a particular seminary. He strongly opposed the practice of immersing those who had been baptized by sprinkling. One day as he was praying on a mountain, he was filled with the Holy Spirit to the extent that he went running and jumping for joy down the mountain. He jumped into a pond and baptized himself by immersion. The work of the Holy Spirit caused people to be baptized by immersion; it is not an outward ritual but the result of the inward sense of life. Thus, we should not despise baptism by immersion.</p>
<p>If the New Testament was only concerned with the spiritual aspect and not the practical aspect of baptism, the Lord would not have repeatedly exhorted us to be baptized by immersion. Matthew 28:19 says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Mark 16:16 says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; These verses are both related to baptism. There are several examples of salvation in the book of Acts, and in each case the ones who were saved asked to be baptized by immersion. In Acts 8 Philip preached the gospel to a eunuch; Philip was not caught away by the Holy Spirit after the eunuch received the gospel but after the eunuch was baptized (vv. 26-39). In this example, Philip must have spoken to the eunuch about baptism immediately after preaching the gospel to him; if he had not done so, how could the eunuch have said, &ldquo;Look, water. What prevents me from being baptized?&rdquo; (v. 36). He did not even understand the book of Isaiah, so how could he have known about baptism? Philip must have spoken to him about it; thus, he was baptized beside the road. The spiritual aspect of baptism is certainly important.</p>
<p>We passed through a time of fierce spiritual battle concerning baptism by immersion. For quite a long period of time, people criticized and slandered us, saying that as a matter of regulation we received only those who had been baptized by immersion and that those who had been baptized by sprinkling had to be re-baptized before we would accept them. This was a false accusation against us. Nevertheless, baptism by immersion was the second recovery among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE BREAKING OF BREAD</h2>
<p>In Catholicism, the breaking of bread was transmuted into the holy communion of the mass. Protestantism to some extent corrected the superstition involved in the breaking of bread but in principle retained the old form of Catholicism. Communion in the Roman Catholic mass is filled with superstition. Roman Catholics believe that communion can cure illness and keep people in prosperity and peace. Despite the superstition in the Roman Catholic practice, Protestants continue to use the term <em>holy communion,</em> which is an error. <em>Holy communion</em> is a Catholic term. The Bible uses the phrase <em>eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper</em> (1 Cor. 11:20). When Catholicism uses the word <em>holy</em> in the context of the Lord&rsquo;s supper, it means that the bread and wine which have passed through the ritual blessing of the clergy have physically become the Lord&rsquo;s body and are holy. This is superstition.</p>
<p>All believers are equal at the Lord&rsquo;s table. In the New Testament, God does not have a group of intermediaries between Him and His people. Only the Lord and His disciples were present at the Lord&rsquo;s supper; there were only two groups of people, not three. However, the Roman Catholic Church interposes a third group&mdash;the priests. The priests, who are professional clergy, distribute the bread to the congregation in a ceremony they call holy communion; only the priests drink the wine. During the Reformation, not only did Roman Catholic terminology remain in use, but the same general way of doing things was also kept. In Protestantism, only the clergy can distribute the bread and the cup. If a certain congregation wants to have the Lord&rsquo;s supper when their minister is out of town, they cannot distribute the bread. This is a great departure from what should be the situation in the bread-breaking meeting; the flavor of the saints&rsquo; direct contact with the Lord and their mutual fellowship in the one loaf of the Body of Christ has been completely invalidated.</p>
<p>In 1922 the brothers in Foochow broke away from these erroneous teachings. There were no priests or ministers among them, nor did they have a chapel, yet they all sat before the Lord around the bread and cup in a brother&rsquo;s home and fellowshipped directly with God. That meeting was the beginning of the recovery of the truth of the breaking of bread. This was the third recovery.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY<br />
OF LEAVING ORGANIZATIONS</h2>
<p>The fourth recovery is leaving, or coming out from, organizations. Leaving organizations refers to leaving the organizations of Christianity. Thank God that the gospel, the truth, the Bible, the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s name, and His salvation came to China through the Western missionaries. We thank God for this, and we also thank the missionaries. However, after we were enlightened, we saw that the missionaries also brought organizations with them. Anyone who was saved within a certain organization was spontaneously brought into that organization. All the denominations and missions are like this. Problems in the church that cannot be resolved by the believers themselves must be taken to a mission board or denominational headquarters for a solution. Moreover, when a person receives the gospel and is baptized among a particular group, he becomes a member of that organization.</p>
<p>In 1922 the brothers in Foochow received the Lord&rsquo;s leading to leave organizations. They were outside of organizations and served the Lord in a clean, pure way. Regrettably, they did not have enough light; thus, a problem arose among them when a brother wanted to be ordained. This problem resulted in division. The situation of division in Foochow was not fully resolved even when we left mainland China. Brother Nee published <em>The Christian</em> from 1925 until 1927, and in it he severely criticized the organizations in Christianity, based upon the light that he had seen. In 1934 the move to leave the denominations reached a high tide; we saw people everywhere leaving the denominations. Some were overzealous in the way that they left, but in principle, they all were correct.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
INDIVIDUAL FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>The recovery of individual fellowship with the Lord includes individual reading of the Lord&rsquo;s Word, keeping morning watch, and prayer in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Although I was not present at the beginning of this recovery, I heard that it was very good. Most of the believers involved in this recovery were young people. As students, they would habitually play sports together, and later they would gather in groups in the shade of trees to read the Bible and pray. Thus, individual fellowship with the Lord was a strong recovery. These practices are part of our heritage and still exist among us. We should not emphasize other things while neglecting individual fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF SERVICE AND<br />
OF ZEAL FOR THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Formerly, when a person believed in Jesus, he merely became a church member; the better believers made monetary offerings, and the best ones entered seminaries. Therefore, all matters of service fell to the pastors. Although some believers testified and brought others to believe in the Lord, the matter of all the saints preaching the gospel and serving was not recovered until we were raised up. The brothers recovered the functioning of all the saints; there was no need for a believer to be a member of the clergy in order to serve and preach the gospel. Students could preach the gospel after classes, and other saints could preach the gospel whenever they went out. Now when we preach the gospel, all the brothers and sisters participate. This is truly a recovery.</p>
<p>Several times the brothers and sisters have mistaken me for a gospel friend. Once as I was walking from the bus stop to Hall 3 and was still somewhat far from the meeting hall, a brother invited me to come hear the gospel. There were many ushers along the road, and they welcomed me warmly. I was not recognized until I reached the door of the meeting hall. The same thing happened another time as I went to Hall 4; before I arrived at the meeting hall, the brothers and sisters began urging me to come and hear the gospel. Inwardly, I rejoiced, because their actions showed that they preach the gospel voluntarily and bring many people to salvation. Although we did not know each other, the whole situation was very encouraging. This blessing was left to us by the brothers who went before us and who recovered the service and the zeal for the gospel; it is our spiritual inheritance.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF LIVING BY FAITH</h2>
<p>Formerly, almost no one among the believers in China lived by faith before God. Sister Dora Yu had this experience to some extent, but there was not a solid testimony of living by faith until we were raised up. In the past, people first agreed upon a salary and then began to serve the Lord. We saw this problem with many people. In Harbin, a congregation was recently raised up; they offered to hire Pastor Ting Li-mei for two hundred silver dollars a month. However, Ting Li-mei would not agree to it. My sister graduated from a theological seminary, and in her letters to the family she used to tell us which places paid more and which places paid less. At that time, the matter of living by faith had not been recovered.</p>
<p>When the Lord raised us up in China, the brothers were an anti-testimony. They said that the servants of God should live by trusting in God. In the beginning it was very difficult for the brothers and sisters. The beginning of anything is not easy, but the brothers fought the good fight. Whenever I heard their testimonies, I felt that God was working in them. Regrettably, some people soon damaged this matter. Some spiritually gifted persons began to travel to preach the Word, receiving support from many places. May the Lord have mercy on us not to take this way; it is wrong to take a salary from a church organization, and it is wrong to take money for itinerant preaching, taking advantage of a spiritual gift. For example, some traveling preachers have a special announcement at the beginning and end of every meeting that there will be a collection for the speaker. This kind of situation existed here in Taipei just a few years ago. This is a deformed practice of living by faith.</p>
<p>Some people have asked why we do not go out more often to hold conferences, because if we held more conferences, we would probably get more money. We cannot hold conferences if it seems that we are holding them just for money. We are pitiful people without faith, but because the Lord has had mercy on us, there are some kinds of support that we can receive and some that we cannot. This is especially true for the young brothers and sisters; if they do not take care of monetary matters properly, it is better for them to take jobs instead of serving the Lord full time.</p>
<p>The first time I went to Manila, I stayed there for five and a half months, and before I returned to Taiwan, the elders in Manila discussed the needs of Taiwan behind my back. I knew about it; they discussed it in the elders&rsquo; meeting on at least two occasions. I solemnly beseeched the brothers not to make any announcements to the saints. The Lord does not send us out to ask for money; that kind of thing is low and despicable. We are forced by the environment to speak such foolish things. The recovery of living by faith is the seventh recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF FELLOWSHIP IN MUTUAL LOVE</h2>
<p>Many among us were members in a denomination; therefore, we are aware of the general situation in Christianity. In 1922 a few brothers were raised up, and they began to love one another and have fellowship with one another. They had the condition of Philadelphia to a much greater degree than we have it today. However, thank the Lord that the mutual love is still here today. This, too, is one of the important early recoveries among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF BEING CALLED</h2>
<p>Before we were raised up by the Lord, being a preacher was considered a profession; it did not matter if a person had been called by God. I know of a mother who educated her brightest child in medicine, her second-brightest child in business, and consecrated her least intelligent child to the church to study theology. This is the human concept. I had an irresponsible classmate who began working in the news media but was not very successful. Less than six months after I was saved, he came to me one day and said, &ldquo;I heard that you have believed in Jesus and that you are very zealous. Could you give me an introduction to your church? I would like to go to your church and be a preacher.&rdquo; These two examples show that most people have the impression that being a preacher is low and base.</p>
<p>When Western missionaries came to China they had a difficult time finding proper helpers. Preachers had such a low status that many of them were false and were not raised up by God. Only when we were raised up in China was the matter of being called by the Lord recovered. We saw that being a servant of the Lord is a matter of being called. When someone is called by God, God commissions that person to do His work. The truth that all the saints should serve God and that all the believers are priests has been recovered. The matter of being called, however, applies to those who work solely for God. If a person has not been called, he should remain at his job.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF DIRECT REVELATION FROM GOD</h2>
<p>A person who has truly been called does not need to study theology. Over the past twenty or thirty years, the Lord has raised up many people who never studied theology. Most of those who have studied theology have no spiritual weight. Organized Christianity considers pastoring a profession and theology a skill. The study of theology is treated as if a person is equipping himself with a skill in order to engage in a certain profession; someone who wants to be a doctor studies medicine, and someone who wants to be a pastor studies theology. Yenching University, Chi-lu University, and St. John&rsquo;s University all have theological seminaries; moreover, there are many schools that teach theology exclusively. The thought is that in order to be a pastor, one must first study theology. After the Lord raised us up, there was a testimony that believers could receive revelation directly from God and do not need to study theology. This was a recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE</h2>
<p>Brother Nee told us that 1928 was a year of strong recoveries. Although there were many recoveries in the beginning in 1920, we still had not recovered the matter of spiritual warfare. Spiritual warfare was not recovered until the first overcomer conference in 1928. The messages in that conference were on God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, the kingdom of God, and the way to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. At that time the matter of spiritual warfare was recovered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF TAKING CHRIST AS THE CENTER<br />
AND OF THE OVERCOMERS</h2>
<p>In early 1934, in the third overcomer conference, Brother Nee shared on Christ as God&rsquo;s centrality and universality and on God&rsquo;s overcomers. The messages in this conference were very high, and they released a great recovery to the brothers and sisters in China.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE</h2>
<p>During the three years from 1934 to 1936, we emphasized the matter of the overcoming life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the past we were not clear concerning the spreading of the church from Antioch. This light did not become clear to us until 1937.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF KNOWING THE BODY</h2>
<p>We began to see the matter of knowing the Body in 1938 and 1939.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY<br />
OF SERVICE IN COORDINATION</h2>
<p>In 1939 and 1940, after we began to know the Body, we started to see the service in coordination in the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The matter of the church preaching the gospel was completely recovered in the years between 1940 and 1943. This recovery reached its peak in northern China. Whenever the church preached the gospel, it involved all the saints moving together; that was a living and strong recovery. The best time period was in 1942 and 1943, when the entire church preached the gospel; everyone opened his home for the gospel. The entire church served in all aspects of the gospel work, including inviting friends, visiting people, and leading people to be saved. At that time the gospel was countless times stronger than it is today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF MIGRATION</h2>
<p>At the beginning of 1943 we saw the light of migration; the gospel spreads not only through the preaching of the apostles but also through the migration of the saints. Wherever the saints go, the gospel is planted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
EXPERIENCING THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The recovery of experiencing the indwelling Christ began after 1942 and continued through the end of the Sino-Japanese War. The experience of the indwelling Christ is deeper than knowing the overcoming life. Many brothers and sisters went through trials during the war and learned these lessons very well. Although they had known the overcoming life and recognized Christ as life in their being, their experience was not up to the standard of experiencing the indwelling Christ. Everyone, especially some weighty brothers and sisters, passed through trials at the end of the war, and in many places the work stopped completely. Therefore, many brothers and sisters pursued the inner fellowship with the Lord and learned to experience the indwelling Christ. Thus, after the war ended, many messages spontaneously emphasized this matter.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF GIVING ALL FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S USE</h2>
<p>The recovery of giving all for the Lord&rsquo;s use is still practiced among us (cf. Acts 2:44). In 1943 in northern China, the flow of the Holy Spirit was so strong that of eight hundred brothers and sisters, more than ninety percent placed their all into the Lord&rsquo;s hands&mdash;not merely in prayer or in word, but even more, they placed everything practically in the Lord&rsquo;s hands. I was present at that time, and there are other saints among us today who were in that flow. That was an unprecedented occurrence since the church came to China.</p>
<p>If it had not been for the war between China and Japan, more than three hundred brothers and sisters would have migrated to the northwest. The first migration to the northwest included more than seventy people; another thirty went to Korea and to the border of Manchuria. The brothers and sisters who went to the northwest in the spring of 1943 raised up meetings in more than forty places in less than one year.</p>
<p>The first group to migrate did not have much education and was somewhat weak. One brother&rsquo;s father-in-law was a doctor, and he was probably the most highly educated person among that migrating group; that family is still in the northwest today. However, when this group of saints consecrated themselves and all that they had and placed it in the Lord&rsquo;s hands, God did marvelous things through them. That recovery still influences us today. It is a pity that when it happened, we did not record all the details.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy on us and make us humble, because after we have recovered a spiritual item, it cannot be kept in oldness. We must live every day in newness, and we must renew our vision daily in order to be able to continue the former things. Otherwise, we will not experience anything new, and we will lose even the old things.</p>
<p>During the revival in northern China in 1943, Brother Sun Feng-lu said to me, &ldquo;I feel that the condition of the church today is just like the condition of the church on the day of Pentecost.&rdquo; He suggested that we should make a record of what was happening because so many things were God&rsquo;s wonderful working and demonstrated the work of the Holy Spirit. Regrettably, those things passed without being recorded. It would be difficult at this point for me to recall what happened and write something about it. It would require special grace from the Holy Spirit to remember everything that happened; we really had the Lord&rsquo;s presence. One brother, a doctor, was very proud and had a terrible temper; everyone was afraid of him. However, in that flow of revival, the Lord gained him strongly. Even today, thirteen years later, that brother is diligently following the Lord. That flow was very strong.</p>
<p>When a person is graced with being part of one of God&rsquo;s special moves on this earth, it is the greatest blessing of his life. God&rsquo;s move makes an impression that he will never forget, and it becomes an unending source of supply to him. Whoever can participate in such a flow is most blessed. I believe that whenever someone who was in such a flow thinks back on it, he will have fond memories of that time. The revival in northern China in 1943 was a very strong flow; many people were gained by God at that time. Many of the consecrations were not loose but were very strong. That flow of revival had a great influence on the churches in China after the war ended. It is a great blessing for a person to be able to participate in the flow of God&rsquo;s work, the flow of revival, at least once in his lifetime.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">OUR ATTITUDE IN THIS AGE</h1>
<p>If we want to know what attitude we should have toward today&rsquo;s Christianity, we must understand God&rsquo;s attitude toward Christianity. We should have God&rsquo;s attitude toward Christianity in the present age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ATTITUDE</h2>
<p>The light and prophecies in the New Testament show God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and His attitude toward Christianity in this age. On one hand, God is dissatisfied with the desolated, confused, and transmuted condition of Christianity. God condemns divisions, mixture with the world, human organization by human will, falling into Babylon, and affording opportunities to Satan. On the other hand, although God condemns these things, He does not intend to eliminate these things in this age or even to forbid them. It seems that God not only allows these things to exist but also to continually increase. Thus, the number of sects in Christianity will increase over time, and Christianity will become more and more worldly and confused. God dislikes and condemns these situations, but He seems to allow them to continue. God does not intend to eliminate them immediately, and He does not even limit them. It seems as though God does not control them but allows them to go on freely.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR ATTITUDE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">On the Negative Side&mdash;Not Participating,<br />
Not Interfering, Not Criticizing, and Not Mentioning</h2>
<p>Based on God&rsquo;s attitude, we should have two attitudes toward Christianity. First, if we receive mercy from the Lord, we should not participate in the confused, deformed situation in Christianity. Although God does not eliminate or forbid such an improper condition, He does say, &ldquo;Come out of her, My people&rdquo; (Rev. 18:4). Simply stated, one who lives before God, cares for God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, has inner light, and is willing to pay the price cannot remain in organized Christianity. I am not exhorting people to leave the denominations; this is not a matter of whether a person is in a denomination. Rather, it is a matter of avoiding mixture with the world.</p>
<p>Second, we are foolish if we think that we can alter the condition of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Such thinking assumes that we are greater and more capable than God. Some people say, &ldquo;The churches are divided; let us make them one.&rdquo; Twenty-five years ago I also felt this way; however, I now feel that to say such a thing would indicate that I do not know myself and that to try to do such a thing would be to try to do what God Himself will not do. To hope to correct Christianity and eliminate its mistakes is to be foolish and proud. Who can reform Christianity? We cannot do it because God is not doing it. Of course, if God wanted to do it, He would have a way. However, God&rsquo;s Word shows that He is not reforming Christianity. Since He is not doing it, why should we try?</p>
<p>Therefore, on the one hand, we should not participate in Christianity, and on the other hand, we should not try to intervene in its situation; we should not even criticize Christianity. It is not our place to criticize Christianity. If we understand correctly, we should not even mention the condition of Christianity. When we preach the gospel, give messages, and visit or fellowship with people, we should not mention Christianity. Christianity is not our topic, and we should not intervene in, criticize, or even mention it. Christianity should not be in our eyes and thoughts. This does not mean that because of pride we do not look at anyone else; rather, to have Christianity in our thoughts is a waste of our time because we have no way or ability to do anything helpful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">On the Positive Side&mdash;<br />
Ministering Life and Preaching the Gospel</h2>
<p>On the positive side, we should learn to know life and the Lord&rsquo;s way, how to live in God&rsquo;s presence, and how to be practically joined to God. In addition, we should seize every opportunity to minister life to others and to preach the gospel. The word of the gospel and the word of life should fill our mouths. The one thing we should do in this age is receive mercy from the Lord to stand in the breach and carry out the things the church should do but has not been doing (Ezek. 22:30). The church is the Body of Christ and the place where God is mingled with man; the church is the dwelling place of God for His expression on earth and the place where Christ manifests His victory among men. The church should be these things, but it has fallen short. It is our responsibility to stand in the breach and carry out these things.</p>
<p>If we receive more grace, we should learn to fight for God. The church should fight for God, but it has not been doing so. The church&rsquo;s greatest commission is to preach the gospel to the nations. We should give our all to go everywhere spreading the gospel of God under the leading and by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>However, wherever we go, we should not speak of Christianity. We should not mention it when preaching the gospel or edifying the believers. Christianity is not our topic. The Lord does not want us to speak of Christianity; instead, He has commissioned us with the gospel and with life. We preach the gospel to the world and minister life to the believers.</p><h2 class="head1">OUR PRACTICE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not Seeking to Draw People<br />
and Not Refusing People</h2>
<p>In this age the Lord has commissioned us to preach the gospel and minister life; He has not asked us to touch the situation in Christianity. Even if we are questioned about the situation in Christianity, we should avoid discussing it. We should not answer queries regarding Christianity. I do not know what motives are behind the practices in each locality, but it is wrong to seek to bring people out of Christian groups into our meetings. We should not reject Christians from other Christian groups, but we do not need to seek them out. I do not believe that the Lord wants us to seek out believers from other Christian groups. I believe that the Lord wants us to take the gospel to every place and to minister life to His many children. The Lord wants a situation among us that can influence His children.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, believers from many Christian groups have come to fellowship with us. I am willing and eager to fellowship about spiritual things, but when the topic switches to the church, I avoid discussing it. I am not afraid to discuss the church, but I feel that there is an inward forbidding.</p>
<p>For example, in Hong Kong a young person came to talk to me several times. During our conversations he brought up the church a few times. Another brother who was present told me, &ldquo;If you would simply touch the matter of the church and give him a little help, he will come to be with us.&rdquo; This young person is a pastor, and I have heard that he is very gifted. He repeatedly insisted that I answer him regarding the church, but I could only say, &ldquo;The question of the church cannot be resolved by any person but only by your spiritual life.&rdquo; Although my word was clear and to the point, he did not understand what I said.</p>
<p>The Lord definitely does not want us to lead others into our meetings. Where people meet and how they serve the Lord are entirely between them and the Lord; we cannot intervene in these things. In this age we must minister life to others. When people contact us, they should touch something in us that is unforgettable. The way they take or where they meet does not matter; we should not consider that our meetings are better than those in Christianity or that our meetings have the greatest number of people. Such thoughts are not in resurrection, and we must condemn them. We must also condemn raising up meetings merely for the sake of having meetings. If we raise up meetings in order to minister life, we are proper.</p>
<p>We do not have any intention of competing with or comparing ourselves to others; the thought of competition is fallen. Some brothers like to compare themselves with others, saying, &ldquo;That city would have been a good place to work, but we came a little too late; if we had come earlier, the opportunity would have been ours.&rdquo; This is not a sweet, spiritual, or proper feeling; we should not have such feelings. Are we living in life, resurrection, and the Holy Spirit? Strictly speaking, the Lord does not want us to open up fields for the work or to establish churches. The Lord wants us to preach the gospel and minister life to people. I really hope that our gospel preaching is the going forth of the pure gospel and not just a work; I hope that we are ministering only life to people and that we are not concerned with the visible church meetings.</p>
<p>One brother wrote a letter to his classmates which said, &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s Christianity we should find the place in which we can touch God&rsquo;s presence the most. Today in Taipei the place in which we can touch God&rsquo;s presence the most is with the church in Taipei; therefore, I hope that you will come to meet here.&rdquo; Is this in resurrection? No, this is not in resurrection; this is not something that we should do. None of the brothers and sisters among us should do this kind of work. The Lord has not commissioned us to do such a thing. If someone comes here and touches God&rsquo;s presence, that is between him and God. If he returns to Christianity, that is also between him and God and does not concern us.</p>
<p>If we meet someone who has never contacted Christianity, we should do our best to bring him into the Lord&rsquo;s churches, but we should not announce to people who are already in the realm of Christianity that God&rsquo;s presence is with us or attempt to draw them to meet with us. This is a foolish practice. If they want to come, we should not refuse to receive them. If Christianity misunderstands us because we do not refuse to receive them, that is God&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
<p>A highly-educated woman in her fifties was recently saved. After one meeting she said to me, &ldquo;When I come here, I really feel supplied. Please tell me what I should do.&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;You should go home and make a complete consecration of yourself to the Lord. You should give Him the authority over you, and He will tell you what you should do.&rdquo; This is what we should do; we should not do anything more.</p>
<p>It is not we who gain people but the Lord. We should condemn the aspiration to gain people. Only the Lord can gain people. People can meet in any place. The important thing is for people to be gained by God. We must constantly deal with our motives. God does not want us to be happy only because people come to our meetings. God&rsquo;s blessing upon us is for all to share, and there should be no boundaries dividing God&rsquo;s children. However, we should not use human hands, the hands of Uzzah (2 Sam. 6:6-7), to draw people. We welcome anyone who wants to come to serve and pursue the Lord together with us. Many severe misunderstandings and persecutions have arisen in the past because we do not refuse to receive anyone. This will happen again in the future; it is unavoidable. However, we do not care about persecution. If we try to draw people in or exhort them to meet with us, we have fallen; we should not do such a thing.</p>
<p>The best attitude for us to have toward today&rsquo;s Christianity is to not ask about or concern ourselves with it. This does not mean that we despise the believers in Christianity and are proud. When we meet a sinner, we should do our best to preach the gospel to him; when we meet a child of God, we should do our best to minister life. If someone has something to minister to us, we should humbly receive it.</p>
<p>Christianity should not even exist in our thinking. Our thinking should include only sinners and Christians, not Christianity. Such an attitude is pleasing to God. Whenever we meet a Christian, we should not let Christianity be the focus of our conversation. Rather, I hope that the Lord would give us the mercy, opportunity, way, and grace to minister something of the true spiritual life to such a person. This is enough. Allow the believer&rsquo;s spiritual life and the Holy Spirit to resolve all other questions. I believe that those who live by God&rsquo;s life, are enlightened, and have the inward, heavenly wisdom will take such an attitude.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Establishing &ldquo;Our&rdquo; Meetings</h2>
<p>It would be ideal if in every city there was a church that we were at peace with in our conscience; then there would be no need for us to set up other meetings. However, the practices of some Christians bother our conscience; the way they do things makes it impossible for us to maintain a pure conscience.</p>
<p>The believers should love one another, but we do not love one another merely because we serve the Lord together. Brotherly love is based on whether we can preserve a pure conscience; this is not a debatable doctrinal point. If we can maintain a pure conscience, we can pass through anything. If we can maintain a pure conscience, we absolutely must not establish &ldquo;our&rdquo; meetings in any locality.</p>
<p>The preceding four items are negative&mdash;not participating, not interfering, not criticizing, and not mentioning. On the positive side, we should take every opportunity to preach the gospel to unbelievers and to minister life to believers. This is our attitude.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Caring for Others&rsquo; Criticism<br />
but Standing before God</h2>
<p>As long as we have a proper attitude, we do not need to fear criticism or opposition. We should not expect that there will not be any criticism or opposition; the only thing that we should care about is our standing before God. If we care about what others say and are influenced by them, then we will not properly follow the Lord&rsquo;s way. We must learn to be humble, to not fear the criticisms of others, and to live before the Lord.</p>
<p>It is wrong for some brothers to seek to draw others into our meetings; other brothers are afraid of criticism, and this also is wrong. The proper attitude is to live as though Christianity does not exist and know only of the Lord, sinners, and Christians.</p>
<p>We must learn the lessons of life before the Lord and learn to receive grace to seek opportunities to minister life to others. If someone misunderstands and criticizes us, we should simply let it go. It is not our responsibility. We should not be proud, but if we are afraid of criticism, we are weak. The fact that we do not participate in Christianity will cause some to criticize us; we cannot avoid criticism for not participating in Christianity. We must keep a pure conscience in order to stand on the ground of oneness and walk in the way of oneness. The issue at hand is not of leaving the denominations but of having a pure conscience. The most important thing is to live purely before God.</p></body></html>
