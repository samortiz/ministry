   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Only one third of Charles Stanley's lungs function, yet he is constantly engaged in open-air evangelism.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The audience can range in number from two or three thousand to six or seven thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has been preaching this way for thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He has God's word, and there is no problem for him to work this way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if one does not have God's word, such a thing would be suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we have the Lord's word and can trust in Him, we can rise above all symptoms of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I am sick and I know that God wants to heal me with His word, I only need to deal with His word; I do not have to deal with the sickness itself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If God says that I will be healed, I only need to focus on God's healing; His word will stop my illness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If I continue to deal with the sickness itself, I will make God's word of none effect.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can rejoice when the fever goes down a little, but I do not need to fret when it goes up a little.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If God has a word for us, we do not need to worry even if our fever goes up tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not have to listen to the blood cells, and our eyes do not have to be set on the thermometer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We lay hold of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fever and the blood cells are not our lords.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The white blood cells can increase, but we do not have to worry about them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to learn to obey God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can laugh at the fever; whether it is high or low is not our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to learn to trust in God's word, not the symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have God's word, we have the spiritual reality, and this spiritual reality is more real than the symptoms of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was once sick myself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God gave me His word and healed me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I only knew to answer to God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I only dealt with God's word and refused to deal with the symptoms of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When God said that He had healed me, it meant that He had stopped the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I had dealt with the illness again, I would have made God's word of none effect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I did not rejoice when the fever went down a little, and I did not fret when it went up a little.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>My eyes were not set on my temperature, but on God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My temperature and the number of blood cells were not my lords.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only the Lord is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should learn to smile at our fever and not be concerned with our temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to learn to trust in God's word, not in our symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only God's word is true; the symptoms are false.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If God's word says that we are healed, we are healed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God's word says that we are well, but we still spit blood, this is a time when our faith is being tested.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's word says, "You are healed," but the symptoms say, "You are not healed."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At such times we have to believe in God's word, not in the symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The sickness will change.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In my experience, I was not able to believe at first because I did not have God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But one day His word came.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet the symptoms became worse.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I stood up and said, "Lord, if the symptoms are deceptive, I ask You to rebuke them."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within one or two hours, my sickness was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not forget what the Gospel of John tells us: God's word is truth 17:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I had problem with my lungs, kidneys, and pancreas.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even now I have a problem with my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1923 I had peritonitis for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was in bed for over a month.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I breathed I felt pain.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I had a high fever, and the pain was excruciating.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time Brother Simon Meek gathered some brothers and sisters to pray for me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When he prayed, I did not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Another sister M. E. Barber prayed, "Lord, no one praises You in the grave; if our brother dies, You will not have his praise." As she prayed, something broke through in me, even though the fever was still present, and I was still in pain.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The next day I rose up and went to Lo-hsing Pagoda to work on the first issue of The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we do not have God's word, we should take care of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have God's word, we should never look at the symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We should consider the symptoms temptations and lies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They cannot remain; they have to go.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some sicknesses go away immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once I was sick, and I asked the Lord for healing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord said, "The healing will not come that quick.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But My grace is sufficient for you."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He showed me a ship that was unable to sail on a river because of rocks.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He said, "Do you want Me to remove the rocks so that the ship can go through, or do you want the water level to rise so that it covers the rocks, and the ship can sail through?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I was immediately clear within about the Lord's desire, and I said, "Lord, I do not ask for the removal of the problem but for the increase of grace."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Removing the rocks is one way, and increasing the water level is another way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Both are acceptable, and either is good.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>There is no sickness in this world that a Christian cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we have the Lord's word, our eyes should not be set on the symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must believe that God is faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should only contact God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is no need to look to the symptoms to justify our faith, and there is no need to worry if they contradict our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The rocks may still be around, but the water level has risen, not just a little but a great measure, and the ship is able to sail through.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In summary, there are three things we should pay attention to: First, if we do not have God's word, we should not tempt God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Second, if we have God's word, we should not look at the symptoms.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Third, if we have God's word but are not healed immediately, we should realize that His grace is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Lord has no intention to leave us in sickness without granting us sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Paul was sick, yet he labored more than anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Sickness did not stop Paul from working, nor should it stop us from serving our God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We have to learn to be simple, committing ourselves to the faithful and trustworthy Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord will deal with us according to what is best for us.</S>
