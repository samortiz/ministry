   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-EIGHT THE CHURCH AS A HYBRID LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God s eternal purpose is to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His purpose is not just to create man, to rescue him from his fallen condition, and to bring him to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, God s purpose is not simply to have us be holy, spiritual, and victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Creation, salvation, sanctification, spirituality, and victory are all part of God s procedure to reach His goal, but they are not the goal itself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GOD S PURPOSE IN THE BEGINNING</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to share in the recovery of the proper church life, we need to see what God s purpose was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to understand that there are three different beginnings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The beginning here is the beginning in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis 1:1 says, In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse the beginning denotes the time of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Finally, the beginning also refers to the start of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, to go back to the beginning is to go back to the beginning in eternity, to the beginning in God s creation, or to the beginning of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The book of Ephesians reveals that the church came into existence according to the eternal purpose which God purposed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 3:11 says, According to the purpose of the ages which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of the ages is the purpose of eternity, the eternal purpose, the eternal plan of God made in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the purpose made by God in eternity past for eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is a God of purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before creation, before the foundation of the world, He made a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This plan is the purpose of the ages, or the eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1:9 Paul says, Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse also speaks of God s purpose, but here Paul uses the word purpose as a verb instead of as a noun.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A good pleasure according to God s will has been purposed by God in Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will which He has purposed is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was hidden in God; it was not revealed to the saints in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 1:11 Paul also speaks of God s purpose: In Whom also we were made an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One Who operates all things according to the counsel of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s purpose in these verses refers to what God planned in the beginning, in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the beginning God planned to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible definitely reveals that this is God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items because He desired to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first two chapters of Genesis are apparently a record of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually these chapters reveal God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The minerals are for the plants, the plants are for the animals, the animals are for man, and man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, all things are for us, and we are for God in order that He may fulfill His desire to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, God created all things so that He could have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, God s redemption, regeneration, and calling are also for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God accomplished redemption so He could have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He also came to you, called you, and regenerated you for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, He dwells in you today for the sake of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we come to the crucial and difficult matter of giving a definition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church may be called a hybrid, because it is one entity produced by the mingling together of two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The two lives that are mingled to produce the church are the divine life and the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, the church is an entity constituted not just of the divine life or merely of the human life, but of the divine-human life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a divine-human life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church also has a divine-human life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We thank the Lord that although this has been hidden from the saints for centuries, He has revealed it to us in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is vital to see that the church is a hybrid produced by the mingling of the divine life with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God desires to dispense Himself into man and to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In his book, The Spirit of Christ, Andrew Murray says that the divine life is interwoven with the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Although interwoven is a very good term, it is still not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The divine life is not only interwoven with the human life, but the divine life and the human life are mingled to form one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul s word in Galatians 2:20 illustrates this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here he says, I have been crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>. Paul says that it is he who lives; yet it is not he, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This indicates the mingling of Christ with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is the product of such a mingling.</S>
