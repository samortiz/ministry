TO TAKE GOD AS LIFE</h2>
<p>Adam fell when he took of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thus allowing the element of Satan to enter into him. As a result of Adam&rsquo;s fall, God closed the way to the tree of life, using the cherubim and the flaming sword to guard it (Gen. 3:22-24). This means that the way to God was closed. Cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 9:3; 10:4; Heb. 9:5), the flame signifies God&rsquo;s holiness (Deut. 4:24; 9:3; Heb. 12:29), and the sword signifies God&rsquo;s righteousness (Lam. 3:42-43; Rom. 2:5). God used the cherubim, the flame, and the sword to close the way to the tree of life. This means that His glory, holiness, and righteousness do not permit fallen man, with the element of Satan, to contact Him. Thereafter, no fallen human being on earth could contact God or receive Him as life.</p>
<p>One day God was manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16); there was a man on earth who took God as life (John 1:1, 4, 14). When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He let God be His life. He was a genuine man with the human life and nature. Apart from the fact that He was without sin, He was exactly the same as us. He came to the earth to live as a genuine man, but He took God as life and lived the human life by God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;The living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father&rdquo; (6:57). The phrase <em>because of</em> indicates that although the Lord Jesus was a man, He did not live by Himself; He lived by God. He took God as the factor of His living. Therefore, He could say, &ldquo;The words that I say to you I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who abides in Me does His works&rdquo; (14:10). Apparently, the Lord was speaking, but actually, it was God who was working. This was a man who did not live by His own life but took God as His life. It was not until the Lord Jesus was born that God gained a man on earth. On one hand, the Lord Jesus was a genuine man with His own mind, emotion, and will; He had choices and preferences. On the other hand, He completely denied Himself, put His own life aside, and let God live in Him; He let God be His preferences and choices.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was not without thoughts, but He denied His thoughts and let God think in Him. It was not that He did not know how to choose, but He chose God&rsquo;s choices. He denied everything of Himself and took God as His life. He was a human being, but He lived by God. This is the greatest event in the universe. It is immeasurably greater than God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens, the earth, and all things on the earth. Although the Lord Jesus was only an insignificant man from Nazareth, having no beauty, splendor, or glory, He was mingled with God, and God was His life. This is the greatest and the most mysterious thing in the universe!</p>
<p>God wants to obtain the very same thing in us. We should not think that God wants us to worship Him, serve Him, or do something for Him. God desires that we learn to receive Him and to take Him as our life by denying ourselves, just as the Lord Jesus did.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING GOD AS LIFE THROUGH THE CROSS</h2>
<p>In order to gain His desire, God sent the Lord Jesus to die on the cross. There are two significant aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross: the redemptive aspect in which His blood was shed to deal with man&rsquo;s sins and the life-releasing aspect in which the divine life was released from within Him for man to receive. As descendants of Adam, we have an evil nature within us, and we are sinful. Hence, God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory do not permit us to go before God or to contact Him. For this reason, the Lord Jesus needed to accomplish redemption. On the cross He bore our sins, and He also received the righteous judgment of God, thereby satisfying the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. As a result, He removed the barrier between God and fallen man, and He opened a new and living way to God (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:19-20).</p>
<p>On the cross the Lord Jesus also released the divine life. In John 12:24 He said, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; This verse refers to the life-releasing aspect of His death.</p>
<p>A marvelous thing happened when the Lord died on the cross. According to Roman law, in order for those being crucified to expire quickly, their legs were broken. For this reason, the soldiers broke the legs of the two robbers who were crucified together with the Lord. However, when they came to the Lord, they saw that He had already expired, so they did not break His legs (19:32-33). This fulfilled the words in the Scriptures: &ldquo;No bone of His shall be broken&rdquo; (v. 36; Psa. 34:20). The first time a bone is mentioned in the Scriptures is in Genesis 2:21-23 when God took a rib out of Adam for the producing of Eve. This symbolizes the producing of the church with Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life. Hence, the bone is a figure of Christ&rsquo;s unbreakable resurrection life. The fact that not one of the Lord&rsquo;s bones was broken means that His resurrection life was neither damaged nor subdued by death; rather, it was manifested and released through death.</p>
<p>John 19:34 says that a soldier pierced the Lord&rsquo;s side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water. Blood is for redemption, and water is for imparting life. This water was typified by the water that flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6; 1 Cor. 10:4). Hence, blood and water indicate what the Lord accomplished through His death on the cross. The blood indicates that He accomplished redemption to deal with man&rsquo;s sins, and the water indicates that He released His life for His believers.</p>
<p>Now we can receive the divine life to become His many grains. Just as the Lord had God as His life and lived because of God, so also we can have the Lord&rsquo;s life and live because of Him. His blood dealt with our sins and thus satisfied the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. Therefore, we can contact God with boldness. We can also receive Him as living water so that we can live by Him.</p>
<p>What does it mean to believe in the Lord Jesus? The Lord Jesus has done so much for us. First, when He lived on the earth, He set up a pattern of a genuine man who let God live in Him and also lived by God&rsquo;s life. After living such a pattern, He is now producing many people who are like Him. He was the grain of wheat that fell into the ground in order to produce many grains. On the one hand, He had to shed His blood in order to bear man&rsquo;s sins; on the other hand, He had to release His life in order to impart it into man. Now man can draw near to God with boldness through the Lord&rsquo;s blood, and God can enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life. This fulfills His desire to fill man and flow out of man as living water. This is the issue of believing in the Lord Jesus and receiving Him as life.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in saving us is to enter into us as life. Therefore, after we are saved, we should take heed to letting Him be our life and to letting Him live in us, fill us, and be expressed through us. Our primary responsibility is neither to serve God, to work for Him, to obey His will, nor to worship Him. These are not the primary matters that God wants us to pursue.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Knowing and Experiencing God as Life &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
