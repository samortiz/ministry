<h2 class="head1">TAKING CARE OF NEEDY SAINTS</h2>
<p>Two Western brothers, one of whom was a doctor, were among us for a period of time, but their work was not very profitable. They had a desire to serve with the saints, but we felt that they did not obtain much profit; neither did they render much profit to the brothers and sisters. The lack of profit was not related to edification but to the building up of the church. In relation to the building up of the church, we felt that receiving them into the service would result in a great loss. As those who serve the Lord, we should not gossip or be careless in our conversations about this matter. It is a fact, however, that our contact with these two brothers gave rise to many problems instead of the building up of the church.</p>
<p>According to our realization, problems could arise because we did not fully know what kind of persons these brothers were. We also were not certain what they were able to do or what would be the result of their work. Those who contacted them were confused and unclear. They helped many saints medically for no charge and even paid hospital expenses for some saints. However, all their work resulted in some tearing down of the church, not a building up.</p>
<p>One day my wife and I went to visit the brother who was a doctor. On the way we saw a sister whose child had contracted tuberculosis and had been operated on twice by this brother. The sister felt that it was the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that this brother had charged her only half the fees the first operation and performed the second without charging her. On the one hand, this brother was kind and took care of the poor. On the other hand, the ones he took care of were grateful to him but did not gain more Christ. Hence, it was not for the building up of the church. Furthermore, those whom he helped were not uplifted in their person; instead, they felt that they were inferior to this brother and to the responsible brothers. For this reason, what this brother did in love was actually a tearing down of the church, not a building up.</p>
<p>If this brother had a burden to help the saints materially, he could still accept medical fees and be led by the Lord to put something into the offering box. In this way the brothers and sisters would receive help directly from God&rsquo;s hand. They would not have a feeling of being debased before men; they would not feel that they had received help from man or even from the church. They would simply feel that God had visited them. This would build them up with a noble character.</p>
<p>If our help causes the brothers and sisters to feel inferior or indebted to us, we are tearing down the church rather than building it up. Our help should not cause others to feel grateful to us. In other words, they should not feel inferior to us. They should not feel that they are our beneficiaries. If we give people such a feeling, we are a charitable organization, not the church. The saints should not merely feel grateful to us, the church, or the elders. We must lead them to Christ; only this results in the building of the church.</p>
<p>If we maintain an attitude of giving alms, showing pity, or assisting the poor saints, we are corrupting the Lord&rsquo;s church. Although the sister whose son had contracted tuberculosis repeatedly thanked and praised the Lord, her entire being was corrupted. In her debasement, she became reliant on others and even subservient to them. Those who always receive help from others cannot be built up in their character, and the church cannot be built up. In this matter the two Western brothers truly needed our fellowship. However, we were unable to help them in this matter. This proves that we have no discernment concerning matters. Moreover, because of this, our work here cannot build up the church.</p>
<p>When we take care of the needy brothers and sisters, we must consider whether our care is for their building up or for their tearing down. This depends on our ability to discern things.</p>
