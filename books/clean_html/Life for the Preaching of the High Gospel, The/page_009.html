<P>Now when the young people ask me about whom they should marry, I answer, "I don't know. Only the Lord knows." I can only tell them that if they feel led of the Lord to marry that sister or that brother, then they should just go ahead and do it. I cannot say whether that brother or sister is good or not. I do not know. Only the Lord knows. Young brothers and sisters, you have to trust in the heavenly Father for your future, including your marriage. Only He knows. Your destiny is not in your hand; it is in His hand. Leave all things to Him. Just learn to say, "Hallelujah! I have a heavenly Father taking care of me in all ways."</P><P>Therefore, do not be deceived any longer by material things. Surely you need to study to get an education or learn a trade. But you should not be deceived by these things. We should not be preoccupied by these things. We do not seek these things first. We first seek the kingdom, the dominion, of God. We also seek to have His righteousness, to be right with Him, to be agreeable with Him. We desire to be perfect as He is perfect. We desire to bear His image and be under His authority all the time. We are not here to be moral, religious, or spiritual. We care only for one thing, that is, to be under His authority and to be agreeable with Him all the time.</P><P>We care only to be under God's authority. If God gives you the command to shout in the meeting, you should shout. If you say, "Oh, maybe it's not good to shout so loudly. I should take care of others," this is to be religious. I care only to be under the Lord's dominion. I care only to be right and agreeable with the Lord. We should not be deceived by religious things, which are even more deceiving than material and moral things.</P><P>Even the desire to be spiritual can be a kind of deceiving. This is why I feel compelled by the Lord to tell you these things. The Lord has no intention to gain a group of people who are "spiritual." Rather, His intention is to have a group of people who are under His authority, who are always right according to the Lord and agreeable with the Lord.</P><P>You can be like this only by taking Him as your person. Take Him not only as your life but also as your person. Then day by day you can declare to the whole universe, "It is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me" (Gal. 2:20a). Then you have the real righteousness. You are right and agreeable with the Lord, because you are Christ Himself. It is no more you, but it is Christ, so you have the righteousness under God's authority.</P><P>I have no intention to advise you to do this or not to do that. My burden is to help you realize that today the Lord is going to get a people, mainly of the young generation, who do not care for anything material, anything moral, anything religious, or anything spiritual. Of course, they also do not care for anything immoral, unreligious, or unspiritual. They care only for God's dominion and God's image. Brothers and sisters, the Lord is going to gain a people of the young generation who truly seek first God's kingdom and God's righteousness. Eventually, God will give them the material things, and they will be the most moral and spiritual people. But if you are just seeking after spirituality, you might be wrong. Today what you should seek after is not religion or spirituality. You need to seek the kingdom of God as well as His righteousness. We all need to be under His dominion and bear His image continually.</P><P>Matthew 5:3 says, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens." Then Matthew 5:10 says, "Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens." First, you need to be poor in your spirit. Do not consider that you know something or have something. You have to prostrate yourself, bow down, before the Lord, saying, "Lord, I have nothing and I know nothing. I don't like to retain or hold on to anything old in my spirit. I like to be poor in my spirit." If so, yours is the kingdom of the heavens.</P><P>You also have to be ready to suffer, to be persecuted, for the sake of righteousness, that is, for the sake of being right according to God, agreeable with God. If you want to be right according to God, you will be persecuted, because the whole world, which lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19) and is filled with unrighteousness, will rise up against you. In a sense, if you are seeking to be religious, many people will admire and welcome you. Also, in a sense, if you are seeking to be spiritual, many people will appreciate and speak well of you. But if you are seeking to be right with the Lord, to be right according to God, be prepared to be opposed and persecuted. But praise the Lord, the kingdom of the heavens is yours. You are in the kingdom of the heavens and are under God's dominion where you have the righteousness of God.</P><P>Today what the Lord is doing is to gain such a people as a preparation for His coming back to take over the earth. Then Revelation 11:15 will be fully fulfilled: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever." We will also reign with Him (2 Tim. 2:12).</P>
