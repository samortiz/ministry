In the church life we all must be general. However, before we can be general we must be special. Concerning the six items of our Christian faith, we must be very specific, very particular. If we are general about it, we are wrong, but this is just one side. We need balance.<h2 class=head1>THE GENERALITY PRACTICED BY PAUL</h2><p>As long as we have the solid foundation of the faith, the speciality, laid, we can be very, very general. The Apostle Paul was such a person. He was general to such an extent that, according to the record in Acts 21, when he went to Jerusalem the last time, he was persuaded to go to the temple again and even to keep some of the regulations of Judaism. In Romans and Galatians he boldly spoke against Judaism; yet, when he went to Jerusalem the last time, he was persuaded to go to the temple again.<p>Since Paul was a person who was faithful and strong, how could he take the advice to go back to Judaism and its priests, even paying the fee for four others? He was practicing generality. Of course, I will admit that on this occasion Paul went a little too far; even he was out of balance, so he made a mistake. Too much balance is still out of balance. He tolerated the situation, but this time the Lord did not. If Paul could have passed through those seven days without any trouble, that would have proved that what he did was right. But the Lord would not tolerate this in order to keep the truth of the gospel clear to the coming generations. However, this does show that Paul was a person who would be so general in the church life.<h2 class=head1>EATING THINGS SACRIFICED TO IDOLS</h2><p>According to Paul&#8217;s teaching, the New Testament teaching, should we as Christians eat the sacrifices offered to the idols, or should we not eat them? If you say, no, I would say that your answer is wrong. If you say, yes, I would also say that your answer is wrong. I have some verses that give me the ground to tell you yes (1 Cor. 8:4-8; 10:25-27), and I also have some verses that give me the ground to tell you no (1 Cor. 8:9-13; 10:28-29). In the New Testament there is no definite answer concerning this matter.<p>Not more than ten years ago did I get into the spirit of the writer of all these verses. Then I began to understand his meaning. It is not a matter of yes or no; it is a matter of generality. To say definitely that one should not eat anything offered to idols will cause problems. This will exclude several of the members. However, to say yes will also cause trouble. It will cause more damage. So Paul was general.<p>We all have to learn to be balanced. You may feel that you have the freedom to eat anything. You feel that idols mean nothing (1 Cor. 8:4-6), and every idol has been put under your feet. Even you can eat the things offered to the idol in front of the idol. But do you realize that your liberty and boldness will damage some weaker ones? They would never fellowship with you because they think you are associated with idols. Hence, on some occasions Paul would say that we should eat; and on the other occasions he would say that we should not eat. Both are right.<h2 class=head1>PRACTICING THE GENERALITY</h2><p>Suppose I am now fellowshipping, taking the Lord&#8217;s table, with a certain group of believers, and all of them are so strong in their conscience. They might say, &#8220;We do not care for idols; they mean nothing.&#8221; I will agree with them, &#8220;Yes, praise the Lord, eat! Eat the things sacrificed to the idols. It means nothing.&#8221; I say yes to them. But when I am with another group where the dear ones are weak in their conscience, afraid of being associated with anything of the idols, they might say that they do not have the freedom to eat the things offered to idols. I also will agree with them, &#8220;No, you should not do it.&#8221; Then you might rebuke me, saying that I am a person with two faces because you heard me say yes to one group and no to another group. We can never experience and practice this without a spirit of generality. Without such a spirit, we will surely cause division. It will not be possible for us to keep the oneness.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
