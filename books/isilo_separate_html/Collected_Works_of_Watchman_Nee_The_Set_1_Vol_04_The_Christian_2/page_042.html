Whenever the spiritual power is gone, God's judgment follows. The Lord leaves the church on earth as a testimony for the Lord Jesus. Hence, it is symbolized by the lampstand, something that shines in the moral darkness of the world. The church should testify of the Lord's past works, His present position, and His future glory. It is a golden lampstand. Therefore, it should have the nature of gold. If it does not testify of this or is not worthy of this testimony, it will be a false testimony, and the end is rejection by God. God can be patient. Thank Him that He was indeed patient. He can exhort the church to repent. Thank Him that He did exhort it to repent. However, no matter how great God's patience is, if the church does not repent, the end is sure. If God's exhortation falls on deaf ears, the lampstand will be removed, and the church will no longer be able to be God's light in the world. At any rate, the first position cannot be lost. Otherwise, God's glory and truth will suffer loss, and the ministry of the church as a testimony will be annulled. The safe place for a saint to be is one that abides close to Christ. If a church works faithfully at the beginning but loses its love later, it may still reject sin and corruption for a while, but it has already fallen into a dangerous position. The unique way of salvation is to repent and do the first works. Otherwise, although desolation may not appear right away, its coming is unavoidable. For the Lord to remove the church's lampstand does not mean that from now on it has no more outward activities or moves. It merely means that it can no longer be God's faithful testimony. Although the outward works may still go on, they are not what the Lord is after. Of course, He desires to have a true, pure, and faithful testimony, but what He is after is the heart of the church.</P><P>This is not only true with the church. It is also true with individual saints. God's intention is to perfect us. Those worldly and unfaithful believers should allow these words to deeply pierce their hearts. Since their walk is completely worldly, they are not able to speak to others concerning their Savior. They can say something, but what they speak will not have any power because the Holy Spirit will not work with them. Through their greed, selfishness, love for the world, and pursuit of fashion, they have lost their qualification to exercise their gifts. Their opportunity is gone, and there is no longer a reward reserved for them in heaven. On the day of the judgment, such people will not be able to stand before the Lord boldly and unabashed. When such a one stands before the judgment seat to give an account of what he has done in his body, he will suffer loss. Although he will be saved, his salvation will be as through fire. God has not called us to receive salvation only, but to testify for His Son. This is very important. However, the greatest goal of God in calling us is for us to be constituted with all the saved ones throughout the generations a bride for His Son. This should be the center of our thoughts. It should be the sweetest thought to us. His will is that we can be as the psalmist who said, "Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee" (Psa. 73:25). His greatest delight is the single-hearted love from His people as a response to His personal, sacrificial, and perfect love. His hope is that His people would take no other as their goal on earth except Himself, that they would maintain a virgin heart for Him, and that they would depart from the world and its customs. He is full of love towards us. At least, in the past, He has proved the sincerity and intensity of His love. But what is our response?</P><P>"Remove your lampstand out of its place." This only means that the position is lost and that one can no longer be a testimony for the Lord. This does not mean eternal perdition. All those who have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior will never perish. Once a person is saved, he is eternally saved, but what a pity it is that many are merely saved. Not only are they useless in the hands of the Lord, but they have grieved the Lord's heart through their coldness. How numerous are the churches today that have lost their nature and qualification as a lampstand! A church that has not recovered its first love for the Lord cannot be a true testimony for God. We must never forget our personal problem. What is the condition of the church we are in? Is it like Ephesus? God has many praises for Ephesus. Can He apply the same praises to our church? This will turn us to much self-examination. If a church has lost its first love and its testimony as a lampstand, in the eyes of the Lord it is no longer a church but has become a worldly organization and a society controlled by man's regulations. Man may consider it a great society, but what is God's valuation? The removal of a lampstand is something that is not seen by man's eyes, for it is something the Lord does in the heavenly tabernacle. According to the worldly view, there is no change between the time the lampstand is removed and the time when it was still there, but actually, before God, its position is lost. When the Lord Jesus forsook the temple in Jerusalem, He no longer called it His Father's house, but "your house," which was to be left desolate (Matt. 23:38). However, at that time, the white stones and the gold were still shining brightly there! Only a spiritual sight can detect the desolation behind the prosperity. Although the Lord did not say that He would blow out the lamp, when the lampstand is removed, the lamp will surely be darkened. Without the preservation of God's grace, a church will lose her testimony.</P><P>This first letter sets the tone for all seven letters. It is not written as a testimony to God's grace. It does not speak of God's love in caring, protecting, and comforting His saints. On the contrary, these seven epistles examine how the saints' walk matches the grace of their calling. Prior to this, God has shown forth His grace and love already. Everything that the saints need in life and work has been prepared. God is no longer declaring what He has declared. He is assuming that His people have received His grace and love already. For this reason, He requires of His people a life and walk worthy of their calling. Everything that comes short of this standard will be rebuked. The Lord searched their past works and spoke to them either words of praise or words of rebuke. The Lord also spoke of their future position, and their exaltation or humiliation will also be based on their future works. These seven epistles were not written with the purpose of preaching the Lord's grace but of judging the saints' conduct. It is true that our salvation is guaranteed and that there is no problem related to it. However, our position in the kingdom depends fully on the faithful work we do now in response to the constraining of the Lord's love.</P><P>After we have read these words, do not our hearts marvel? Before the apostle John passed away, is it not true that the church was still at its age of infancy and was at its prosperous period? However, the Lord condemned it and judged it as having fallen and rejected it! Actually, we have seen this in the New Testament already. Revelation is only a manifestation of the Lord's judgment. Paul's first Epistle was the Epistle to the Thessalonians. At that time, he already pointed out that "the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating" and that the apostasy will come (2 Thes. 2:7, 3). After this, he wrote 1 and 2 Corinthians. At that time, sin "that does not even occur among the Gentiles" had already appeared in the church (1 Cor. 5:1). First, there was the division and the sectarianism (1 Cor. 1:11-12; 3:3-4). Next, there was the denial of resurrection (1 Cor. 15:12). Finally, there were the Galatians who were "so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel" (Gal. 1:6). They had left the freedom in Christ and were again being bound by the enslaving yoke of the law. Then there were the Romans, to whom the apostle had to say, "Now I exhort you, brothers, to mark those who make divisions and causes of stumbling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them. For such men do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own stomach, and through smooth words and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple" (16:17-18). Further, we see Paul writing to the Philippians from the prison in Rome: "For all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" (2:21). They were "the enemies of the cross of Christ" (3:18). Finally, when he wrote to Timothy, he said, "At my first defense no one was with me to support me, but all abandoned me" (2 Tim. 4:16). Not only did those in Rome abandon him, but the whole of Asia as well. "All who are in Asia turned away from me" (1:15). Hence, all those who desire to be vessels of honor, sanctified, and useful to the master have to cleanse themselves from the dishonorable ones. The original text here refers to the people, that is, the sinners in "the great house," which is the church. In the last days, difficult times will come. Men will cloak themselves with Christ and hide their sins. They will have an outward form of godliness, but will deny the power thereof. These people will fall into a worse condition. Hence, we have to turn away from them. Now the leaven of sin has fermented the whole lump. God's saints have not been charged to change the whole lump but to "turn away" (2 Tim. 3:5; Rom. 16:17), to be "separated" (2 Cor. 6:17), to "cleanse [oneself] from these" (2 Tim. 2:21), and to "come out from their midst" (2 Cor. 6:17; Rev. 18:4).</P><P>If we read the Epistles of Peter, John, and Jude, what we find are but more degrading tragedies of the church. We see that the nominal church had become desolate. Its judgment had become inevitable. All those who truly served the Lord, who would not be defiled by uncleanness, and who did not agree with the worldly organization, had become the remnant of the Lord. The books before Revelation tell us that even the churches at the time of the apostles had become defeated. What the epistles in Revelation tell us now are nothing new. But whatever revelation was added merely tells us how judgment was executed on the failures. They lost their position and were disqualified to be the church of the Lord's testimony anymore. By the time we come to the end of these epistles, we will realize that there is no such thing as the whole church repenting. Hence, the words "remove your lampstand out of its place" still hold true! If it was already the last hour (1 John 2:18) at the time of the apostles, what about now? This is but an extension of the last hour!</P><P>Although this is the condition of the church, the Lord could not hold back His love. That is why after His sober warning, He came back to praising them. Our Lord always lingers on the merits of His people and is reluctant to gloss over them. Therefore He said:</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
