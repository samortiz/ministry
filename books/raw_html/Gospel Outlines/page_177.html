<h1 class="title">SEPARATED AND ALIENATED FROM GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Col. 1:21</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Separated from God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man was originally created by God; he belonged to God and lived before God.</li>
	<li>Due to his sin, man was separated from God. Not only is there a barrier between man and God, but there is also a distance between the two.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Alienated from God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Not only is man separated from God passively, but he is also alienated from Him actively. Separation from God is a forsaking of God, but alienation is a rebellion against God. Separation is a departure from God, but alienation is an assault upon God.</li>
	<li>The life of man today is not merely one that is separated from God, but it is one that is daily antagonistic toward God. Use examples to prove this.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to be reconciled to God
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are separated and alienated from God.</li>
	<li>Repent to God.</li>
	<li>Believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, as Savior.</li>
	</ol></li>
