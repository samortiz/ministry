   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING SEPARATED FROM THE WORLD AND IDOLS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fourth epistle is to Thyatira, in which fornication and idols are dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have something against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself a prophetess and teaches and leads My slaves astray to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices v. 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Spiritual fornication is the union of the church with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever the church is united to the world, that is a kind of spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church has nothing to do with the world and must be absolutely separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The world is the world, and the church is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are two realms, but Christianity has married them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is fornication in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church must have nothing to do with any worldly thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A local church must be so pure, so utterly separated from worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Worldliness is always related to idols.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we are united to the world, we spontaneously have idols.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The local churches should not have any kind of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An idol is simply a substitute of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything that replaces God and possesses man is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nothing should ever be allowed to replace God in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should never have anything that possesses us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our only Possessor must be God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our relationship must only be with God; otherwise, we will bring in fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The local churches must be so pure and separated from the world and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BEING LIVING RATHER THAN DEAD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the fifth epistle, the one to Sardis, the Lord did not rebuke the church for anything wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was nothing wrong, but she was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be dead is more serious than to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Allow me to illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose there is a little boy in this hall who is very naughty and wrong in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But there is also another boy in the hall who is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is nothing wrong with him, for he is adjusted and fully corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Which one would you prefer?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Would you like to contact the naughty boy or the dead one?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, we all would prefer the living one, even though he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord hates dead things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He told Sardis, I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Become watchful and establish the things which remain, which were about to die; for I have found none of your works completed before My God 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am afraid that in some of the churches, things are about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Their meeting is dead; their prayer is dying; everything is about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a dreadful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we only have a moral mentality to know what is right and what is wrong, this proves that we do not have the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is not a God of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is a God of the living.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A local church must be living, even if it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Of course, I do not encourage anyone to be wrong, but we must be living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Leviticus 11 tells us several times that whenever someone touches something which is dead, he is dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This dirtiness cannot be cleansed only by water.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A certain amount of time is also required for the cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, to be dirty with deadness is more serious than to be dirty with sinfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are some who come to the meetings in the local church who are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you touch them, you just touch deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I believe we all have had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must be careful with this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is not a living person but a dead one; therefore, we must flee from him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should run away not only from sinful things but especially from deadening things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes the things that come from the mouths of some people are just like a dead carcass.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Their talk is just like dead bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must not listen to this kind of talk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we do, we simply touch death.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then for one week, sometimes, we are not able to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sometimes we are even poisoned unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must not be another Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Every church must be living and alive.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must not try to be so right, but so living.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many, many times in the so-called Christian churches, people are religiously dead.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They are dead with religion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Many satanic things in so-called Christianity simply make people religiously dead.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When you come to the meeting and have a burden from the Lord to utter something, the religious death says that you should not say anything, but keep yourself quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is a kind of religious killing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I do not encourage you to be mad and to jump and dance.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I do not care for that.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But we must not be bound by any kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sometimes when we come to the meeting, we are so filled with the joy of the Lord that we have to shout, Hallelujah, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But simply due to the religious custom we received from our background, we will not shout because we think we should not.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is something religious that kills us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must not keep any religious customs.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Religion kills, and religion is something old.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Anything old will soon be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must not make our meetings religious.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We all must be very living, keeping ourselves open to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>HAVING BROTHERLY LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The sixth epistle is to Philadelphia, the name of which means brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the local churches we need the Philadelphia, we need the love for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We love one another because we love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need the brotherly love, for in this love we have the open door.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord said to Philadelphia, I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name Rev 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In a prevailing local church, the door is always wide open, because the brothers love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As long as the brothers and sisters love each other, the door can never be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The more we love one another, the more the doors will be opened.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we invite friends to come, it is unnecessary to preach to them; we simply let them see the love that we have with oneness and harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This alone will convince them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is no need for us to preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They are convinced already.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The way to open the door is to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The open door is set before Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we would have an open door, we must love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This will convince the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>BEING HOT RATHER THAN LUKEWARM</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Finally, we come to the last epistle, which is to Laodicea.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We all know what is mentioned in this epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The church was lukewarm, neither hot nor cold.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The Lord said to her, I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or hot.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of My mouth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Why was the church in Laodicea so lukewarm?</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is simply because she was too much in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If Christians are lukewarm, it is certain that they are too much in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>They have too many doctrines and too much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Romans 12:11 tells us the only way to keep from being lukewarm: Be burning in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We must forget about our mind and turn to the spirit and say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If we will say this for half an hour, we will be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Then we will never be lukewarm anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We must forget about the teachings and doctrines as well as our clear and clever mind.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We need to be burned in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In Sardis the Lord promised the overcomers the reward of white garments: He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments Rev 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>He says the same thing to the church in Laodicea: I counsel you to buy from Me...white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>What are these white garments?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>They are livingness.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>To be alive, to be living, is the white garments.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>If we are dead, we are dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>A dead person is the dirtiest one.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If we are dead, we are also naked.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We need some livingness to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Brothers and sisters, we all need the living garments.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The living garments are Christ Himself, wrought into us by the living Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The only way to have these garments is to turn ourselves to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Then we will be burned and really hot livingly hot.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>From these seven epistles I believe that we have seen what a local church in the Lord s recovery ought to be.</S>
