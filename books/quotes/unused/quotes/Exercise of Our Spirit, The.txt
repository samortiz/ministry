Paul wrote this Epistle during the era of the Greek Olympics, which included gymnastics, bodily exercise which is good for physical health
The apostle Paul used this word to say that we need another kind of gymnastics one that is related not to the physical body but to godliness
From our youth we received learning for the exercise of our mind through elementary junior high senior high college and even graduate school
In order to know what the exercise unto godliness is, we must first see what godliness is in the two Epistles to Timothy
For God to be manifested in the flesh in a living way, for Him to express Himself through us, requires that He live in us
We may say that the President is expressed in the newspapers but he is not expressed in a living way since there is no life in a photograph
Timothy 14 says Nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies which produce questionings rather than Gods economy which is in faith
Similarly, the precious stones on the shoulder plates and breastplate of the high priest were enclosed in settings of gold
The stones were built into the gold, and the gold was built with them; they and the gold were built up together as one
God is dispensing Himself into His many children so that He may build Himself into us and with us so that He and we would be one
Many Christians say that God saved us simply because He loved us and wanted to deliver us from hell and bring us to heaven
Since a person's closing word stresses the main point of his writing, Paul's central point in these Epistles must be related to our spirit
In incarnation God became Jesus, and through death and in resurrection and ascension He as Jesus was made Christ, the Lord
Rather God came into us as Christ who is God plus man with the human life and nature crucifixion for redemption resurrection and ascension
Timothy 1:7 says, 'God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
That person's will may be hard and stubborn, but it is not strong in a proper way unless it is subdued by and submissive to his spirit
A martyr is strong in his will because at the time of his martyrdom his will is completely submissive to his spirit
When our will is subdued by and submissive to our spirit, it becomes strong, and our spirit becomes a spirit of power
While He was on this earth, His will was submissive and He was obedient to the Father, so His spirit was strong
Toward Satan, the evil one, His spirit was strong, but toward the sinful ones His spirit was full of love and sympathy
Our will must be submissive, our emotion must be exercised to love others, and our mind must be sober, clear, and proper
We must love others soberly so that they will receive a benefit from our love; otherwise, they may be damaged and even deadened by our love
Our spirit is surrounded by our will, emotion, and mind; if these three parts are not adjusted and proper, we cannot have a proper spirit
Of course, we need to pray, but we must also be adjusted in our inward parts, the parts of our soul-the will, the emotion, and the mind
Timothy 1:5 says, 'The end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith'
Verse 19 says Holding faith and a good conscience concerning which some thrusting these away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith
If we do something wrong before God or man, we will have an evil conscience, a conscience with offense and condemnation
In order to serve God, we need a conscience that is both good and pure, a conscience from a heart that seeks after God alone
Because he cares more for the gospel work than for the Lord, the gospel is a substitute for the Lord in this brother's life and work
When we deal with our heart to make it pure and single, our heart causes our conscience to also be simple, single, and pure
Our spirit must be a spirit of a subdued and submissive will, of a properly exercised emotion, and of a clear, sound, and sober mind
It is only in the last few years that the Lord has revealed these things to us from the two Epistles of Timothy
We need to fellowship and pray concerning these matters, study all the foregoing verses, and be thoroughly impressed with them
The Lord refers to God plus many items, including incarnation, crucifixion for redemption, resurrection, and ascension
The first chapters of both 1 and 2 Timothy speak of the inward parts of our being in relation to the exercise of our spirit
Timothy 1:7 says, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
In saying this, Paul's intention was not merely to tell us something concerning the spirit; it was that we would use our spirit
In order to exercise the spirit we must have a subdued and submissive will, a proper emotion, and a clear and sober mind
If all these parts of the soul are under the control of the spirit, the spirit will be powerful, loving, and sober, and it will be released
When the parts of our soul are under the control of the spirit, they become a free course for the spirit to come out and be released
A spring of water may be pure and clean, but if it flows through sulfurous and salty passages, it will be mixed with sulfur and salt
Strictly speaking, the problems related to the exercise of our spirit are problems with either our will, our emotion, or our mind
According to the entire New Testament, God has reserved our spirit for Himself and has not allowed His enemy to come into it
If our will is submissive our emotion balanced and our mind clear and sober our spirit will be powerful loving sober and easily released
As we pointed out in the previous message, a brother may be very good; morally there may be nothing wrong with him
If we have condemnation, then regardless how much people encourage us to exercise our spirit, we will be unable to do it
If we deal with these inward parts, we will have a pure conscience in a pure heart with a pure will, pure emotion, and pure mind
We must have a spirit of power in our will, of love in our emotion, and of soberness and soundness in our mind
The two Epistles to Timothy speak in a particular way concerning praying and dealing with the word of God for the exercise of our spirit
Timothy 2:8 continues, 'I desire therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and reasoning'
In the following verses, however, he instructs that the women also should pray, but he adds some further requirements
For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been quite deceived, has fallen into transgression'
Timothy 2:22 says, 'Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart'
If a brother speaks to us out of the reasonings of his mind, we should not respond with an answer, argument, or suggestion
We need to exercise our spirit to apprehend the word, because the word is spiritual breath, the very breath of God
In the same way, the healthy teachings of the Bible are not firstly teachings for the mind but nourishment for the spirit
In the Epistles to Timothy and Titus, which are among the final writings of the apostle Paul, he stresses healthy words and healthy teaching
If we exercise our spirit, we may discern that the eloquent speaking and good illustrations are a worldly speaking without any life
Whenever we read the Bible, we should pray with what we read and understand, receiving God's word by means of all prayer
If we do this, we will receive not simply something for our mind but the healthy word for the nourishment of our spirit
We must learn to receive a healthy word, a word that is full of nourishment, not merely a sound or correct word
According to the medical doctors, the best way to have a long physical life is to exercise by walking and to eat properly
To exercise our spirit is to have fellowship with the Lord and also with the saints in the presence of the Lord
When we are in the fellowship either with the Lord directly or with the church or the saints, we are in the light
The more we exercise our spirit, the more we enter into fellowship, are under the light, and sense how much we need the blood to cleanse us
Whenever we have a feeling that we are sinful or wrong, our conscience is dirty and needs the blood to purify it
When God in heaven condemns, the conscience within us also condemns, and when God in heaven releases, our conscience also releases
Whenever we come to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, it is vital that we apply the blood to cleanse our conscience
We need the blood to bridge the gap between us and God so that we may come into His presence by exercising our spirit to contact Him
The living, divine anointing within us is the constant moving, working, inspiring, and enlightening of the indwelling Spirit of Christ
In order to exercise our spirit, we must not only apply the blood of Christ but also take care of this anointing
For the sake of the exercise of our spirit, we need to learn the lesson of rejecting our natural mind and caring for the anointing
We need to forsake our natural mind and care only for the moving and working of the anointing Spirit in our spirit
Thessalonians 51622 says Always rejoice unceasingly pray in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you
Similarly, to prove all things, to hold fast to what is good, and to abstain from every kind of evil also require that we pray
In order to exercise our spirit we need to practice until our spirit is strong enough that we have no fear before anyone or in any situation
Some of us today who once were in a smaller locality also may find it difficult to pray where there are many elderly and spiritual brothers
We need to practice and exercise so that regardless of the place, time, situation, or persons present we can always open ourselves to pray
Some may be afraid to pray unless they have the assurance that there will be many loud 'amens' to their prayer
We must all learn to practice the exercise of our spirit by opening ourselves to pray in any situation and in any kind of meeting
In addition, soul in the Bible refers to the soulish part of the human being and also to the soulish functions of man
Soul also refers to the soulish life of man, because the soulish part of man is the place where his human life is
Similarly John 1225 says He who loves his soullife loses it and he who hates his soullife in this world shall keep it unto eternal life
In various verses of the Bible soul denotes man himself, the soulish part of man, the soulish functions, and the soulish life
The physical body, which was made from the dust of the ground, is the outward organ to contact the physical, material world
The spirit, which came from the spiritual breath of life, is the inward organ to contact the Lord in the spiritual realm
At the time of the fall, Satan as sin came into man's body through man's eating of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Every kind of lust is in the body because the source of lust-Satan, the evil one-is in the body, that is, in the flesh
Because the soul came under the control of the flesh and was influenced by the flesh, the person of the soul became self-centered, the self
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men
Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it
In verse 23 the Lord rebuked Satan, but in verse 24 He did not tell the disciples to deny Satan; He told them to deny the self
Rather, man is very active in the body and soul, but the worldly people, the unbelievers, are deadened and dormant in their spirit
Although Satan took the physical body as his base to invade the soul, he was not able to enter into the spirit and take it over
Ephesians 2 tells us that Satan, the evil one, operated in the sons of disobedience, but it does not indicate that he invaded their spirit
When we believed in the Lord Jesus as our Savior and in His death for us, we were forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God
Before we were born again, we were only one man in the soul, but now we have two men, one in the soul and the other in the spirit
The first is the soulish man, the old man, the outer man, and the other is the spiritual man, the new man, the inner man
We must be clear that the soulish man cannot know or receive the things of God, but the spiritual man discerns them
Corinthians 4:16 says, 'Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day'
Formerly we were the soulish man, and we could live only by the life of this man because we did not have another life
Now our only problem is that although the Lord has crossed out all these negative items we may still treasure them and live by the old man
An organ does not have the right or ground to live or make a decision, but a person has every right and ground
Christ as the life-giving Spirit is mingled with our regenerated human spirit, and these two spirits are mingled as one
In Revelation 1 John saw the vision of the seven golden lampstands with the Son of Man standing in their midst
One who is spiritual is one who lives and walks by the Spirit of God, who indwells and is mingled with his regenerated spirit
All the preceding verses show that we, the regenerated ones, need to walk, live, do things, and have everything in the spirit
Of course, if we exercise our spirit, we may not become angry, but if we are angry, we must be able to say that we are angry in the spirit
Once the Lord Jesus became angry in the temple, driving out the moneychangers with a whip and overturning their tables
To live by the spirit is the mark of God's salvation; this has been missed by religion, but today the Lord is recovering this
We were all born in the soul, raised in the soul, and educated in the soul, and we have practiced to live in the soul continually
If we are not in the spirit, our contact with others is mere soulish or fleshly conversation, not spiritual fellowship
The Epistles also frequently tell us that we need to live, walk, do things, and pray continually in the spirit
It is not a matter of what we are doing; it is a matter of in what person we do it, in the soul or in the spirit
Medical experts tell us that if we covered our eyes for a number of months, we would lose our function of sight
In the same way, many brothers and sisters set their spirit aside and always use their mind, emotion, will, or simply their physical body
If we want to argue, we must first exercise our spirit to contact the Lord and consider our argument before Him
If we practice this, it will be easy to pray at any time and in any place, because our spirit will be strong, living, and active
If before we come to read the Bible we first prepare ourselves to exercise our spirit, we will see a difference in our reading
If we would silence our natural mind and enter into the spirit, we will receive light and revelation in spirit
A brother may not be clear concerning a certain matter, but if he would enter into the spirit, light and revelation will come
A husband may feel that he is right and his wife is wrong, and the more he argues, the more he feels he is right
If he would stop his arguing and reasoning and enter into the spirit, he will realize that he is wrong, and he will repent, even with tears
The more they argue, the more they remain in darkness, but if they would enter into the spirit, they will receive light
Rather, if we would enter into the spirit and remain in the spirit for a certain time, everything will be clear
When we are outside of the spirit, we may do many things foolishly, but if we are in the spirit, we will do things with wisdom
