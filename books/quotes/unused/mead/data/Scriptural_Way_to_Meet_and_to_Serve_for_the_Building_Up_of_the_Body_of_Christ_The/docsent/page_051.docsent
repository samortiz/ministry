   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When a baby is born, he first exercises his body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a period of time, the child learns to exercise his mind and to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Eventually he is able to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the exercise of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Athletics helps people to exercise their body, and schools help people to develop the exercise of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Philosophy and psychology are a product of the exercise of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Today every school stresses the exercise of the body and the exercise of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The athletic grounds are for bodily exercise and the classrooms are for the exercise of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is nothing for the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The exercise of the spirit cannot even be found in the Jewish religion or in most of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No school or religion covers this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the Bible, the development of the spirit is greatly stressed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Second Timothy 1:7 says, For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our spirit is related to the three organs of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our soul we have the will, the emotion, and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The spirit of power relates to the will, the spirit of love relates to the emotion, and the spirit of a sober mind relates, of course, to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All family, social, and national problems are due to the fact that people use their mind, emotion, and will but not their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They think with their mind apart from their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They love and hate with their emotion without touching their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They make decisions, not exercising their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is as if they do not have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jude 19 says, These are those who make separations, soulish, not having spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, they do have a spirit, but it is dead, dormant, and altogether neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They only exercise a strong will, unruled emotions, and an unbalanced, biased, and reprobate mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such ones are able to do many evil things related to their own person and to their family, society, and nation, for they have no relationship with their human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible tells us that in God s salvation the first and central matter is for God to touch our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is to be regenerated in our spirit with the Spirit John 3:5-6 , to have our dead and dormant spirit enlivened by the Spirit Eph 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first word of the New Testament gospel is repent Matt 3:2; 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Repentance is related to the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If our conscience has never been touched and enlightened, we could never repent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Repentance comes from the touching and enlightening of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When our conscience is enlightened through the preaching of the gospel, repentance issues forth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we repent with the confession of our sins before God, the more our conscience is enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The conscience is the greatest part of our spirit Rom 9:1; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our human experience, the conscience nearly equals the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before we were saved, we committed sins quite often.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a young boy, when I participated in wrongdoing, there was something in my conscience condemning me and telling me clearly that I should not be doing that.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even though there was no one to catch me, there was a deep fear within me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That was the function of the conscience created by God in my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 2:15 says of the nations, Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing joint witness, and their reasonings accusing or else excusing one another.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even when we were unsaved and our spirit was dormant and deadened, there was the conscience telling us what was right and wrong, and either justifying us or condemning us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we heard the gospel and repented, the first part of our being which we used was our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our conscience, that is, our spirit, was opened to the regenerating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we confessed and called on the name of the Lord, the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, entered into our spirit to enliven it and to dwell in it, to unite and mingle Himself with our spirit to form a mingled entity composed of the divine God and a human man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From the time of our repentance, we the regenerated people should walk, live, and have our being absolutely according to this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should exercise the spirit given to us by God in prayer Eph 6:18 , in speaking Acts 6:10 , in daily walk Rom 8:4 , and in function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whenever we pray, our prayer usually begins with the exercise of the mind rather than of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, after a few sentences, our prayer will spontaneously turn from our mind to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is because our spirit, not our mind, is our praying organ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A baby begins to move by crawling on his hands and knees, but because his feet with his legs are the walking organ, his crawling eventually leads to standing and walking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our prayer by our mind leads us to prayer by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Moreover, we now know the secret to praying in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not need to start praying by our mind, but we can begin by calling on the name of the Lord O Lord Jesus; Lord, I worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this way we can immediately begin our prayer by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the foregoing fourteen chapters, we have pointed out that the proper Christian experience is to have everything related to us linked with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have also seen that the Triune God is of the riches of Christ, and these riches can become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The major items of this enjoyment regeneration, being filled within with the essential Spirit, and being filled without with the economical Spirit are normal yet miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The way to have all these normal yet miraculous things is by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The development of the exercise of our spirit is practiced mainly in the proper church life that is based upon the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is not much exercise of the spirit in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although a few small groups of Christians have been helped in relation to this matter, it is hard to find some who take care of the exercise of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thank the Lord that this is stressed very much among us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Even as an elderly person, I exercise my body because I still have to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I render much service to my body that it may serve me better.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If I do not walk at least half an hour daily, I may become sick.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I also exercise my soul very much.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I use dictionaries, lexicons, and concordances quite often in order to develop my understanding, my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Most of all, I daily exercise my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Often I hear good news.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Good news always encourages people, making them proud of their accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The way to avoid this kind of corruption is to not stay in the mind to consider how much you are appreciated.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The more we exercise our mind in this way, the more we will be corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we hear good, encouraging news, we must turn to our spirit and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Many times, however, I may hear bad news, news which is damaging, discouraging, and depressing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>On hearing this kind of news, one may be depressed and discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The only way to stay away from this negative influence is to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On calm days when I have neither good nor bad news, I still like to exercise my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have to pray and get my spirit strengthened, trained, and disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I have to exercise my spirit to pray my entire being into the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If I lived in a common way all day long and came to speak in the meeting, I would not have the heavenly light and I could not speak such terms as the miraculous normality.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>All the fresh, new terms I have used in these messages came from much labor in exercising my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is what you also need to do.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am not teaching you athletics for the exercise of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Neither am I teaching you as a professor to understand many things.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What I am doing here is uniquely to help you to develop your spirit, to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After a short time with this ministry, many have been helped to exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>To pray-read two verses and call on the name of the Lord early in the morning, to speak the Lord all the day long, and to walk strictly according to the spirit is for the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we do not have such an exercise, our spirit will be weak, and we will be through with the Lord s move.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then our meetings will be dead and full of vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>To keep our meetings fully in the spirit, we need to exercise our spirit.</S>
