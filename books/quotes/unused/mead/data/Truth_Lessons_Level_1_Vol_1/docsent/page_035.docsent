   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ABEL IS SEEN GOD S WAY OF REDEMPTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>ACCEPTANCE BY GOD THROUGH THE SACRIFICE A. Abel Working and Living for God</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>a Feeder of Sheep</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Abel worked and lived for God; he also lived by God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was a feeder of sheep for God Gen 4:2, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>During Abel s time sheep were not to be eaten by men, because before the flood men were allowed to feed upon vegetables and fruits only Gen 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, Abel s feeding the sheep was not to seek food for his own existence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He did not work and live for himself as Cain did, but for God s satisfaction as God desired.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It seems that the purpose and interest of his life was to satisfy God in God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>B. Abel Worshipping God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>according to God s Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Abel did not present his sacrifice according to his concept, thought, or way, but according to God s way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He worshipped God according to His revelation Heb 11:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He knew that he had been born of fallen parents and that he was evil, sinful, and polluted in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He needed an offering with the shedding of blood to satisfy God s righteous requirement and the skins of the sacrifice to cover the naked man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, the Bible says that Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof Gen 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he offered the fat, the sacrifice was killed and the blood was shed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The shedding of the blood was for his redemption, and the burning of the fat was for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did this according to the instruction of his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What Abel did corresponded exactly to the requirements of the Mosaic law which was given later by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This proves that his way of worshipping God was according to God s revelation, not according to his concept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Numbers 18:17, the firstling of a cow or sheep, a type of Christ, could not be eaten by the Israelites; it had to be offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, in typology Abel offered Christ to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The offering of the firstling of a cow or sheep had two factors: the blood, which was sprinkled on the altar for redemption, and the fat, which was burned on the altar as an offering, as a sweet savor unto the Lord for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus Christ had these two factors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He had the blood which was shed for us and the fat which satisfied God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abel, seeing God s way of redemption, presented such an offering to God and was accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>IN ENOSH IS SEEN MAN S NEED FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>AND MAN S CALLING UPON HIM</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>TO ENJOY GOD S RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Enosh means frail, mortal man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the fall, not only did human life become a vanity, but man also became frail and mortal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we see that our life is vanity and that we ourselves are frail, spontaneously we will call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the reason that Genesis 4:26 says, Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the time of Enosh, the third generation of mankind, men began to call upon the name of the Lord, realizing their weakness, fragility, and mortality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Hebrew, the word for the Lord is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The name Jehovah begins to appear from Genesis chapter two; it is primarily used for God in relation to man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jehovah is the name for God coming into an intimate relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, Genesis 4:26 does not say that men began to call on the name of God, but on the name of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Men did not call on the One who created all things, but on the One who was so near to them, on the One who was closely related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The name Jehovah means I AM THAT I AM Exo 3:14 ; He is the One existing from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He is the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who will be in the future forever.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When men realized that they were fragile and mortal, they began to call on Jehovah, the eternal One.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This calling began even with the third human generation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It continues throughout the Bible, and it was also practiced by the New Testament saints Acts 9:14; 22:16; 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
