God's purpose is that Christ would mingle Himself with us to be our life and nature, that the two-Christ and we-would become one
We may say that everyone who is truly saved is two yet one-having two lives, two natures, and two personalities
If we allow our inward person to have a free way in us, that is, if we allow God to gain the victory, then God will be expressed through us
The crucial question is whether it is God who has the ground to rule and direct in us or we who rule and direct ourselves
Herein lie our victory, our holiness, our experience of all spiritual realities, and even our growth in life in the Lord
The problem lies in our natural self, which needs to be broken, to pass through death, and to be dealt with by death
The Lord Jesus said, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
We are unable to multiply, unable to bear much fruit, and unable to produce many grains because we have not been broken through death
A change in outward behavior means that in the past you did whatever you liked, acting loosely and without any restraint
Now, since you have been saved, you feel that your former conduct would not befit a Christian and therefore you need to be more cautious
Christianity today exhorts people to improve their outward behavior, but what God pays attention to is far higher than this
God is not after a mere change in man's outward behavior; rather, He desires man to have an inward transformation in life
God requires that we be broken and crushed so that the Christ within usthe glorious Christ the Christ of holinessmay be lived out through us
From the human perspective, Christians of this kind do not look like Christians at all because they live and walk just like the unbelievers
What God desires is not just that we would be delivered from sins but that Christ would be lived out from within us
When the Lord Jesus was incarnated, He was restricted, constrained, and unable to be released from His human body
The shell of His human body was broken through death so that the divinity within Him, the Christ within Him, could be released
Many people observe Christmas to celebrate the birth of Jesus, but they have never experienced the birth of Jesus
When the Lord suffered the blow of the cross, His being was broken and split apart, and the life was released from within Him
It would be relatively easy for such a one to become humble because he may often examine himself and condemn his irritability
What she means is that her husband is quick but she is not and that she is meek but her husband is troublesome
When they hear a word concerning breaking, they think, 'Brother Chang is quick-tempered, so he surely needs to be broken
A certain sister may have believed in the Lord for over a decade, yet because her life has been easy and smooth, she has no wounds at all
She got married to a husband who is considerate, she gave birth to a son who is obedient, and she found a job that is easy and smooth
Many times the work that God carries out in someone who is truly in His hand is the work of breaking, smiting, and splitting
Jesus the Nazarene, the One who was the most acceptable to God, also experienced many sufferings while He was on the earth
A person who is in God's hand, if he is highly regarded or esteemed by God, will have many wounds as the result of God's work in him
The Lord's purpose was that Paul might experience His sufficient grace and realize that he needed to be broken
He who has the breaking of the cross has the outlet of life, and he who has wounds has the outflow of the Lord's life
In Malaysia all the rubber tree farmers know that the only way the latex can flow out from a rubber tree is if it is cut open
We see that the problem that God's life in us faces is not the world, sins, or human relationships but our natural man
We assume that as long as we have thoroughly dealt with sins and are absolutely delivered from the world, then we are good Christians
You may say that the water is stopped because the bottle is too dirty, but after you wash the bottle, the water still cannot flow out
In the same way, even though you may have gotten rid of the filthiness and the worldly flavor in you, life still cannot flow out through you
When we were first saved, we thought that if we could deal with our sins and the world and do good deeds, we would be good Christians
They do not make any progress in their spiritual condition, and the Lord still does not have a way out through them
Christ will have a way out only when our being, our self, has passed through the breaking and the dealing of the cross
The Bible shows us that when the Lord was hanged on the cross, He was crucified with the human body which He had put on
May God have mercy on us to show us not only that Christ is our life but also that we have already been crucified with Him
God gathered the Romans, the Jews, and the Greeks, and He crucified the Lord Jesus through those who were against God
After we have seen the fact of the cross, we have to be prepared, because God's hand will come in to do the breaking and smiting work in us
The day will come-perhaps today, tomorrow, in a year, or in ten years-when we will be willing to receive the breaking of the cross
Such a one, just as Paul said, does not know anything among the saints except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified
Philippians 1:20b-21a states, 'Even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death
Verse 19 of chapter three says, 'And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God'
Among these Christians it is hard to find one who can meet God's standard and who really knows the purpose ordained by God in eternity
We have to always bear in mind that God does not desire anything else; He desires only to mingle Himself with man
God's purpose is to arrive at the stage where the human element is within Him and the divine element is within man
Because He is in us, His personality becomes our personality, His nature becomes our nature, and His life becomes our life
His image is our image, His glory is our glory, His holiness is our holiness, and His goodness is our goodness
The day will come when we will see that all those who serve God are exactly the same as the God whom they serve
He wants to mingle with us to the extent that it is hard to say whether He is God or a man or whether we are men or God
God's nature becomes man's nature, and God and man, having become one and mingled together, cannot be separated
One day, however, God will show us that Christ is God becoming flesh, God manifested in the flesh, and God mingled with man
Once we see this vision, we will say with exultation, 'The Lord in whom we believe is said to be God, and He truly is God
Formerly you were irritable and unforgiving, but now you yield to others in everything and are willing to be wronged
Being a Christian, however, is not a matter of cultivating oneself in order to eliminate the 'sour taste' in one's life
When you ask them about Revelation, they tell you that it is about the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls
We have heard many doctrines, we are zealous, and we also love the Lord, but Christ's element has not increased much in us inwardly
It is because we only have a small amount of Christ in us, and Christ has not grown in us or been formed within us
Do not think that the church is progressing simply if it increases in number from several hundred to three or five thousand
The growth of the church hinges not on an increase in number, in love, or in zeal but on the increase of the element of Christ
Our eyes must be opened so that in our spirit we may see the light the revelation and the vision that Christ wants to mingle Himself with us
We really cannot convey this with words; hence, we need to petition, pray, and look to the Lord for the light and revelation
We should have the realization that our pursuing and our spirituality all depend on Christ's being mingled with us
Now we all are clear that the purpose of reading the Bible is not to gain some biblical knowledge but to allow Christ to increase in us
Such a person always thinks that others are wrong and at fault because his mind is filled with doctrines in letter and he is short of Christ
Many people allow Christ to add Himself to them in a continual way through their reading of the Bible, the divine word
If we read the Bible in this way, the Lord will touch our inner being and even deeply touch our opinions and concepts
From now on, however, when we read the Bible, the Lord may touch our inner being with just one sentence or one verse
The same matter may be of two different sources; it may be out of ourselves, or it may be carried out through Christ
Sometimes when we love someone, we are murmuring within, asking why we love this person so much even though this person does not love others
When you have the feeling that you love people, yet others do not love people, this kind of love is, no doubt, from yourself
Because of this seeing, we will not allow our evil self to replace Christ, nor will we allow our good self to replace Christ
If we really have the light, we will see that many things in us are enemies of Christ and that many matters in us are substitutes of Christ
May God have mercy on us by removing these substitutes and frustrations from us so that Christ may increase and grow in us
Eventually, Christ will be mingled with us to such an extent that we and He, He and we, will be completely one
He was eager to die because there was a powerful unlimited and eternal life concealed in Him and He strongly wished that He could release it
In the Scriptures, however, eternal means 'infinite,' not only with respect to time but also with respect to space
Not only so, when you are in Taipei, you cannot be in Tainan, and when you are at home, you cannot be in the meeting hall
When He was in Galilee, He could not be in Judea; when He was in Peter's home, He could not be in James's home
The death of the cross causes the human shell to be split and broken so that the unlimited life can be released from man
He was very much restricted in the human flesh; therefore, He longed to go to the cross that He might be broken
In John 12:24 the Lord Jesus said, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone'
The Lord Jesus said that once the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it begins to grow and bear much fruit
If you ask a genuine Christian why Jesus died, he will reply that Jesus died to bear the sin of the world and become a curse for the world
When He was on the cross, a soldier pierced His side with a spear, and immediately there came out blood and water
If He, the one grain of wheat, was to be multiplied thirtyfold, sixtyfold, or a hundredfold, He had to pass through death
After the Lords death His life was released from within Him and after His resurrection this life entered into all those who believed in Him
After His resurrection He intentionally appeared to the disciples to show them that He was no longer limited by time or space
When Jesus the Nazarene was in Galilee, He could not be in the land of Judea; when He was in the land of Judea, He could not be in Galilee
At that time Roman politics, Greek philosophy, and Jewish religion had no way to deal with Peter and the apostles
After the Lord's resurrection they brought three thousand people to be saved on one day , and five thousand on another day
All Bible readers know that the four Gospels are the biographies of Jesus, and Acts is the biography of the disciples
The four Gospels are the biographies of Jesus as an individual, while Acts is the biography of Jesus in the disciples
The reason the Lord Jesus had to die and be raised was so that He could enter into man to be man's life for His spread and extension
Christianity has missed a great and precious point-God's life enters into man at the time he believes in Jesus
Once the lamp is connected to the electric source, the electricity will immediately enter into the electric lamp to make it shine
Do not think that if you 'polish' yourself outwardly, that is, if you improve your behavior, you will be saved
If we think that to believe in Jesus is merely for us to obtain peace, joy, and blessing, then we only know the appearance of the treasure
You have no need to consult people outwardly, because there is One in you who is very wonderful, and you can come near to Him
When you are sad and sorrowful, and no one sympathizes with you, this One in you, as a voice or a thought, will comfort and cherish you
When you are about to lose your temper or to commit a sin, this One will urge you not to do so and will stop you from doing so
Because you are a person who is subjective-that is, you have a mind, emotion, and will-you must make the choice by yourself
In 2 Corinthians 4711 he said But we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us
For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh
We must look to God to show us what Christ and the cross will accomplish in us and how we can know Christ and the cross
How can His life swallow up all of our natural being, fill our inner being, become our element, and be expressed through us?
If a person is not dead or finished, it will be extremely difficult for him to be delivered from sins and the world
We think that as long as we are able to deal with our temper and improve our behavior, we can satisfy God's heart
God's salvation, however, is to bring man to zero, to bring man to an end, and to terminate man through the cross
Those who do not know God's salvation like to exhort people to reject evil, to turn to good, and to improve their behavior
Does one who is hanging on the cross, dying on the cross, still need to improve himself or reject evil and turn to good?
One day he said, 'It is definitely good to live out God's love, but to live out man's love is better than to live out man's hatred'
Gods love cannot be expressed in someone who lives in his hatred likewise Gods love cannot be expressed in someone who lives in his own love
Regardless of whether a person is irritable or meek, once he is dead, there will be no more irritability or meekness
If we bury a seed in the soil, this will offer the seed an opportunity to grow out of death, because there is life in the seed
Some people claim that they know the cross, that they are already on the cross, and that they are already finished and terminated
They think in their own way, they look at people according to their own view, and they deal with matters according to their own judgment
When there is the work of death within us, there will be resurrection, and the Spirit of Christ will be expressed
We should not take what is outwardly right or wrong, good or evil, as the standard; rather, we should take the inward Christ as the standard
He will do this to the extent that we will not even need to think, but Christ in us will give us the clear feeling to know what is of Him
What God desires today is that many people will see from the light of the cross that they have been terminated by the cross
When we have such an experience, we will see that Christ is our life and that we are in the death of the cross and on the path of the cross
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men
Jesus said to His disciples, If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me
For whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it'
We tend to think that if we do something right, we are pleasing God, and if we do something good, we are in His shining
In Gods view however only that which is of Christ is acceptable whatever is of ourselves whether good or bad is utterly rejected by God
Since man is a living being, having his own preference, thinking, emotion, will, and choice, how can he not live out himself?
Not only is it difficult to stop ourselves in big matters, it is even more difficult to stop ourselves in small matters
Sometimes while we are enjoying reading the Word, we may get an inward feeling that we should spend a little time to pray for the church
According to spiritual principles, once we have such a feeling, we should immediately stop reading and pray instead
It is one thing to have the willingness to fellowship with others, but it is another thing to have the feeling to go and visit the saints
Because we are too willing to fellowship, we are unable to stop, and because we are enjoying the fellowship, we would not visit the saints
When it is we who love others, the Holy Spirit will give us a feeling that this love is out of our natural man and is actually ourselves
If we love others by ourselves, people will be able to touch our love and ourselves, but they will not be able to touch Christ
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
The Lord Jesus said, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
The Lord first bore the cross and then was crucified, but with us, we first are crucified, and then we bear the cross
When someone praises us, we should not be too excited, because later he may be the one who attacks us the most
If a person has not been dealt with, he may do good things now, but that does not necessarily mean that he will not do bad things later
He requires us to be delivered not only from evil and from good, but He also requires us to be delivered from our self
Only those who have passed through the cross will be able to stand the tests, the blows, and the various trials and afflictions
Someone may be stumbled and may stop coming to the meetings because he was told by an usher to sit in the front row
Another one who was zealous in preaching the gospel may suddenly stop preaching because others looked at him with cold eyes
The fact that we can sense whether people welcome us or not proves that the cross has never done the breaking work in us
If we simply love the Lord, we will have the light to see that all that comes out of ourself has already been put on the cross
There is hardly anyone who always chooses the cross, who never rejects the cross, and who always acknowledges the cross
If we love the Lord and are willing to take the cross, the Lord will use the outward environment to see if we will truly take up the cross
Sometimes, because of our reluctance in taking the cross, God will use the environment to smite us and break us
If we know the cross, we will welcome humiliation more than glory, difficulty more than ease, and adversity more than prosperity
If we know the cross, we will say that we only deserve to stay on the cross, be ended by the cross, and be terminated by the cross
If the Lord is merciful and gracious to us, many of our problems will be eliminated, and much of the friction will disappear
The church should be one, but without the breaking and dealing of the self through the cross, it is difficult to have this oneness
Although the words are simple, what is spoken of here is very mysterious, and what is included here is extremely rich
We should not only pay attention to the fact that we may be filled, but also to the fact that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God
Even though the church in Ephesus was already very high and spiritual, God still had His highest desire and purpose for them
From this we see how much God's desire for His children is neglected and how hard it is for man to reach God's desire
In other words, unless we allow the Holy Spirit to work in us, the riches of God cannot possibly become our inward element
When the Spirit works in us, Christ makes His home in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God
Very few people can say, 'We believe that Christ is making His home in our hearts and that God in Christ indwells us through the Spirit'
If we do not believe that God dwells in us, we will have nothing to say because we will have no basis for our speaking
When we lose our job, we ask God to give us a job, and when we get a job, we are full of praise and thanksgiving to God
We may have praised God innumerable times, but have we ever praised God concerning the indwelling of the God of glory?
In the Gospel of Matthew, the Lord told us that if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, all that we need will be added to us
You did not buy the calendar, but because you bought the fabric, the storeowner gives you a calendar as something added to you
The Lord said that if we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, what we would eat, drink, and be clothed with will all be added to us
Even though sometimes He puts us through trials, we still have to properly praise and thank Him for our relationship with Him
Today many Christians do not know the God who created all things; rather, they treasure all the things that He created
Indeed, a Christian should have this kind of experience, but this cannot be counted as a real spiritual experience
If we do not release such messages, the God of glory in us will not be pleased, because this is His intention revealed in the Scriptures
He is not only our Lord, our Father, and our God; He is also living in us, and we are being filled unto all His fullness
After this he did not care that the distribution of his family's inheritance was taking place; he simply gave up everything
At the Lord's table our heart should be touched by His grace to praise Him that He lives in us and is united with us
It is not enough to see only the Lord's love in dying for us; we should also see the purpose of His love in dying for us
The outermost part is the body, the innermost part is the spirit, and in between the spirit and the body is the soul
The Bible tells us, however, that man not only has two parts-body and soul-but that man also has a spirit deep within him
Even though we have material enjoyment and are not lacking psychological entertainment, inwardly we still feel unhappy
Although many people are saved and have God in their spirit, they do not have God's element in their mind, emotion, and will
Some zealous Christians may be moved when they kneel down to pray and touch God but after they rise up they are the same as they were before
Their thoughts are still their thoughts, their will is still their will, and their emotion is still their emotion
Such a one is genuinely saved and God truly dwells in his spirit, but God is surrounded by his soul and is not able to move
The lampshade may be likened to our body, the lightbulb to our soul, and the filament to our spirit in which God dwells
How do we become those whose thoughts, emotions, decisions, likes, and inclinations all have God's flavor, those who have God within us?
Our biological heart can be seen during a surgical operation, but no one has ever seen our psychological heart
According to the thought in God's Word, the heart includes one part of the spirit and all the parts of the soul
When the Bible speaks of man's relationship with God, it says that we must use our spirit to worship and contact God
Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you'
At this time the Spirit also transfuses God's mind into our mind, God's emotion into our emotion, and God's will into our will
God will mingle Himself with us to the extent that all of our attitudes, speaking, expression, and actions will express God
The people we pray for are the people God will work on, and the degree to which we pray is the degree to which God will work
These watchmen who were appointed by God reminded Him day and night, giving Him no rest and taking no rest for themselves
He wants to save thousands of sinners and has been ready to save them for a long time, but He has not found anyone to work together with Him
According to the laws of electricity two wires are required to transmit electricity-the supply wire and the return wire
If there is a supply wire but no return wire or a return wire but no supply wire, electricity cannot be transmitted
Nonetheless, they have discovered this fact that there must be return and supply wires for electricity to be transmitted
The Spirit of God cannot be transmitted to the earth because a 'return wire' is lacking-men on the earth who will cooperate with Him
All the heavenly blessings, power, grace, and even God Himself will be transmitted to the earth through that person
In words we can understand God tells us that if we do not work together with Him if we do not pray and if we do not remind Him He will rest
Those who have been saved are very few in number, the gospel has not been widely spread, and many places still do not have churches
The 'supply wire' is already there, but there is no 'return wire' yet; therefore, there is no electricity or light in this place
Today the salvation of God seems to be powerless, and the gospel does not seem to be the power of God because very few are being saved
If we do not care for God, look to God, work together with God, pray to God, or remind God, He will be unable to do anything
If He cannot find a man and if there is no one who will work with Him, He will have no way to do His work on earth
If we have the desire to answer God's call, from now on we should resolve to set aside some time to pray before the Lord every day
For three and a half years our Lord Jesus was on the earth with the disciples every day, leading and teaching them
Although we cannot find such a word in the Gospels, we can draw the conclusion that the Lord was touching their hearts
The Lord touched James's heart, Peter's heart, and Andrew's heart; He touched the hearts of all twelve disciples
On the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit descended, there were a hundred and twenty people whose hearts were ready and were for the Lord
After the Lord's death the brothers, such as Peter, were still weak, even though they knew that the Lord had resurrected
After Peter heard that voice, he disregarded everything, forsaking the boat and the fish, and threw himself into the sea
The Lord did not rebuke him; rather, He asked Peter gently and sympathetically, 'Do you love Me more than these'?
The sole emphasis and purpose of the Lords work in those three and a half years was to touch the disciples hearts and lead them to love Him
The Lord brought Peter, James, John, and the rest of the disciples to a point where they were touched by His love and saw His glory
They did not seek after the things of the earth but only after the things of the heavens; they cared not for man but for God alone
Without these one hundred and twenty people loving the Lord and emptying the world from their hearts, God would have had no way to work
The world had no place in them, the world could not usurp them, the world had no power over them, and the world had been emptied out of them
These people not only loved God, but they were emptied of the world, and they turned their entire being away from the earth completely
Their hearts were turned to such an extent that one day they simply gave up everything-the earth, the sea, the boat, the net, and the fish
When they went up to the upper room in Jerusalem, their whole being and all of their hearts were turned toward the Lord
May the Lord draw us that we may love Him and be touched by Him, so that our heart may be turned right-side up toward the heavens
From this day on, we need to pray and ask the Lord to turn all our hearts around so that we who belong to God would be those who love God
In the Gospels the Lord paid attention to the matter of our heart, but in Acts and the Epistles, the Lord touches the matter of our spirit
Our understanding of spiritual matters and things will be very superficial and limited, and we will not be deeply rooted spiritually
Perhaps others do not know how to preach the gospel, so they ask the Lord for the gift of preaching the gospel
Some among us should rise up and ask for gifts that are easier to obtain: the gifts of healing and casting out of demons
We look to the Lord that He would raise up many saints to answer His calling for the work of spreading the gospel
May we all see that there is no other place and no other age that needs the gospel more than this place and age in which we are now
We thank the Lord that He has given us a stable society and environment that are convenient for the preaching of the gospel
Verse 24 continues, 'But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God'
In addition, even those who are in Christianity have different understandings and have made many comments concerning the church
We desire to come back to God and to His Word in order to see what the church really is and what the reality of the church really is
Man's understanding of the church is altogether the understanding of an unlearned person, and it is altogether apart from God's Word
To accomplish what God intended to accomplish and to do what God intended to do, Christ was God Himself in man
Even if there were no other Christians in Taipei except a few of us, when we were added together, we would still be the church in Taipei
A person who belongs to Christ is called a Christman and when a group of people who belong to Christ are added together they are the church
Please remember that God was in Jesus the Nazarene, whose name was Christ, and that this Christ has entered into many people
Within these people, all of their personality, disposition, thoughts, interests, desires, feelings, and contents are just Christ Himself
Paul said that we who serve God do not preach the Jewish religion or Greek philosophy-we do not preach signs or wisdom-but we preach Christ
Such ones do not know Genesis, nor are they clear about Revelation, but they have received Christ inwardly and have contacted Christ
When you contact them you sense a sweet and glorious flavor because what you touch is neither Christianity nor doctrines but a living Christ
Now we have to see how we who are saved can know more of Christ, be filled more with Christ, and have more experiences of Christ
Another is the Mary of Bethany, who was a sister of Lazarus and who anointed the Lord Jesus with fragrant ointment
These three different Mary's loved the Lord in three aspects- in His birth, in His death, and in His resurrection
Those who experience the Lord also experience Him in these three aspects: in His birth, in His death, and in His resurrection
The Lord's birth was through a Mary; before the Lord's death, there was a Mary; and after the Lord's resurrection, there was also a Mary
We must experience Christ's coming into us; second, we must experience Christ's death; and third, we must experience Christ's resurrection
Paul said, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
We can easily understand Christ's being in us, but we may not understand that much about Christ's resurrection
The birth of Christ needed a Mary, the death of Christ needed a Mary, and the resurrection of Christ also needed a Mary
If a person wants to allow Christ to be born in him and if he wants to experience Christs death and resurrection this person must be a Mary
The angel answered and said to her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you'
Today our big problem is that even though we preach Christ, very few of us are willing to sacrifice our own status
If a boss is willing to not act like a boss due to his love for the Lord, this is to sacrifice his status as a boss
Some Christians are very spiritual, but the problem we find in them is that they want to maintain their status
As human beings, we should keep our status; however, as lovers of the Lord, we should overflow life and release Christ
If for the Lord's sake, the richer saints in the church fellowship with the poorer saints, what a beautiful scene this will be!
Romans 6:3-5 says, 'Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?
For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection'
Verse 26 says, 'For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord's death until He comes'
If Christ is not in someone, that one is not a Christian; if Christ is not in a group of people, they are not the church
Speaking of Christians, we may say that Christians are Christ; speaking of the church, we may say that the church also is Christ
Apart from Christ, a Christian is devoid of spiritual experiences; apart from Christ, the church is also devoid of spiritual experiences
If we do not touch or experience Christ, we will not gain Him, and our experience cannot be counted as a spiritual experience
In the same way, our mind can study the doctrines concerning Christ, but our mind cannot receive Christ Himself
A certain book containing questions and answers about the church tells people that baptism is a ceremony for joining the church
Verse 3 says, 'Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death'?
To believe in the Lord is to receive Christ, and when we open our heart to receive Christ, this is to believe in the Lord
Generally, every Christian should know Christ's death, but to this day very few Christians have really understood it
The baptism with which the Lord was baptized refers to His death, and the cup which He drank refers to the shedding of His blood
Judas, the disciple who loved money, rebuked her, saying, 'Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor'?
If a person always haggles over money and is calculating in material things, his love will be reduced to nothing by his calculating
The Lord testified for this sister, Mary, telling the disciples to leave her alone because she had done a noble deed to Him
The first gospel is that the Lord Jesus died for us, and the second gospel is that we know and comprehend His death
Mary was the only one among the disciples who was conformed to the Lord's death in the experience of dying with Him
There was one among them, Mary, who came early to the tomb while it was yet dark on the day of the Lord Jesus' resurrection
Mary saw that the stone was taken away from the tomb and ran to the disciples and told them that someone had taken the Lord out of the tomb
Peter and John ran to the tomb, but when they saw that the dead body was no longer there, they went back to their own homes
A person who really loves the Lord will love Him to such an extent that he would not care for his own status nor count the cost
When the two disciples saw that the Lord was not in the tomb, they went away because they were too calm and too clear
Many Christians quote Romans 9:16, which says, 'So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy'
The content of the church is Christ, and the intrinsic reality of every single matter in the church is Christ Himself
Once we mention the breaking of bread, almost all Christians will say that breaking bread is for remembering the Lord
Based on this word, many Christians conclude that the significance of bread breaking is the remembrance of the Lord
We feel we need to contemplate His burial, His resurrection, His ascension, and His sending of the Holy Spirit
The Lord did not tell the disciples that at the Lord's table they had to quiet their hearts to meditate on Him in remembrance of Him
If He had not died or shed His blood, He could not have any relationship with us and would not have a way to enter into us
The reason why He can enter into us is because He died and shed His blood and thus became edible and drinkable to us
Now whenever we turn to our spirit believing and receiving the Lord who died and shed His blood for us we eat His flesh and drink His blood
We believe that in His body He bore our sins on the cross, that He died for us, and that His blood was shed for us on the cross
In God's eyes, when we believe and receive the Lord in this way, we are eating His flesh and drinking His blood
To eat the Lord's flesh and drink the Lord's blood is to receive the Lord Himself as our enjoyment, our life within, and our food
In the past when we remembered the Lord, many of our concepts were religious and much of our remembrance was in our mind
Only when we use our spirit and are in our spirit can we touch the Lord, worship the Lord, and genuinely remember the Lord
The bread and cup we touch outwardly signify His body that was given for us and His blood that was shed for us
Now we not only receive the visible bread and cup outwardly, but at the same time, we also touch and receive the Lord Himself in our spirit
Just as he was not happy with his wife before the Lord's table, he also was not happy with her after the meeting
After the Lord's table, and after this meditation and prayer in his mind, he still had not been touched by the Lord inwardly
If we really know what it is to remember the Lord, we will definitely eat and drink to our heart's content at the Lord's table
Every time we remember the Lord, we will be able to say with boldness that all of our hunger and thirst are fully satisfied
When people ask us about what we are eating and drinking, we can tell them readily that we are eating and drinking the Lord Jesus
Philippians 120b says But with all boldness as always even now Christ will be magnified in my body whether through life or through death
When we say that a certain thing equals our life, it means that we regard that thing as something important, something closely related to us
He is not only the object of our believing, the reality of our baptism, and the content of our bread breaking, but He is our life
Many Christians think that after a person is saved, all his problems before God are related to the matter of improving his behavior
Since he is saved, all his problems before God would be dealt with if he could improve his behavior after his salvation
Please remember, however, that after a person is saved and becomes a Christian, God's demand on him is much higher than these things
After a person is saved, what God wants is not to improve his behavior nor to uplift his morality but to change his life
In the beginning we did not have Gods life but when we believed in the Lord Jesus and received Him as our Savior Gods life was added into us
In his own life there are all kinds of wickedness, such as evil, filthiness, darkness, hatred, jealousy, guile, and covetousness
The life that is added into him, because it is the life of God, is good, bright, meek, loving, righteous, and holy
We are so complicated and so contradictory; sometimes we are like bad people, and other times we are like true gentlemen
There is pride in our humility, hatred in our love, falsehood in our honesty, and there are evil intentions even in our good intentions
Formerly he lived by his own life, but now God wants him to live by God's life in him instead of by his own life
Many people, owing to their habit of lighting kerosene lamps, still prefer lighting kerosene lamps instead of switching on electric lamps
We all know that if a kerosene lamp is not shining, it will not smoke; however, the more the kerosene lamp shines, the more it smokes
The more we try to do good by ourselves, the more mistakes we commit; that is, the more we 'shine,' the more we 'smoke'
The reason why we can move and think is that we have life within us, and all of our actions are according to this life and are of this life
That Christ is our life means that all of our actions, thoughts, words, and doings are according to Christ and are of Christ
Our moving is Christ's moving in us, our speaking is Christ's speaking in us, and our thinking is Christ's thinking in us
The basic principle of the Christian living is to be in Christ, by Christ, and of Christ for the gaining of Christ
Most people have the concept that a Christian is one who observes rules and regulations, has a high morality, and is honest and upright
Only when we have Christ as our life are we really Christians, and only when we live out calmness by Christ are we really Christians
A person who merely lives out virtues such as calmness, meekness, and propriety is not necessarily a Christian
We cannot judge a Christian only according to his outward living; we must also judge him according to his inner life
If we apply this principle or main point in examining our own living, can we say that we live and walk by Christ today?
The question is not whether we are Christians who do good or evil but whether we are Christians who live by ourselves or by Christ
Are all of our words, our thoughts, and even our views and judgments about every matter according to ourselves or according to Christ?
We may be able to say that we are moralists and well-behaved persons, but we may not be able to say that we are Christians
We may give all the ground in us to meekness, quietness, and good behavior, but we may not give any ground to Christ
Every day we may still be living by ourselves with fear and trembling, being full of meekness, quietness, and humility yet without Christ
People may praise us for our meekness and quietness, but they cannot see Christ in us because Christ has vanished from us
Even though we have believed in the Lord and now belong to the Lord, there is one thing that we have not seen accurately
God's purpose is for Christ to be our life, yet we who are saved do not have much realization that Christ is our life
If we see this clearly, we will have a deep sense that apart from Him we can do nothing and that apart from Him we cannot live
If we had the right understanding, we would know that our seeking God and our slothfulness in not seeking God are actually the same
Merely reading the Bible, praying, and meeting does not mean that we are spiritual, for these things cannot satisfy God
What counts and what can satisfy God's heart is that Christ is in our reading of the Bible, in our praying, and in our attending meetings
God's purpose is not in our attending meetings, in our being zealous, in our reading the Bible, or in our praying
We all must know this principle to the extent that we abhor ourselves and all of our living that comes out of ourselves
A Christian may live out love, meekness, and goodness, but if these things are without Christ, they are still of himself
If we do something by ourselves, even though it may be good, meek, and humble, it will not win God's praise and acceptance
We have never denied, depreciated, and trampled under our feet the things in us that are appreciated by others
We confess the name of the Lord we serve the Lord and we come near to the Lord yet we still have the basic problem of not denying ourselves
It seems that although both sins and the world may no longer have much ground in us, Christ does not have much ground in us either
We may think that we are for Christ and live by Christ, but in fact, we still live in ourselves and by ourselves
Humanly speaking, they really have improved, but spiritually, there is no change or advancement in their knowledge of Christ
Some may say that the cup is for containing water and should not be covered with a handkerchief because it does not look nice
When Christ is formed in a Christian, and the measure of his stature is increased within him, this is Christian progress
When we notice that someone has an improvement in his behavior, we say that he has made some spiritual progress
Whenever Christ increases in the saints, their speaking will be reduced; whenever Christ increases in them, their bad temper will diminish
If a person's bad temper is reduced, yet there is no increase of Christ, then his change is merely something ethical
If we see this, we will turn our concept from morality to Christ, and we will treasure Christ more than morality
When we are seriously seeking Christ, He will have the ground in us and will move in us, speak to us, and touch us
Because we treasure Him, seek Him, and touch Him, He will have the opportunity in us, and His Spirit will be able to move in us and touch us
On the one hand, we will have the increase of Christ inwardly, and on the other hand, we will have a change of expression outwardly
There are many Christians who do not treasure morality, but in the end their morality is higher than that of others
When Christ is lived out through him, Christ not only increases in him but also grows in him into a full-grown man and is formed in him
Because Christ is filling him to be his everything, Christ's view will become his view and Christ's thought will become his thought
His thoughts will be Christ, his concepts will be Christ, his inclinations will be Christ, and his judgments will also be Christ
At this time, everything that he does and all of his living are worthless in God's eyes and do not mean anything
We may have a great amount of doctrinal knowledge and many spiritual practices, but they cannot be counted as spiritual progress
When the branches abide in the vine, they bear fruit, and the life of the vine is expressed through the branches
The issue of such a union is the overflow of Christ's life, Christ's nature, and Christ Himself in our Christian living
The showing forth and the expression of the electricity is the 'fruit bearing' of the lamp, the effect of the lamp
If we think that our gospel preaching is for people to 'go to heaven' and not to 'hell,' then our gospel preaching is too poor
We may kneel down before God and in tears pray, 'O God, please save him because You desire all men to be saved and not one to perish
We all should preach the gospel in this way-to transmit the Christ from within us into our friends and everyone in our family
When a person cannot distinguish his left hand from his right, and we go to visit him, we want him to have a clear mind
Because we do not see this matter clearly and do not take it seriously, we miss the center and purpose of our gospel preaching and visiting
Whether they are indifferent, backslidden, or befuddled, we have only one goal, and that is to transfuse Christ into them
When Paul wrote the book of Philippians in his old age, he still confessed that he did not have an adequate knowledge of Christ
Corinthians 1:30 says that Christ 'became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
Only when we are in Christ and allow Christ to pass through us and to flow out of us will all that we do count
When we go to preach the gospel, the gospel will be released through us; when we go to visit the saints, Christ will be released through us
We all know that if we are connected to the electricity, whenever we contact someone, the electricity in us will flow to that person
In the same principle, if we want Christ to pass through us and to reach others through us, we must be those who are in fellowship with Him
Before a person begins to preach the gospel or minister the word, he must first have fellowship with the Lord and contact Him
It is only by fellowshipping with the Lord on the one hand and by speaking the message on the other hand that his message can be living
Visiting the believers is Christ Himself, preaching the gospel is Christ Himself, and preaching the word is Christ Himself
If Christ is not the center and the reality, the word itself will be empty, the visiting will be false, and the gospel will be dead
Whether we are preaching the gospel, visiting the believers, or serving as an elder, we must always be connected to Christ whenever we serve
Sometimes we may have the experience that right before we are going to speak, our inner fellowship with the Lord is interrupted
At this time, we should go to the Lord immediately to deal with what needs to be dealt with in order to restore the fellowship
We may speak thousands of messages or do thousands of things, but in all of them our unique goal must be Christ
Corinthians 12:12 begins, 'For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body'
The strange thing, however, is that the conclusion to this word refers not to the church but to Christ-'so also is the Christ'
When the Holy Spirit inspired man to write the Bible, He did not say, 'So also is the church,' but 'so also is the Christ'
Based on this we can determine that in God's eyes, not only is the Head of the church Christ, but the church is also Christ
Because the church is something spiritual, without Christ there is no church, and without Christ there is no reality of the church
If we have an experience that is not Christ Himself, this experience is religious and behavioral but not spiritual
Any 'Christian' experience that is not derived from the experience of Christ is something of religion, ethics, and good behavior
If we gather a group of people together on the street and put up a 'church' signboard next to them, they still are not the church
What counts and has spiritual value before God is what we do while we are abiding in the Lord and the Lord is abiding in us
For the Lord to abide in us means that the Lord is joined to us, whereas for us to abide in the Lord means that we are joined to the Lord
Only when we are in union with Christ will what we do be something that Christ does through us, and only this has spiritual value to God
All that we do out of ourselves, with ourselves, and by ourselves can gain the praises of man but not the acceptance of God
Not only will our sins be unacceptable to God, but even the good things we do by ourselves will not be accepted by Him
We do not need to touch Christ to engage in secular matters, but we must contact Him for the service of the church
When we go to visit the believers, preach the gospel, or lead people to salvation, Christ as the electricity will flow out from us into them
Spiritual service is outward action that issues from touching the inward feeling of Christ; this action is Christ's coming out of us
When the Spirit touches us, it is Christ who is touching us, and when the Spirit motivates us, it is Christ who is motivating us
Although we may be only cleaning, we are still able to give people a flavor that is spiritual and heavenly-the fragrance of Christ
We sense his eloquence, but we cannot sense the Lord's presence with him, neither can we touch spiritual reality
If you preach the gospel better than others and bring many people to salvation, this is your spiritual ability
The blood circulation of the ears is the blood circulation of the body and the life of the ears is the life of the body the life of the head
When this life comes to the ears, it becomes the life of the ears, and when this life comes to the eyes, it becomes the life of the eyes
A newborn baby can barely see with its eyes, hear with its ears, walk with its feet, or do things with its hands
Just as every member of our physical body has its own function as saved ones and members of the Body of Christ we each have our own function
God has already ordained that every saved one be a member and that every member have a gift, an ability, and a function
Although it is the same life of Christ that we receive, this life becomes different members in different people
In addition, even though they all are members, the functions of some have been manifested, but the functions of others have not
Although he regularly attended the meetings and sometimes prayed with tears, his mind and his thinking could not be turned around
Not only did he know how to read the Bible properly, but when he stood up to read the Bible in the meetings, his reading was full of feeling
When a baby is first born and is lying on the bed, his feet are lovely, but they cannot walk because they are not yet developed
The only reason for this is that the life in them has not grown or matured and that Christ has no ground in them
How much of our gift is manifested and how useful we can be in the Lord's hands do not depend on the Lord but depend entirely on us
The manifestation of all the gifts depends on whether or not we are willing to give the Lord the ground for His life to develop in us
If there is a member who seems not to have any function, it is because he has not given Christ the opportunity to develop and mature in him
We have to pray, to come back to the Lord, to put ourselves aside, and to entrust ourselves entirely to the Lord
The development of this life is based on our fellowship with the Lord, and our fellowship with the Lord is based upon our love for the Lord
When the Lord has the ground in us, the Holy Spirit will have the ground in us, and our spiritual gift will be manifested
In this way the Body of Christ will function, the condition of the church will be normal, and God will be able to gain true worship
