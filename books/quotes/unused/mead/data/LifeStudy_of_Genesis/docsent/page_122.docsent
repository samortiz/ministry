   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE NINETEEN GOD'S DEALING WITH MAN'S FIRST FALL 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous message we studied the first fall of man, considering its cause, process, and result.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen how dreadful was the cause, how awful was the process, and how terrible was the result.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank God that Genesis 3 does not stop here!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Genesis 3 not only unveils the cause, process, and result of man's first fall, but also reveals the way God used to deal with this fall.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His way is the way of salvation, and the message or the word regarding His way is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are preaching the gospel to all who read this message.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first occurrence of gospel preaching in the entire universe is recorded in chapter three of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not think that Genesis 3 is a negative chapter; it is very positive.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although this chapter begins with the evil one, the subtle, crafty serpent, this serpent opened the way for the seed of the woman to come in. This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who is the seed of the woman?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Jesus was born of a woman, not of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The so-called higher critics, who attacked the book of Genesis and Revelation, also claimed that Jesus was not born of a virgin, alleging that He was born of Joseph, the carpenter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such an assertion is the greatest blasphemy against the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord was not the son of that carpenter who later became the husband of the virgin Mary, of which virgin Jesus was born.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, Jesus was not the seed of any man; He was the seed of a woman, a virgin, as prophesied in Isaiah 7:14 , fulfilled in Matthew 1:23 , and confirmed by Paul Gal 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Galatians 4:4 Paul says that Christ was born of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Jesus was not the seed of man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was the seed of a woman, born to fulfill the promise given by God as the gospel in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first fall of man opened the way for the seed of woman to come in. This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's Way of Dealing</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>with the First Fall of Man</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we need to consider God's way of dealing with the first fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God did not judge man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Immediately after the fall both Adam and Eve realized that they were not very good.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They condemned themselves, hid themselves, and used fig leaves to cover themselves Gen 3:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Adam and Eve hid themselves from the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They knew that they had violated God's prohibition against eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge and that the result of their transgression was to be death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, they hid themselves from the Lord's presence, awaiting the sentence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, God came in, not to declare the sentence of death, but to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God did not pronounce the sentence of death; He sounded the voice of the gospel.</S>
