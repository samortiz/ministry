<h1 class="title">ENTERING THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:7-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">REST, THE SPIRIT, THE HIGH PRIEST,<br />
AND THE THRONE OF GRACE</h2>
<p>Several matters are mentioned in Hebrews 4:7-16. The first matter is rest: &ldquo;There remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God&rdquo; (v. 9). The second matter is the spirit: &ldquo;The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit&rdquo; (v. 12). The third matter is the High Priest: &ldquo;Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God&rdquo; (v. 14). The fourth matter is the throne of grace: &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace&rdquo; (v. 16). This portion of the Word reveals rest, the spirit, the High Priest, and the throne of grace.</p>
<p>These four matters are related, but if we do not understand how they are related, it will be hard to understand this portion of the Word. There are few believers in Christianity who understand this portion, most of whom divide this portion into three or four separate sections: the Sabbath rest, the dividing of the soul and the spirit, the High Priest, and the throne of grace. The believers who are more advanced connect the High Priest to the throne of grace. Strictly speaking, however, there is a relationship not only between the High Priest and the throne of grace. All four items&mdash;rest, the spirit, the High Priest, and the throne of grace&mdash;are related.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Rest Remaining for God&rsquo;s People<br />
Being in Their Spirit</h2>
<p>This portion of the Word reveals that the rest remaining for God&rsquo;s people is in our spirit. If we do not know how to enter into our spirit, it will be hard for us to know how to enter into rest. Ever since I was saved, I began to study the Bible seriously; however, at that time I was very much under the influence of Brethren teaching. The Brethren, using the way of prophecy, interpreted the rest as the millennial kingdom. They said that the millennial kingdom is the rest that God prepared for His people and that we must be diligent to enter into it. If we read only verse 9, we will think that their exposition seems to be correct. However, if we continue on to verse 12, we will sense that this interpretation does not connect verse 9 with verse 12, which says, &ldquo;The word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart.&rdquo; Why does Paul speak of rest in verse 9 and in verse 12 of the living and operative word of God? What is the purpose of verse 12? If we break out of the influence of traditional Christianity, we will understand that the rest in verse 9 must be in our spirit.</p>
<p>Verse 9 says that there is a rest remaining for God&rsquo;s people. Verse 10 says that to enter into this rest is to rest from our works. If we are still struggling, we do not have rest. Verse 11 says that we should be diligent to enter into God&rsquo;s rest. Then verse 12 says that the word of God is living and that it can divide our soul from our spirit. When we read these verses sequentially, we must admit that the rest in verse 9 refers to the spirit in verse 12.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word of God Being Able to Pierce<br />
Even to the Dividing of Soul and Spirit<br />
to Expose Our Real Situation</h2>
<p>Verse 13 is difficult to understand. Verse 12 says that God&rsquo;s word is living and able to divide the soul and the spirit, and verse 13 says that all things are manifest before the Lord, being naked and laid bare. How do we connect verses 12 and 13? Verse 13 indicates that God is able to see man&rsquo;s inward condition. First Samuel 16:7 says, &ldquo;Man looks on the outward appearance, but Jehovah looks on the heart.&rdquo; In the New Testament age, God does not look merely on our heart; He looks on our spirit.</p>
<p>None of us is naked or laid bare before others, because they can see only our outward appearance; they cannot see the condition of our spirit. In contrast, God can see into our being. He sees our outward appearance, the thoughts and intentions of our heart, and also our spirit, which is surrounded by and hidden in our soul (Heb. 4:12). In the book of Hebrews Paul did not speak of man from the human point of view; rather, he spoke from God&rsquo;s view. God&rsquo;s view is sharper than any x-ray; His eyes can penetrate into our spirit. God desires to show us where we are, that is, whether we are living in the flesh or in the soul and whether we are living in the thoughts and intentions of our heart or in our spirit. He shines into us so that we may have a clear view of our condition.</p>
<p>We often are not clear concerning our condition. After attending a few meetings and hearing some messages, some people think that they have seen a vision and that their condition has changed. It is not until God&rsquo;s light shines on them, however, that they realize that their &ldquo;change&rdquo; is superficial and not from their spirit. Although we are not naked and laid bare before one another, we are naked and laid bare before the Lord. Verse 12 says that the word of God is living and operative and able to pierce our being even to the deepest part, our spirit. God&rsquo;s word represents God; hence, it can pierce and divide our inward parts to expose our real situation. We cannot hide before God; rather, we are naked and laid bare before Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Central Vision for Serving the Church &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
