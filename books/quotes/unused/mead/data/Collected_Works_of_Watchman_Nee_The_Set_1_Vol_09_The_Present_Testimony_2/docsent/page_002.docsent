   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO MY DEAR READERS Issue No. 19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have not met with you in this publication for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thank God that He has allowed me to rest in Him and once again take up the responsibility of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My illness during the last two or three years has surely been used by God to test the compassions of many saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My weakness has become the opportunity for many to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I consider your love and kindness toward me, how grateful I am!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I hear of the many brothers and sisters scattered in different places who, though they have not met me, yet because of our relationship in the Lord, have wept bitterly before Him for my health, I feel that what you have bestowed upon me is so deep while that which I have given you is so shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because of this I cannot help feeling that if I had more life, energy, and time, how much I would like to spend it on the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Though my sickness has been accumulating over many years, it was worsened by writing The Spiritual Man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank God, now I am recovering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am again able to write a few letters, prepare a few articles, lead several Bible study sessions, and attend a few meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There are still many other things I could wish to do but cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Still I am thankful to God for what I can do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who know the human body say that I have been close to death several times, but thank God He has been keeping me up to this day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I hope that in the days of my sojourning on this earth I may be able to serve Him and you faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would like to say a few words concerning the goal of the work of the co-workers in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We deeply feel that there is a lack in the church in China today because many do not realize the meaning of genuine spiritual work and the way that one should take before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we hope that we can contact those who are seeking the Lord in all places and render them some help.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may think that the content of The Present Testimony is too deep and too specialized.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, many readers have written to us saying that while other magazines are greatly used by the Lord, The Present Testimony provides what the others do not.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For this reason we are convinced that the command which we have received of the Lord is right.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By the grace of the Lord, The Present Testimony will therefore continue to speak forth the deep things of God this year and in the years to come, the Lord willing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The gospel tracts that we have published have been truly blessed by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have given away over five million tracts during the past two to three years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This year alone, we have printed over 1.5 million tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have no lack of money for printing, although we have asked contributions from no one, and no one has given us an endowment fund.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Himself has put the need of this work in the hearts of men, and little contributions given here and there enable us to accomplish what He wishes us to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We really thank Him!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The article published in this issue of The Present Testimony, "Self-knowledge and God's Light," is indispensable knowledge for God's children who are going on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May God use it to release the ones in bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We hope that as you read it, you will pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Friends, the time is truly short!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our Lord is at the door!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May we seize this last opportunity to give ourselves to God's will and be led to the place that is after His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>May we be faithful and not regret when we look back in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He loves us and has given Himself for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He should have our all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May there be nothing that will give rest to our hearts in this desolate wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May our eyes be set all the time on the Lord who is not here.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peace be to you!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A household slave of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Watchman Nee, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>February 28, 1931</S>
