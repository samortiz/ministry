	<p>CHARGING HIS SERVANT WITH THE LORD • Abraham did not charge his servant to be faithful, honest, or to do a good work; he charged him with and by the Lord (vv. 2-3, 9, 40-41). Here we see that the atmosphere in which Abraham lived was the Lord Himself. By charging his servant with the Lord, he brought him deep into the Lord. Likewise, we should not charge people with our wisdom or even with our love, but with the Lord.<p>BELIEVING IN THE SOVEREIGN LORD • Abraham believed in the sovereign Lord, telling his servant that the Lord would send His angel with him and prosper his way (v. 40). Abraham seemed to be saying, “God will send His angel before you. Although I am sending you to do the job, I believe in God. In a sense, I don’t believe that you can accomplish this work, but I trust in the living God. You don’t need to be burdened or to worry. Just go and do the job, for my God will send His angel to do the work for you.” What a life Abraham had! If we had been Abraham, we might have said, “My servant, you must realize that I have passed through many experiences. Let me now give you a map and tell you of the people and their customs.” Abraham did not do this. Rather, he only charged his servant to serve by the Lord, assuring him that God would send His angel before him and prosper his way. Here we see Abraham’s living faith.<h2 class=head1>THE OLDEST SERVANT</h2><p>FAITHFUL IN RESPONSIBILITYFAbraham’s oldest servant was faithful in responsibility (vv. 5, 9, 33, 54, 56). He followed Abraham’s footsteps in being faithful. I believe that he was infused by and with Abraham’s life, seeing how Abraham did everything by trusting in the Lord. As a result, the servant also trusted in Him.<p>TRUSTING IN THE LORD FOR HIS RESPONSIBILITY • Abraham’s servant trusted in the Lord for his responsibility (vv. 12, 21, 42). He prayed to the Lord in a clear, humble, yet simple way. Everyone who truly believes in God is simple. When he came to the well near the city of Nahor, he prayed, saying, “O Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send me good success this day, and shew kindness unto my master Abraham. Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: and let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master” (vv. 12-14, Heb.). His prayer was answered immediately. Before he had even finished speaking, Rebekah came with her pitcher upon her shoulder. When he asked her for a drink, she not only gave him a drink but also drew water for all his camels. After she had done this, the servant was clear that Rebekah was the one and he gave her a ring and two bracelets.<p>LOOKING FOR THE LORD’S LEADING IN THE ENVIRONMENT • The servant knew the Lord’s will by looking for His leading in the environment (vv. 13-21, 26-27, 48-49). We also can see God’s sovereignty in our environment. No one told the servant to go to the city of Nahor, the city of Abraham’s brother. He just went there and at the well he met Rebekah, Nahor’s granddaughter. Nothing was accidental; everything was ordained before the foundation of the world and was carried out through Abraham’s servant, a man who trusted in God.<h2 class=head1>REBEKAH</h2><p>CHASTE, KIND, AND DILIGENT • In verse 16 we are told that Rebekah was “very fair to look upon, a virgin.” Rebekah was chaste and pure. She was also kind and diligent (vv. 18-20). When Abraham’s servant asked for a drink, she immediately gave it to him. She also drew water for his camels. It was hard work for a young woman to draw water out of the well and pour it into the trough for ten camels to drink, but she did it. If the young sisters want to be under God’s sovereignty, especially with respect to their marriage, they need to be kind and diligent. Any young woman who is unkind and sloppy should remain single. When people ask you to do one thing, you must do two things for them. And the second thing should far surpass the first thing. You should not only give a man water to drink, but should also draw water for his ten camels. If you do this, you will be qualified to obtain your husband, your Isaac. This is some advice to all the young single sisters.
