        <h2 class="head1">SEEING THE VISION OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Not many saints have seen a vision or received revelation. Most saints live according to their emotions. Hence, their relationships with others and with the Lord are based on emotions. Just like the maiden in the first section of Song of Songs, they lack objective vision.</p>
<p>The objective and higher vision begins in Song of Songs 2:8 and 9: &ldquo;Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills. / My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart.&rdquo; Before this time the seeker has spiritual experiences, but she lacks vision. Her utterances in her praises and prayers come from the feelings that she gains in her experiences. Although this is precious, she cannot go forward if she remains in these experiences.</p>
<p>Hence, at the beginning of the second stage the beloved comes in. The seeker did not ask the beloved to come, but he comes to remind her. In the first stage a seeker has an affectionate and loving fellowship with the Lord, having tasted His sweetness and enjoyed His abundance. This is portrayed in the words of the seeker in Song of Songs: &ldquo;While the king was at his table, / My spikenard gave forth its fragrance. / My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh / That lies at night between my breasts. / My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers / In the vineyards of En-gedi... / As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: / In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste. / He brought me into the banqueting house, / And his banner over me was love&rdquo; (1:12-14; 2:3-4). This description shows that she enjoys the beloved&rsquo;s abundance and experiences his sweetness. At the same time, however, she retreats into a room and unknowingly shuts her beloved out. This room is not completely closed, because it has a window, an opening, through which she can see her beloved. He is leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills like a young hart (vv. 8-9). There is no feeling of sweetness or enjoyment from rest and satisfaction in these verses. What the seeker sees is the expression of strength, vitality, and power. She sees her beloved leaping and skipping upon the mountains and hills like a young hart. Mountains are high, but a young hart is able to leap and skip upon them. Instead of being impressed by something subjective or experiential, the seeker sees an objective vision.</p>
<p>The serving ones, in particular, need to see this vision. Most of the saints still live according to feelings. We expect to be satisfied with the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness, but instead of having fresh and sweet feelings, we are low, oppressed, and deadened. Therefore, we think that we either have a problem, have fallen, or are no longer useful in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. In addition, our environment is full of &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; and &ldquo;hills.&rdquo; Some of us have health problems, some have family problems, and some have problems at work, problems with the co-workers, or problems in the church. Formerly, everything in our living and our service was smooth, and our way was straight, level, and full of light. But it is no longer so. There are hills and high mountains everywhere; there is no way out. Our situation is truly difficult. It is in this kind of situation that we need a vision, an objective seeing, a further knowledge of the Lord.</p>
<p>We seem to be advancing in our knowledge of the Lord, but our experiences are still in the first stage of Song of Songs. Our praises, thanksgiving, prayers, and testimonies indicate that our relationship with the Lord is still in the first stage. In our experience we know that the Lord is lovely and satisfying. But such knowledge of the Lord is insufficient; we must know the Lord in more ways. We need to experience the Lord in the second stage of Song of Songs.</p>
<p>The experience of the second stage is not a matter of the Lord giving us rest and satisfaction but of our seeing Him as the resurrected Lord, who has the power and vitality to leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills in His move. In the first stage the seeker wants to go to the beloved in order to receive satisfaction and rest. Now, instead of her asking, the Lord calls her, saying, &ldquo;Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away&rdquo; (v. 10). This is a matter of moving, not of enjoyment. For our enjoyment we need satisfaction and rest, but for our move we need power and vitality. The beloved says, &ldquo;Rise up...and come away; / For now the winter is past; / The rain is over and gone. / Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. / ...come away&rdquo; (vv. 10-13). In such an atmosphere of resurrection and freshness the Lord wants His seekers to rise up and come away with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A FURTHER SEEING OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>Although the beloved is calling, the seeker lingers in herself. She says, &ldquo;My beloved is mine, and I am his; / He pastures his flock among the lilies&rdquo; (v. 16). She has not forgotten that the beloved is her enjoyment; she cannot drop the matter of enjoyment. This picture can be applied to our situation. Many saints are old and deadened because they have been living according to their emotions for so long but are still unwilling to come out of their emotions. Some say, &ldquo;Our situation was better five years ago when it was so sweet to pray and fellowship with the brothers, but it is no longer like that. The feeling of sweetness is no longer strong.&rdquo; This shows our unwillingness to part with the past. Such sentiments are in the self and are based on our feelings.</p>
<p>Such lingering thoughts are useless. If we remain in the past, we will also lose the Lord&rsquo;s presence, because He cannot remain in the past. Hence, the experiences from the first stage of Song of Songs are useless in the second stage. What the seeker sees at the beginning of the second stage is something not within her self&mdash;not in her feelings and not in her imagination. She sees a vision that is outside of the self: &ldquo;Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills. / My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart&rdquo; (vv. 8-9). Such a vision shows that the Lord wants us to stop living according to our emotions, that is, to stop caring for our enjoyment, satisfaction, and rest. We must break away from these things and see that the Lord is in resurrection. By such a seeing, we will take a further step and know the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>It is not so easy for those who live in the experiences of the first stage to be delivered from their feelings. In the second stage the beloved gives his seeker a vision of himself as a young hart leaping upon the mountains and skipping upon the hills, and he also calls her to rise up and come away with him (vv. 8-13). However, the seeker remains in the feelings of her former experiences (v. 16). As a result, the beloved leaves. In 3:1 the seeker is on her bed lingering in her spiritual enjoyment, but she cannot find her beloved. Hence, she is compelled to leave the place of her enjoyment and go out into the streets to seek him (v. 2). At first she cannot find him, but he later appears to her, and she holds on to him and drags him into her enjoyment (v. 4). Thus, it is not easy to break away from living for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>It is possible for us to remain in the stage of living according to our feelings for a long time. Perhaps some of us will now experience something new and have a new revival. However, I am concerned that those who are revived will repeat the mistake of holding on to the Lord and forcing Him to stay in their past experiences. The period of silence in verse 5 is rather lengthy. The seeker stays there for a long time. In other words, she returns to living according to her emotions. The seeker&rsquo;s condition changes at the beginning of the third stage, which is after this long period of silence. In the third stage she is like pillars of smoke, soaring and transcendent (v. 6). She is also Solomon&rsquo;s palanquin (v. 9), meaning that she is able to move. Hence, in the third stage we are delivered from living according to our enjoyment and are in the Lord&rsquo;s move. We experience this change after we have further knowledge of resurrection.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
