   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>L. Helping Others to Become Proper Vessels</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only do the elders have to exercise patience to help the brothers and sisters learn, they have to help them to become proper vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not worry that their function may become greater than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to hope that among your disciples some will become the laureates.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Chinese have a saying that one only finds laureate students and never laureate teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The teacher may not be a laureate, but among his students, some may become laureates.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not be afraid that among those whom you are leading, some will become more useful or capable than you are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If such a thing indeed happens, it should be your glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How glorious a thing it would be if among those whom you lead, some would become a Peter, a Paul, or a greatly-used vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to do your best to perfect and help them to become proper vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I believe the brothers and sisters can realize that except the point about ascertaining life in a person, which is relatively easy to do, all the other points, from the second point on, are difficult to carry out.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not one point is easy to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let me repeat: this is a matter of laboring.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not have the time or the occasion to point out all the details of every point.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For many years I have hoped to sit down with a group of elders once a week and fellowship with them about how to help people become proper vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here is a person who loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How will you help him become a useful vessel?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many things need to be considered in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I can never forget those elderly brothers who have rendered me help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can never forget the way they have perfected me.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without that perfecting, I know that I would be a completely different person today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I can be at least a little useful today because they have perfected me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I think I can give a little testimony here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From 1930 to 1934, when I was very young and had just entered into the Lord's calling, I went to Shanghai, where the center of the Lord's work for the whole country was located.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I first arrived, the one who was leading me handed over to me the platform of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whether I could do that work or not, I had to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I knew that he was giving me an opportunity in order to perfect me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, the Gospel Book Room, which has a history of over forty years among us, was the responsibility of Brother Nee alone during 1933 and 1934.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Within a very short time, he quickly handed over to me a part of the responsibility for the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I admit that I could not do this work, for I had never done it before.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But here was an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was thankful to the Lord, and I was also extremely grateful to our brother!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To me this was a kind of perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By the Lord's mercy, I can see the result of that perfecting twenty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today, we can have a book room and the publication of some literature all because of this perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I received this commission in Shanghai, I was in fear and trembling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I had never worked with anyone else before that time, and I had never taken any lead in any work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I had only raised up a small meeting in a small place in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now suddenly a big meeting was put on my shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can never forget that very day, for many times I prayed only one prayer, the prayer of Solomon: "Lord, I am only a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You have raised me up to walk in and out among Your people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Lord, give me the wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When I look back now, I can see that many of the lessons were learned during that time; I was pressed into learning those lessons then.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That was a perfecting work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was a rare opportunity, one which could not be purchased with a million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, brothers, for the sake of the Lord, for the sake of His kingdom, His interest on earth, we have to learn to perfect a group of people and to make them the right vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Not only do we need a little perfecting; we need a great perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must clear the ground for them to have the opportunity to be perfected, so as to prepare them for future use.</S>
