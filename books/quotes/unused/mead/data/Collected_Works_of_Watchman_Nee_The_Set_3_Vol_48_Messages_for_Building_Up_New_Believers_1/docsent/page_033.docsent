   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Being Children of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Together with Many Others in God's Family</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After a person believes in the Lord, he receives not only an individual life but also a life that is related to many other people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As members of God's family, His dwelling place, and the Body of Christ, we are merely a part of the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is impossible for us to exist alone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we tried, we would surely miss the fullness and the riches in God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may be a useful part, but if we are not joined to others, we are like a piece of cloth cut off from the whole or a spare part of a big machine, and we cannot express the light of the fullness of the highest form of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The fullness of that light exists only in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One cannot live in a family with five brothers and sisters without being related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If I am the only child of my father, I do not have to deal with any brothers or sisters in the family, because I have none.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if I have five brothers and sisters in my family, I am no longer my father's only child; I am one of five children.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can I not be related to the other brothers and sisters and remain the only son to my father?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can I lock myself up in a room and tell the others, "Do not bother me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have nothing to do with you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am here to be my father's only son"?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can one do that?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a person believes in the Lord, he does not become God's only begotten son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is one among God's millions of sons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He cannot lock himself up and be his Father's only son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The very nature of the life you have received does not allow this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the physical family, you may be an only child without any brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But since the day you believed in the Lord, you are bound in fellowship to the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You cannot escape from this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On that day, you were born into the biggest family in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No other family is as big as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have millions and millions of brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You cannot belittle them just because there are so many of them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because you are only one among many, there is the need for you to know them; there is the need for you to fellowship with them and to be related to them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you have no desire at all to see them, I have doubts about whether or not you are really a brother or a sister.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are born of God, you will be drawn towards those who are also born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you can shut yourself off from them, I have doubts about whether or not you are a child of God at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The concept of being an individual Christian is not a Christian concept at all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This concept does not and should not belong to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our own family we should be brothers to all our brothers and sisters to all our sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How much more should this be true in the family of God?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This relationship flows forth from the life of God and is full of love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a strange thing for anyone to have no affection for his own brothers and sisters or to have no desire to communicate with them!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must remember that while we receive God's life to be His children individually, the life we obtain is also in thousands of other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am only one among many brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The very nature of the life I possess does not allow me to be individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It desires instead to communicate with all the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>B. Becoming God's Dwelling Place</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Together with Other Brothers and Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Bible also shows us that the church is God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is spoken of in Ephesians 2.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This fact is one of the greatest revelations in the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should realize that God has a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He needs a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the Bible we see the thought of a dwelling place from Moses' tabernacle to Solomon's temple, including the later rebuilding and restoration of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the church age God is making man His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God once dwelt in a big building Solomon's temple.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But today God dwells in the church; the church has now become the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have been gathered together to be the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We as God's many children have been gathered together by the Holy Spirit to be the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is covered in 1 Peter 2:5.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are the living stones being built into the spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How is the spiritual house built?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Solomon's temple was built with dead stones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But today the dwelling place of God is built with living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Peter, whose name means "a stone," was a living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When all the living stones come together, they become a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If they are not together, can one stone be a house by itself?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If no stone is upon another, it is a mark of desolation; this is not a good sign.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No stone being upon another is a result of judgment and desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As long as we have a house, we have one stone upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thank God that today we are saved and have believed in the Lord Jesus; we are now stones.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What use does a single stone have if it is left alone?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But when the stones are put together, they become a house.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When they are isolated, they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In fact, they may become stumbling stones instead of living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today we are like the accessory parts of a car.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When all the parts are assembled together, we have a car which can be driven around.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We dare not say that those who are living stones will become dead if they become isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But we can say that if a stone is not joined to other stones to be God's dwelling place, it will lose its function and spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As a living stone, we must be joined to other living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only then can we contain God and only then will God dwell among us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A hundred years ago an Englishman by the name of Mr. Stooneg said, "After I was saved, a most wonderful thing happened to me.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>One day I came to realize that I was building material in the dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is a most wonderful discovery."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The first time I read this, I did not think too much about it.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What is so wonderful about being building material in God's dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But today, as I ponder over it, I appreciate Mr. Stooneg's word.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Once such a feeling is in you, you will realize how wonderful this is.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are indeed material for the spiritual dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we, as building material, are detached from the building, we will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>At the same time, God's dwelling place cannot go on without us as stones.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Without us as stones, there will be holes in God's dwelling place, and thieves will get into this building.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Since I am the building material for God's dwelling place, God cannot go on without me.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Brothers, we must see that we are the building material the Holy Spirit is using for the building of God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If you are by yourself, you will lose God's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>You will not be able to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You must be joined to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Only then can you contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>A wooden bucket which contains and carries water is made out of pieces of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you remove a piece of wood from the bucket, the whole container will no longer hold water.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The nature of the individual pieces of wood has not changed, but the riches they contain have changed.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Each piece can be soaked with a little water, but it will never hold much water; it will lose all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We are God's house, and as soon as we become isolated we lose all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Brothers and sisters, you may not see it clearly today.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>But gradually you will see more and more clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>As soon as you believe in the Lord, spontaneously there is an inclination within you to contact other children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>There is a desire within you to look for other materials, other stones.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>You must go along with this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Do not isolate yourself from others through concepts of your own.</S>
