	 <h2 class="head2">The Absent Saints and the Children&rsquo;s Work</h2>
<p>We learn the proper lessons from studying our past. I have said in the past that we should train the brothers and sisters who plan to go abroad to study or work so that they will not leave the church life due to changes in their environment. Moreover, there are more than twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, but less than one-fourth of them actually come to the meetings. It is worthwhile for us to investigate the cause of such a high rate of absence from meetings. We need to find every one of the twenty thousand saints in order to understand the reason they are absent from the meetings. Some brothers must coordinate in order to meet this need.</p>
<p>Concerning the children&rsquo;s work, out of the twenty thousand saints there should be at least five thousand families. Even though many of the parents do not come to the meetings, their children do. If there are two children in every family, we will have ten thousand children. The church in Taipei should have ten thousand children attending its children&rsquo;s meetings during the week. These meetings do not have to be held in the meeting halls on Lord&rsquo;s Day mornings. We can have children&rsquo;s meetings any day from Monday to Lord&rsquo;s Day. These meetings can even be in the saints&rsquo; homes; every home can have a meeting. If the children begin to meet with us when they are six or seven years old, after ten years they will be at least sixteen years old; they will be ready to enter college. Moreover, they will all be saved. Even though we have fellowshipped repeatedly concerning this, the brothers have not received my words; they have not received this burden. They did not reject my words; they simply did not know how to carry them out.</p>
<p>If I had remained in Taiwan from 1961 until the present, we would have had a way to care for the saints who are not in the meetings. We cannot merely use our natural ability. The brothers must consider every saint on our list in prayer in order to know the condition of the saints and of the church in Taipei. We will then know the names of those who have incorrect addresses, those who have passed away, and those who became weak and left the church. We will also know the names of the saints who have a heart for the Lord. These saints might not necessarily meet regularly, but they come to the meetings a couple of times a year. If I had remained in Taiwan, the co-workers and the elders would have prayed and fellowshipped about this to find out how we should care for the twenty thousand saints on our list. This work requires our labor and effort. The way of doing things by convenience does not require any effort. However, we must apply some effort to meet new needs in a new situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Different Meetings<br />
to Meet Different Needs</h2>
<p>The church in Taipei is a large locality; no other locality has as many halls as the church in Taipei. Taiwan is richer than it has ever been in its history; we therefore do not have financial problems. In addition, we have more than one thousand young working saints. There are not many local churches with more than five hundred saints, including the young ones and the elderly. Hence, the church in Taipei has potential, a large financial capital, and resources. These more than twenty thousand saints must be our goal; we need to consider what meetings can meet their need. We must have different kinds of meetings to care for the different situations of the saints. After we preach the gospel, we must speak the truth of the gospel; therefore, we need a meeting to teach gospel truths. Furthermore, we need a meeting to edify new believers, a meeting to pursue the truth, and a meeting to pursue the divine life. Every week we should have at least five or six different kinds of meetings. They can all be in one meeting hall or in two to three different meeting halls. We do not necessarily need to gather in one place on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. We must spend time to consider these matters seriously according our need.</p>
<p>We need to classify the twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei by level according to their situation. We also need to study how to lead them in the meetings. It should not be that we use the Life-study messages until we find that they are not adequate and then switch to messages for edifying new believers until we find out that they do not meet the need and then switch to <em>Twelve Baskets Full.</em> If we do things in this way, nothing we use will be appropriate. A school cannot teach only English; it must teach geography, history, and physics also. For this reason, a school has many different classes; all the students are not in one class taking one general course. It takes less effort to do a general work, but we cannot speak concerning spiritual matters in a general way. We must pay attention to particular needs. We need to be practical in what we do. This can be compared to a chef who needs people to set up the kitchen and to help prepare food. The brothers cannot take only one way or do only one thing. They must care for the many different needs.</p>
<p>In principle, the church is a family, and the most important thing in a family is feeding. However, the church is also a school, and the most important thing in a school is education. For this reason, the Bible stresses teaching and teachers. When we perfect and edify the brothers and sisters, we should take the school system as our pattern and begin with elementary school, then progress to junior high school, high school, college, and finally graduate studies.</p>
