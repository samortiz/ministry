   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Praying Unceasingly That They May Be Brought into the Infilling and the Outpouring</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Essential and Economical Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Also, we need to pray unceasingly that we may be brought into the infilling and outpouring of the essential and economical Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The secret to being filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly is our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to be desperate in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An example of this is seen in Mark 10 with the blind beggar who desired to see.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He did not pray a composed prayer in a religious and formal way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He cried out desperately to the Lord by saying, "Son of David, have mercy on me!" v. 48 . Then the Lord said to him, "What do you want Me to do for you?" He responded, "That I may receive my sight!" v. 51 . We do not need formal, religious, composed prayers, but desperate prayers in which we tell the Lord directly what we want Him to do for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We need to pray, "Lord, make me vital!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Make me living and active!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I want to be a factor for the increase of the Lord's recovery."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also should pray desperately, "Lord, fill me up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Transfuse Yourself as the Spirit into my being, my constitution, and pour Yourself out as the Spirit of power upon me."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In order to be brought into the infilling and the outpouring of the essential and economical Spirit, we need to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 by exercising our spirit 1 Tim 4:7 to redeem the time Eph 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THEY SHOULD PICK UP THE BURDEN AND TAKE ACTION TO CONTACT OTHERS, EITHER SINNERS OR CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After we become vital and are grouped together in the vital groups, we need to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, we need to pick up a burden, and then we need to take action to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are vital, we will realize that among the churches in Southern California there is a desperate need for the proper increase.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For many years among us the rate of increase, especially among the Caucasian people, has been too low, yet it seems that not many of us have been touched by this matter and not many have picked up a real burden.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are vital, the Lord will be able to burden us in a definite and particular way to meet His need today.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord has a great need to have the proper increase in the churches in Southern California, especially among the typical Caucasian people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we need to put away so many things that are occupying and preoccupying our hearts and pick up a burden for the increase of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are vital, we will have the capacity to be burdened by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to be unloaded, we need to be released, and we need to be vitalized so that we can be burdened by the Lord for two things: the increase of the churches and the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the Lord's burden today, and this should be our burden.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nothing should occupy our hearts but what is on the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the Lord desires to see the churches in Southern California have the proper increase, and He also desires to see a real building up in the churches as the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord will do this through the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, we need to be burdened and vitalized to take this way absolutely and desperately.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After we pick up such a burden, we need to take definite action to go and contact others, either sinners or Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be vital is not only to be living but also to be burdened and very active for the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once we are living, we also need to be burdened and we need to take action to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should make a list of those who are unsaved among our relatives, friends, colleagues, and classmates, and we should begin to pray for them in a desperate way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While we are praying for them, we need to exercise our discernment according to the leading of the Spirit to select two or three from our list for us to work on for their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should have the loving concern of God's heart for the salvation of sinners, and we should be burdened not just to save souls but to convert sinners into members of the Body of Christ for the carrying out of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord may lead us not only to contact sinners but also to contact some Christians who are seeking, backslidden, or dormant, and gradually, little by little and step by step, to lead them into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must believe that there are some people in our sphere of influence who are being worked on by the sanctifying Spirit to separate them unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They need us to pick up a burden and to take definite action to go and contact them.</S>
