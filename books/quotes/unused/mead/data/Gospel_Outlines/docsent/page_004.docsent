   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Subject Three THE CENTER OF THE UNIVERSE MAN Scripture: Gen 2 Man is the highest one among all the creatures</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First speak about who is the highest one among all creatures in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Begin with the lifeless matters, then proceed to the living creatures from vegetable life to animal life, from the lowest to the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Finally talk about man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First say that the living creatures are higher than lifeless matter and that the conscious animal life is higher than the unconscious vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among the animals, man is the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Compare the life which comes from seed, from eggs, and from birth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Compare the life which comes from a short period of pregnancy, from a long period of pregnancy, and from man s birth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From this prove that man is the highest among all creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then say that man s wisdom, intelligence, and behavior also prove that man is the highest creature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Tigers, leopards, and lions, however fierce they may be, cannot conquer man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Finally, say that man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The reason man has wisdom, intelligence, and good behavior is that man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man s spirit not only causes man to have wisdom, intelligence, and good behavior, but it is also the very organ that desires God, seeks after God, and worships God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No other creature has a spirit; therefore, no other creature can desire God or worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The proof that man has a spirit: Man has a sense of guilt when he does something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Man has an inclination to seek after God and to worship Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man is the center of all the creatures</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is true that in preaching the gospel you need to rely on the power of the Holy Spirit; but those who have studied the Bible all acknowledge that the Bible is very logical.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, you also need to present the gospel in a logical way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Based upon man being the highest creature, prove that man is the center of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In any organization the highest one is also its center.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man is the highest among all the creatures; therefore, man is the center of all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based on the order and the ways of God s creation, prove that man is the center of all the creatures: In His creation, God created man after he had made all things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way God created man was different from the way He created other creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God created the others, He just said, Let the earth bring forth...and it was so.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible does not mention how He made them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in creating man, the Bible says that first He made the body, then the spirit, and finally man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the way God created man, prove that man is the center of all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The parts of man</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Man is composed of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man has these three parts; therefore, man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Note: If you did not start with the universe, but with man alone, you need to speak about the origin of man first.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If a man dies, we say that he is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The body is still there, but the spirit is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The existence within man of an inclination to worship God is a proof that man has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>With every race there is an inclination to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The meaning of man why man was created God s image: man is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How honorable this is!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How can man sin and do such base things?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s vessel: man is God s vessel, made to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today man always has an empty feeling because he does not have God inside of him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For instance, as a Coke bottle should be filled with Coca-cola, and an electric lamp should be filled with light, so man also should be filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the best way to touch people s feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Gospel preaching should be serious and yet relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a simple and effective way, explain that man is for God; therefore, the meaning of man is to be for God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually these are two aspects of one thing, but for the listeners you need to speak from these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man s position man s original position Man was to live in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man was over all creatures to rule them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man was sinless.</S>
