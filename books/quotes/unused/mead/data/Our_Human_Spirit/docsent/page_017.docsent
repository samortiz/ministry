   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF MAN AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 2:11 says that only the spirit of man knows the things of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people who are highly educated don't know what they are, who they are, where they are, or where they are going.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Only the spirit of man knows the things of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have to go to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you have some problem with your husband, you have to go to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you have some problem with your wife, go to the spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then you will know!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The spirit of man knows!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your spirit knows!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you are not clear about what you have to do with your wife, your husband, your children, or your brothers, go to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you don't know how to deal with your brothers in the Lord, go to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you don't know what to do with the church problems, with a church matter, go to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The spirit of man knows because it is the reality of man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Also, the Spirit of God reveals the things of God, and the situation, the condition of man, to man in his spirit 1 Cor 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So if we are going to know the things of man and the things of God, we have to come to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is here that we know the things of man, and it is here that we see the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all have to come to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we are persons in the spirit, spiritual men and not soulish men.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The soulish man receives not the things of the Spirit of God 1 Cor 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The soulish man is a man governed by his mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we turn to the spirit and when we stay in the spirit we become spiritual men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THREE KINDS OF PERSONS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1 Corinthians 2:13-16 and 3:1-3 there are three kinds of persons: spiritual, soulish, and fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The soulish person is one who lives according to his mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He doesn't know or care for his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He just lives, works, and walks according to his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fleshy person is one that walks and lives according to the lust of the fallen body, the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A fleshy person so easily criticizes, condemns, and scorns other people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Another person may be so nice, always careful, full of consideration, and caring for others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if I were so poor, so bad, and so ugly, this nice person wouldn't say a bad word about me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet this nice person may still be a soulish man because he may not even know that he has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He may be working on his Ph.D. in sociology, and learning how to be humane by exercising his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, a spiritual man is one that walks not according to the flesh, nor according to anything of the soul, but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now he is a spiritual man, so he has the spiritual discernment; he can know the spiritual things and he can even know all the things of man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A spiritual man is a wise man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The more you live in the spirit, the more you have the wise discernment of all things, even the things of God.</S>
