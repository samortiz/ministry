<p>The full-time training is the top and strictest teaching. It is a regulation. We Christians who want to serve the Lord need this kind of teaching, this kind of training, this kind of regulation. In the training, you are restricted. It is as if you are put into a box. Of course, this box is not a coffin. I once went to visit a certain locality, and the brothers there put me into an apartment with a small shower. When I was taking a shower, it was very difficult for me to move around freely. I had been used to taking a shower in a larger area, without hitting any of the four walls. But that small shower regulated me. It was a small box that restricted me. I could not be so free or loose with my actions. This is an example of being restricted and regulated from being too free, too loose. Such restriction and regulation helps you to grow.<p>Now you have dedicated yourself to being full-time. You are not going to do a business or a job; you are going to carry out a heavenly commission, a divine commission, the commission of the King. The royal family in Great Britain has to train a king or a queen from the time of his or her youth. Without such training, one could never be a king. He would not be qualified to be a king. You do not need any training to be a hippie or a loose person. But to be a king, you need the top training, and the top training is the strictest regulation to help you grow.<p>We Christians must be regulated. When I was teaching the thirty items of human character, some so-called spiritual people told me that I was teaching something which contradicted my ministry. They said that I always ministered life to people but that now I was teaching people about human character, which was building up human effort. But they did not understand the proper experience of the growth in life. The growth in life, our human being‘s growth in the divine life, needs regulation. Every regulation results in a certain character trait.<p>The first trait of a proper character according to my learning is genuineness. You must be genuine, real, true. Our human life is neither real nor true. It is false and vain. By our natural life we are vain, empty, and untrue. How can we be genuine? How can we be true? How can we be real? By the growth of the divine life. The more we grow in the divine life, the more we become genuine. Only the growth of the divine life in you will swallow up all of your falsehood and vanity to make you so real, genuine, and true. Another trait of a proper character is to be exact. How can we be exact? We need to grow in the divine life, and this growth needs the regulation.<p>Let me illustrate in this way. If four brothers would always be with you, you would be regulated on four sides every day. In the full-time training, you are surrounded by people and you have assigned roommates. Deep within your being, however, you would like to stay in a room by yourself. You do not like anyone to stay and sleep in one room with you. You might say, “I even don’t like a room just for two. I want a room for me alone.” All that you care about is “me”—me the first; me the second; me the third; me the last; me forever. You like to be free. To be free means not to be regulated. You may not like to be regulated by anybody. But when you are not regulated, you are through with the growth.<p>To put you in the training is to put you in an environment for your growth. The training is the best environment for you to grow. I encourage all of you to remain here for a full term of four months. Do not quit. Do not ask for a leave. Stay to the end. To the end means to the termination. You have to be here to be terminated. Then you will go back with a lot of growth. Sisters, you will greatly surprise your mother when you go back. She will be shocked at your growth. This is not according to some philosophical thinking. This is fully revealed in the Bible. Life grows by regulation.<p>Everybody likes marriage. But to some extent, eventually everybody hates marriage. Whether you like marriage or you hate marriage, it is God’s ordination. Marriage is merely, purely, and thoroughly a matter of regulation. To get married is to get into regulation. No one can regulate a brother as much as his wife can, and no one can regulate a sister as much as her husband can. Many people in the world cannot suffer this kind of regulation, so they quit. They either separate from each other or they get a divorce. They would not take the yoke ordained by God. Each dear wife and husband is a lovely yoke. Every day the husband is a yoke to his wife, and the wife is a yoke to her husband. This is ordained by God. A family is also a great factor of troubles. All these troubles come to regulate you. If you submit yourself to this regulation, this will help you to grow. The regulation of the family helps you to grow in the divine life.<p>The divine life does not grow in an easy environment. It grows only in a hard, troublesome, difficult environment. The full-time training is a troublesome factor. All the lessons assigned to you and all the teachers will be troublesome. In the first few days you may love the lessons and the teachers. But after a while you may begin to hate the training with all the classes, regulations, lessons, and teachers. This is a clear word to let you know that the full-time training is not a utopia. The training will be like the small shower to which I referred. The whole training will be a narrow shower to narrow you down. This will help you to grow.
