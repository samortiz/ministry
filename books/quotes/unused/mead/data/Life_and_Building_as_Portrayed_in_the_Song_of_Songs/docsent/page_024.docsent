   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A WILL OF SUBMISSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we come to chapter four, which is a continuation of chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the question was first asked about the seeking one coming out of the wilderness, the answer did not come from the Lord Himself, but from someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then in chapter four, the Lord gives His answer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead" 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord speaks of her beauty as still being in her eyes, but now something is added.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Her doves' eyes are within her locks.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that we all know what locks are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is hair that is curled and put together in a row.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Her hair is not left in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Her beauty is not only in her eyes, but in her eyes within the locks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If our hair is loose, there is no way to have locks.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The hair must be dealt with in a certain way in order to have the locks.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this verse, I really appreciate the punctuation of the King James Version.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After locks, there is a colon, which means "as follows."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So the following part of the verse explains what her hair is like.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is like a flock of goats that appears from mount Gilead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must realize that this is poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is easy to understand if you have ever seen a flock of goats on a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I saw such a sight both in Scotland and in New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It does not say that the goats are scattered over the mountain, but that they are flocked together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the poetic picture of the hair of the seeking one after becoming the crown.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Her hair has been dealt with to become locks, which appear like a flock of goats on a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have already seen that the eyes signify spiritual insight; this was the first change in the seeking one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What then does the hair signify?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hair in the Bible always indicates something of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All her scattered wills have been gathered together into rows to appear as a flock of goats on a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A flock of goats standing on a mountain presents a picture of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of the goats are standing on a lower part of the mountain, and some are standing on a higher part.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If they were standing on a flat plain, there would be no impression of submission, but for them to be standing on a mountain presents a picture of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The goats are not scattered, but gathered; they are not on the plain, but on the mountainside, giving a picture of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that by the improvement from a horse to a palanquin, all the wills of the seeking one have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have been subdued and gathered together to be made into rows full of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Chapter four is a continuation of chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It tells us the secret of how the seeking one made such an improvement: her will was subdued and dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By the time she was the moving vessel of Christ, all her wills had been dealt with and gathered together to present a picture of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SUBDUING OF THE WILL</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now we understand what the Lord means when He says, "Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Her beauty is now not only in her insight, but in the insight within her locks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Her beauty is seen in her changed concepts within her subdued will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is not only the renewing of her mind, but also the subduing of her will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is exceedingly fair and comely to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Formerly, she had only the beauty of the renewing of her mind, but now she also has the beauty of the subduing of her will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times in the past forty years I have come back to the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have had many experiences in this book, and I have come to realize that it speaks not only of love, but also of the subduing of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To have complete, adequate, and thorough transformation, there must be the subduing of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The more our will is subdued, the more we will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Many of us love the Lord, but we still hold on to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our concept has been changed, and our mind has been renewed, but our will needs subduing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of us are so stubborn not only the brothers, but also the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The problem is not with our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I believe that in the past few months, the Lord has heard many voices saying, "Lord Jesus, I love You!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in answer to these voices, I believe the Lord would say, "Yes, I know that you love Me, but what about your will?"</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have our concept changed is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must go on to have our will subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we have already mentioned, the discrepancy between the seeking one and the Lord in chapter two was due entirely to her strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord asked her to rise up and come away with Him, but she said that she was not ready.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other words, she was telling the Lord that it was not a matter of His will, but her will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Her will was so strong that she would allow the Lord to go away only if He came back when she needed Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She was even giving orders to the Lord by her strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, the Lord spent a long time dealing with her in the wilderness of the stubborn will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When our will is not subdued, it simply becomes a wilderness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The real entering into the good land is a full subduing of our will.</S>
