   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. PAUL S SUFFERING FOR THE GOSPEL A. In Bonds</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Paul wrote to the Philippians, he was suffering for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1:7, 13, 14 and 17 he refers to his bonds, that is, his imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates clearly that the book of Philippians was written from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although Paul was a prisoner, his prison became a house of wine, a banqueting house, for there Paul was enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 7, in which Paul speaks of partaking of grace, indicates this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul was in bonds, but he was enjoying grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse indicates clearly and strongly that for Paul prison was a place of feasting and not merely of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>B. Due to the Defense</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>and Confirmation of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In particular Paul s imprisonment was due to the defense and confirmation of the gospel 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Defending the Gospel on the Negative Side</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>from Perverting and Distorting Heresies</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The defense of the gospel is related, on the negative side, to the perverting and distorting heresies, like Judaism dealt with in Galatians and Gnosticism dealt with in Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Judaism was perverting the gospel, whereas Gnosticism and Greek philosophy were distorting it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul defended the gospel against all heretical perversion and distortion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Consider his experience with Peter at Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Peter had received the vision concerning the Gentiles in Acts 10, he withdrew from eating with the Gentile believers in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this matter, Peter did not stand for the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the contrary, he perverted this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, Paul withstood Peter to his face and rebuked him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In defending the gospel against perversion and distortion, Paul was unique.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to the record of the New Testament, he was the one who stood the strongest against anything that perverted and distorted the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the reason for much of his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, the grace he enjoyed surpassed these sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Confirming the Gospel on the Positive Side</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>with All the Revelation of God s Mysteries</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>concerning Christ and the Church</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The confirmation of the gospel is related, on the positive side, to all the revelations of God s mysteries concerning Christ and the church as unveiled in Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the writings of Paul, the two great mysteries Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ are unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>No other apostle unveiled these mysteries as adequately as Paul did.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To be sure, his teaching and preaching were a confirmation of the gospel and of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In contrast to Paul, who was absolute for the defense and confirmation of the gospel, many preachers of the gospel today are wishy-washy in this regard.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They seem to have no backbone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead of dealing with the major points of God s economy, certain of these preachers simply deliver sugar-coated messages to make others happy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we in the Lord s recovery must defend the gospel and confirm it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the one hand, we must defend the gospel against teachings which are perverting and distorting it; on the other hand, we must confirm it by pointing out the goal of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. For the Advancement of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1:12 Paul says, Now I want you to know, brothers, that the things concerning me have turned out rather to the advancement of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Greek word rendered advancement refers to the advancement made by pioneers who cut the way before an army to further its march.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul s sufferings made such an advancement for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul was a pioneer cutting the way so that the church as the army of God could march on.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He knew that his sufferings were preparing the way, even the highway, for the advancement of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Apart from such sufferings, there would not have been this advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even we today are marching on the way cut by Paul in his sufferings for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Throughout the centuries, much debris has been thrown on the highway to block the way cut by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today there is no need for us to cut another highway, but there is the need to clear the one cut by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even this causes enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Certain of today s religionists do not want us to clear away the debris and obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But we have been commissioned by the Lord to clear the way so that the church may advance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We expect that if the young people are faithful to the Lord, they will be able to march forward on a clear highway.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For many years we have been helping to clear the way, and we trust that the young generation in the Lord s recovery will march on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We expect that, sooner or later, the Lord s people will travel on the way that is being cleared for them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although many are not willing to take this way at present, some are using our materials and have begun to talk about the human spirit and the local churches.</S>
