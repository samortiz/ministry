   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Romans were a belligerent nation and their emperor a tyrant.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How did Jesus answer them?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said, "Render then the things that are Caesar's to Caesar and the things that are God's to God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What He meant was that He was not interested in politics.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He swept all worldly things aside.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He had wanted to overturn the rule of Rome, it would not have been difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But His eyes were not on those things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He emphasized only one thing to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said that He is the good Shepherd who left ninety-nine in the fold and went to seek for one lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is like a woman who has ten pieces of silver but loses one.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>PAUL'S CONCERN</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then let us turn to His apostle Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What kind of work did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Never once did he try to change the social order.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had no concern for the political issues of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In those days Rome ruled over its empire with an iron fist.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>History tells us that they had an inhuman institution of slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Not only was it lawful to trade human beings publicly, but they could also beat or even crucify the slaves at will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What did Paul command the Christians to do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He said that the slaves should be obedient to their masters, and not only to the good ones, but to the ill-disposed and cruel ones as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Did Paul lack the courage to stand up against the slave system?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All who have read Paul's letters would agree that if there was a brave person in this world other than Jesus of Nazareth, it had to be Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>SOLUTION TO ALL PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today God is saving individual men.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they are saved, many other problems will be solved spontaneously and naturally.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Among the Christians, there is no difference between the Jews and Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Neither is there the distinction between free men and slaves, or a discrimination between the rich and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even deep-rooted enmities between races and nations are dissolved among them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Jews have the strongest national pride.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They consider the Gentiles to be dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are the most segregated people.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But immediately after they come to the Lord, they are brought together with Christians of other cultures.</S>
