   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Problem of the Thought of Being a Hero</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with the Middle-aged Ones</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is also a problem with the middle-aged ones.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this elders' meeting, I have been prepared by the Lord to say something very practical to the three age groups the young people, the middle-aged brothers, and the old brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the trouble with the middle-aged brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A certain brother may have come into the church life when he was twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now that he is forty years old, he praises the Lord for His mercy in keeping him in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is thankful to the Lord for His ministry by which he has been nourished, educated, perfected, and equipped.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now he has the attitude that he knows something and can do something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then what is the trouble?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He can use anything according to your age to get you as his prey.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The middle-aged brothers, after staying in the Lord's recovery about eighteen to twenty years, may consider themselves as heroes in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They feel that the recovery cannot be short of them.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because I have passed through the Lord's recovery as a young and middle-aged person, I understand these problems.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I dropped my job in 1933 so that I could serve the Lord with all of my time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was humble, because I did not know much about life, the Spirit, Christ, or the church as the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, by that time I had acquired much knowledge about the types and prophecies in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I knew that Christ was my Savior, but I never knew that He was God's centrality and universality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brother Nee was only two years older than I. Sister Faith Chang observed my relationship with him and testified that I was to Brother Nee just like a son to a father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After ten years of being with Brother Nee, from 1933 to 1943, I learned a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 1943, after I had been somewhat perfected and equipped, I became very sick.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That was actually the mercy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Japanese put me into prison for one month.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After I came out of prison, I got tuberculosis and nearly died.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord in His mercy put me into this sickness for two and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I learned a lot in that time.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During that time, I saw the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This took place when I was forty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1944 I left Chefoo, my hometown.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Since then up to now, I have not returned there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The lesson that I have learned with the middle-aged brothers is their thinking that they may be the hero, that they may be somebody in the recovery, and that the young ones should listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you think this way, sooner or later, a day will come when the crouching enemy will take you as his prey.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I thank the Lord that He delivered me out of that snare.</S>
