        <h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING &ldquo;COME AND GO&rdquo;<br />
AND HAVING THE WORK<br />
OF GOLD, SILVER, AND PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
<p>In 1949 I left mainland China and came to Taiwan to begin the Lord&rsquo;s work in Taipei, but I was not hired by the church in Taipei. Although I was sent by the work to Taiwan, I was not carrying out a religious enterprise or establishing an organization or movement. I can testify that the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s work is His doing.</p>
<p>Concerning the land on which hall one in Taipei is built, the front half was a gift to the church from two Chinese brothers, who had been living overseas and had returned to Taiwan and saw the Lord&rsquo;s need. We built a small meeting hall on that piece of land. On August 1, 1949, we held our first conference there to officially begin the Lord&rsquo;s work. Under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, the number of believers kept increasing until the meeting hall was no longer adequate for our use. Then the Lord allowed us to purchase the adjacent piece of land at a low price. Thus, we tore down the existing small meeting hall and built a larger one. Once, when we were preaching the gospel in Taipei, some people had to sit on benches in the empty lot across from the meeting hall in order to hear the gospel, because there was not sufficient space in the hall. We later built a workers&rsquo; house on that empty lot. Years later, the government planned to expand the roads in Taipei, so we returned that piece of land to the government. Everything was according to the Lord&rsquo;s good pleasure. We are now going to build a large meeting hall, and the Lord has provided us with a sum of money.</p>
<p>We must remember that in our work we do not have an organization; rather, we live in the principle of &ldquo;come and go,&rdquo; that is, the principle of coming to the Lord and then going after receiving a burden from the Lord. Only this kind of work is worthwhile. This is neither a movement nor an organization. Any work that is a movement or an organization is wood, grass, and stubble; only the work of coming and going can produce gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:12).</p>
<p>We come to the Lord, and then we go filled with the Lord&rsquo;s grace so that we may bring this grace, which is the Lord Himself, to people. The issue of such a work is gold, silver, and precious stones. My spirit is excited and revived to see that so many saints are in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, because the saints are my joy (1 Thes. 2:19). Those who are in the church life can testify that what they have gained is the Lord Himself. They have received salvation and the Lord&rsquo;s love, grace, life, and light, and they have also received the Lord Himself. This is gold, silver, and precious stones, which will last for eternity.</p>
<p>Our coming to Taiwan for the Lord&rsquo;s work was in the principle of coming and going. We did not carry out the work as a movement or as an organization. In a co-workers&rsquo; meeting, Brother Watchman Nee decided that I should go to Taiwan. I went forth in faith and did not receive support from anyone. I had a family of ten plus two helpers whom I could not dismiss, and I had only three hundred dollars in my hand. Outwardly, we came to Taiwan empty-handed; inwardly, however, we came filled with Christ to share with all the people. I believe that the saints can testify that in the church we are receiving gold, silver, and precious stones.</p>
<p>Let me repeat, we do not have an organization, an evangelistic campaign, or a mission, nor do we promote any movement. We share with others the grace that we have received through coming and going. We all should be coming and going. We come to the Lord to be graced, enlightened, dealt with, purified, emptied, and filled with Him so that we may be sent forth by the Lord, and we go with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GREAT GOING FOR FIVE ASPECTS OF THE NEED<br />
IN THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the Lord&rsquo;s move on the earth. Therefore, we move according to the Lord. We do not want to initiate any movement. If there is a movement, there is an organization, for these two are inseparable. We have abandoned every religious organization and movement. We only want to come and go, that is, to come to the Lord daily and to go after receiving a burden from Him. We will fellowship concerning five aspects of the need in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This fellowship is concerning great goings, not small goings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Raising Up the Young Working Saints<br />
to Continue the Eldership</h2>
<p>In the last two decades the Lord has raised up over sixty local churches in Taiwan. Some of these churches are stronger, and some are weaker, still needing help from the co-workers. The stronger churches still have shortages. For example, the church in Taipei has more than twelve elders who were appointed over twenty years ago. Some of these elders were a little over thirty years old when they were appointed but are now over sixty years old. Because the elders in Taipei are older and have such a history, the church in Taipei has a firm foundation. However, when the leading ones get older, they are not as living and fresh. Therefore, several years ago the Lord&rsquo;s leading to the churches was for a turning of the age. The goal was to replace the elders who were over sixty years old in all the stronger churches with the younger generation. This is not saying that the older elders are not qualified or have not done a good job, but if the father in a big family has worked hard since his youth, he should be discharged of his burden when he becomes old so that the second generation can pick up the burden. Then the entire family will have a future and will have hope. If the son is thirty years old and the seventy-year-old father is still busy, the son has no choice but to be a bystander, who cannot render any help but rather becomes sarcastic when he disagrees with the situation. Such a family has no future. The aged father should rest and let his young son take over the responsibility. This example may be inadequate, but it is clear. I hope that we can understand the meaning.</p>
<p>Many of the stronger churches in Taiwan have a history of over twenty-five years, and most of the elders in these churches are over sixty years of age. These brothers have served as elders for over twenty years. As such, they should be allowed to rest. However, I am not saying that they should no longer be concerned for the church. They should be concerned for the church and pray for the church, like elderly fathers who stand behind the younger generation to support and supply the family. The younger generation should rise up to meet the present need. The stronger churches in Taiwan need some strong younger ones who are raised up by the Lord to carry on the eldership.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
