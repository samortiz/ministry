   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OFFENDING GOD'S TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BRINGING IN HIS DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God often disciplines His children for the purpose of vindicating Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God wants to let men, as well as the devil, know that He has no part in a certain matter, that it is something done by man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If man cannot maintain God's testimony, He has to step forward to maintain it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God will maintain His testimony, even if man cannot; He will maintain it by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a man does not maintain God's testimony, he will suffer God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many kinds of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some sins are related to ourselves alone; God pays less attention to them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if anything that is related to God offends Him, He will step forward and immediately discipline us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has to immediately declare that He has nothing to do with the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we have to be very careful before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is wrong to commit any sin in general, but in particular, we should not commit the sin of offending the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In general we have to ask God in fear and trembling to keep us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In particular we have to ask Him to keep us from the sin of offending the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to learn to know God and learn to not offend Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever God declares Himself as God, He will not compromise nor implicate Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man can fail, but he can never offend God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can look at the stories of many men in the Old Testament, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and David.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were chosen by God, and God delighted in them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their histories also show failures and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet God judged them only briefly, and then He dropped the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you ever wondered why God behaved in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was because the wrong things they committed did not offend God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever God's testimony is offended, the consequence is grave and terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not a distinction between the Old Testament and the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a distinction between offending the testimony and honoring the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a tremendous thing, a terrible thing, to offend God's testimony; God will not allow us to get by.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must learn to fear God in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 12:10 says, "For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God disciplines us for our profit, which is our participation in His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God wants us to partake of His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever God disciplines, He disciplines for the purpose of vindicating Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Have you ever realized that Satan's mouth is stopped whenever God disciplines us?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once God disciplines us, Satan has nothing more to say; he cannot accuse us any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The discipline from God is for the purpose of maintaining Himself; it maintains His own holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a consequence, the enemy sees that God has no part in a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When you are under discipline, the first thing you should pray for is God's vindication, not your deliverance from the discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever you are disciplined, you have to tell the brothers and sisters that you were disciplined because you offended God in a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It may be a simple word, but it will testify to the fact that God has no share in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some brothers and sisters have clearly done something wrong and experienced God's discipline, yet they continue to cry because the discipline is too severe and because they are in trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet they should not cry about this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's discipline is for the purpose of absolving Himself in a matter; it is for the purpose of vindicating His name.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His name is upon you, and if you are not careful, you will implicate Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, He has to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you are disciplined, you should bow down and worship the Lord, saying, "I will gladly accept this discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I will gladly stand in this position.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I will gladly let the devil, the church, and the world know that God has no share in this matter and that the wrong is all on my part."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more you submit to His disciplining hand and the more you vindicate God, the easier it will be for you to go through the discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But the more you try to run from the discipline and the more you struggle, the more you will not get away.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This matter has a great deal to do with God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have to learn to know God in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This will deliver us from many cumbersome things.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At the same time, we must allow God to be glorified through our failures.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do well and glorify God, we should thank God's grace for it.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do not do well, we should still glorify God in the things which He uses to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May the blood cover us in saying these words and may the blood cover all those who read these words.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is a sober matter, and we should pay much attention to it.</S>
