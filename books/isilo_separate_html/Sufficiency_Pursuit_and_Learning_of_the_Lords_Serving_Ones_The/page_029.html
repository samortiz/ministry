<p>In addition to being limited in our education, our mind is also improper. The majority of our problems are due to our fallen mind. Few people have a proper mind. Even psychologists say that most people have a slight mental problem. In spite of this, we need to use our mind. The Bible speaks of the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2). Our fallen mind is not proper; hence, it needs to be renewed. When some believers read the Bible, their mind travels everywhere without restraint. The kind of Bible that we have is determined by our person. This concerns the state of our mind. The kind of person we are determines the kind of mind we have, and the kind of mind we have determines the kind of Bible we read. If we desire to use our spirit and touch the Spirit in the Bible, we must look to the Lord for His mercy so that we would have a proper mind. Without a proper mind, we cannot receive proper inspiration; rather, we will receive strange inspiration.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Needing a Focused Mind</h2>
<p>Third, our mind needs to be focused, not scattered. A scattered and disturbed mind will prevent us from receiving inspiration. No one has a mind that is absolutely focused and undisturbed. However, our experience testifies that when we sit down to read the Bible, we have difficulty staying focused. That is the time when our mind travels from one place to another place. One minute it is set on one thing and the next minute it is set on something else. Although our eyes are looking at the Bible, our mind is somewhere else and is not focused on the words that we are reading. How can we receive inspiration under such circumstances? And how can we touch the Spirit? We must learn to focus our mind and to control our thoughts.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Needing a Clear Mind</h2>
<p>Fourth, our mind should be clear. Some saints have a mind that is proper but not clear; their mind is often confused. Some saints begin to daydream the moment they open the Bible, whereas others do not know what they read. For example, a brother may read about the Ark, but when he is asked about the dimensions of the Ark, he will speak about the bronze altar. When he is asked about the bronze altar, his response is related to the incense altar. Not many people have a clear mind. Most believers do not know the difference between Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. They think that these four books are more or less the same. This indicates that they do not have a clear mind.</p>
<p>In the New Testament Peter was often mentioned first among the apostles (Matt. 10:2; Mark 3:16; Luke 6:14; Acts 1:13). However, in Galatians James was mentioned first (2:9). If we read the Bible hastily without some consideration, we will miss this kind of detail. It is not so easy to find a believer who has a proper and clear mind. Some believers are very smart, but their mind is not proper. Some believers are well-behaved, but their mind is dull, not clear. Some believers do not have a proper or sharp mind because it has been damaged; hence, their thoughts wander and are not focused. These situations are the result of Satan&rsquo;s work.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Spending Time to Study the Bible</h2>
<p>The limitations related to our mind include not being educated, proper, focused, or clear. These problems hinder us from touching the Spirit when we read the Bible. In order to touch the Spirit, we must deal with these problems. We must learn the meaning of the words used in the Bible. We must set aside some time every day to contact God through reading the Bible, and we must spend sufficient time to study the Bible. We should not waste our time with idle talk, newspapers, or television. We must save our energy and our time in order to focus them on God and the Bible. We should spend three months to study Genesis and another three months to study Exodus. It would be good to study the first few books of the Bible in this way. Then we can spend time to study Joshua, the Kings, the Chronicles, and Psalms. This is not a waste of effort. To study the Bible thoroughly can be compared to purchasing produce and preparing meals. Then when we need to eat, the food we need will be prepared.</p>
<p>Some saints have not prepared anything, so when they come to the Bible, they have nothing to eat. When they come to Exodus 25 concerning the Ark, they do not understand it. They do not understand the meaning of acacia wood being overlaid with gold. This is indeed the case with some saints. As a result, they do not have much interest in reading the Bible. If we cannot understand the Bible, it is a loss to us.</p>
<p>We must spend time to study God&rsquo;s Word book by book. I hope that this message will reach all the churches and that all the saints will rise up to read, study, and understand God&rsquo;s Word. However, it is not enough to study the Bible; we must also eat every day. We must spend time to touch and contact God&rsquo;s Word every day. Our heart and our mind must be exercised so that we may understand the words and the allegories. Then it will be easy for our spirit to touch the Spirit. The apostle Paul was such a person. He was educated, and his mind was focused, proper, and clear. Regardless of which book in the Old Testament that he read, he was inspired, and his spirit touched the Spirit. Since his heart was dealt with and his mind was trained, it was easy for him to touch the Spirit in the Bible.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
