Whether one emphasizes the first aspect or the second, any bias will result in problems and sickness to our Christian life
Whether it is the first or the second part, nothing is possible apart from God, and nothing will be accomplished apart from God
We are sinful and have the Adamic life in us; therefore, we must first be dealt with, before God can give us a new life
Sin is a fact which cannot be overturned, and death is the inevitable result of sin; it is also something which cannot be overturned
Because God put us into Christ, the cross is no longer just His cross, but a cross in which all those who are in Him have a part
It would not matter how holy and lovely Jesus of Nazareth was; there would be no way for us to receive Him, because He would only be a man
When we receive the Holy Spirit, we receive Christ; in the same way, when we receive the Son, we receive the Father
When men in the past saw the Father, they saw the Son; in the same way, when men know the Spirit today, they know the Son
All those who have received the Lord Jesus, whether they are clear or not, have received this experience from God
Wisdom is the subject, and righteousness, sanctification, and redemption are the explanation of how Christ becomes our wisdom
God has not given us Christ so that He could just die for us on the cross; He has given Christ to us to be our life
Originally, we react to all the demands that are outside of us by exercising our own life; we act according to our own life
It is not a matter of the Lord Jesus giving us commands, suggestions, or teachings and then us carrying them out
After understanding the meaning of Christ being our life, we now come to the question of Christ becoming our wisdom from God
It does not say that we understand and know how to speak or act, even though we were once foolish, because God has given us wisdom
After we see the meaning of Aaron becoming the mouth of Moses, we see the meaning of Christ becoming wisdom to us from God
God does not change a foolish man into a wise man; rather, He causes Christ to become wisdom to the foolish man
God has not changed foolish men into wise; rather, He has made Christ our wisdom; Christ has become wisdom to us from God
You may try this way and that way in vain; your little mind may be exhausted, yet you still cannot come up with a solution
Brothers and sisters, if we know what it means for Christ to 'become,' we can live a proper life before the Lord
We have previously said that Christ becoming our wisdom means three things: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
Brothers and sisters, if we are not clear about righteousness, we cannot go on in peace; we will always have trouble
Some brothers and sisters think that if their behavior is good and they do well from morning to evening, they have righteousness that day
When God opens our eyes, we will see that our righteousness before God has nothing to do with our conduct; it is something else
Our conduct is not blameless, but praise the Lord, our righteousness is blameless because our righteousness is Christ
We have to realize that while our conduct can improve again and again, our righteousness before God cannot improve anymore
The means by which we can come to God today is the same means by which we can come to Him ten or twenty years from now
If a man does not have the revelation to see that Christ is his righteousness, he will not be able to come boldly before God
If he sees that his righteousness is a person, that his righteousness is Christ, he will be bold in approaching God
God must show us that Christ does not come to help us to become holy; He does not give us the strength to be sanctified
Brothers and sisters, if we say that sanctification is a thing, God's Word will tell us that Christ is that thing
God has not given us Christ as a power so that we can produce humility; God has given us Christ to be our humility
There is only one life, but because the demands outside of us are different, there are different kinds of responses
The many virtues of Christians are not their own behavior, but the reflections of Christ and the manifestations of Christ
Brother Chow's love, Sister Hu's meekness, and Sister Liu's humility are not different virtues; they are Christ
Once we realize this we will lift up our head to the Lord and say I have tried in the past to be a Christian by myself
When a man comes to God through Christ God will no longer condemn him because Christ has satisfied Gods righteous requirement on mans behalf
Christ as our redemption within not only delivers us from the law of sin in our members , but has become life to our body
For we who are alive are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh
Verse 10 says that the life of Jesus is manifested in our body while verse 11 says that the life of Jesus is manifested in our mortal bodies
With many believers, the life of Jesus may be manifested in their body, but may not be manifested in their mortal body
They feel the Lord's presence and manifest the Lord's virtues in their expression, their voice, and their actions
For our mortal body to be made alive does not mean that the nature of the body is changed or that we become immortal
When a Christian dies, he is not like a piece of copper buried in the ground, but like a grain of wheat sown into the earth
Christ is his redemption, and he will inherit a resurrected body which is incorruptible, glorious, strong, and spiritual
There was a young girl who once asked a preacher, 'Does it not take a great effort for a Christian to be raptured away'?
After Adam sinned, God immediately guarded the way of the tree of life with the cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way
He did this because if Adam had eaten the fruit of the tree of life, he would have bonded an indissoluble relationship with God
Thank God that our relationship with Christ is a relationship which Adam did not have; it is an indissoluble relationship
May the Lord open our eyes to see that God has put us into Christ and made Christ our wisdom: righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
May the Lord deliver us from foolishness and darkness so that we realize that there is no matter or thing in the spiritual realm
