<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The intrinsic essence of the church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The divine life, which generates the church&mdash; 1 John 1:2; 5:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>By the regeneration of the Spirit in the believers&rsquo; spirit&mdash;John 3:3, 5-6.</li>
		<li>Making them the children of God as the bride of Christ, who is the Bridegroom, for His increase, as typified by Eve as the counterpart to Adam&mdash;John 1:12-13; 3:29-30; Gen. 2:21-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through the release of the divine life by Christ as the one grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying there for His multiplication&mdash;John 12:24.</li>
	<li>Through the impartation of the divine life by Christ as the firstborn Son of God in His resurrection, that God may have many sons as the many brothers of Christ&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:11-12.</li>
	<li>The many brothers of Christ being His many branches grafted into Him, the true vine in the universe, to bear much fruit for His enlargement in His spreading, that they might express the Triune God as His organism&mdash;John 15:1, 5, 16, 8.</li>
	<li>This organism of the Triune God being the organic Body of Christ, constituted with His many brothers as the many members of His organic Body&mdash; Eph. 1:22-23; Rom. 12:5.</li>

<li>The organic existence of the church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Existing in the universe as the one universal church of God for His universal expression, the fullness of God&mdash;1 Cor. 10:32; 12:28; Eph. 3:19b.</li>
	<li>Spreading in many localities on the earth as many local churches to be His local expressions&mdash;Rev. 1:4a, 11.</li>

FOR ITS ORGANIC EXISTENCE</h2>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for this Thanksgiving weekend conference. May this conference be a real thanksgiving from us to You. Lord, cover us with Your precious blood. How much we need Your blood and Your anointing, the rich anointing with all the unsearchable riches of the Triune God. Lord, we thank You for the past. Thank You for the present. We even thank You for the coming days. Lord, be with us. We need Your presence. Lord, anoint the whole meeting. Anoint every attendant. Lord, open the heavens and give us a clear sky that we may have a clear view under Your oracle. Take away all the veils, take away all the clouds, and give us Your own revelation. We want to see something. We want not only to hear, but also to see. Lord Jesus, we love You, and we want to see You in this meeting. We want to be touched by You. Touch us, Lord. Touch each one of us, and give to each one of us the particular word that we need. Lord, we thank You again that You are so sovereign. You are on the throne. We worship You, and we give You all the glory, yet we still remember Your enemy. Lord, we are fighting against him. We are always in the battle. Lord, fight the battle for us. Put him aside, and shame him. May all the glory be to You. Lord, may all the blessings be bestowed upon us. Thank You for the church. Thank You for Your oracle today. Speak in our speaking. Lord, we believe You are one with us, one spirit with us, and we believe we are one spirit with You. Thank You for this oneness. We pray in Your mighty name. Amen.</p>
<p>My burden in these messages concerns five intrinsic things. Four concern the church, and one concerns the winds of teaching. The first four intrinsic things of the church are: the intrinsic essence of the church for its organic existence; the intrinsic growth of the church for its organic increase; the intrinsic building up of the church for its organic function; and the intrinsic fellowship of the churches for their organic relationship. The intrinsic essence, the intrinsic growth, the intrinsic building up, and the intrinsic fellowship are all very positive. The last intrinsic factor of the winds of teaching for their evil purpose is a negative item.</p>
