   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Inflated Numbers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When many people speak, inflated numbers are quoted.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No church in Shanghai has a sitting capacity of five thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Any preacher with some training will know the capacity of a hall with just one look.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, many reports about revival meetings have described the attendance at ten or even twenty thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if every person stood on the head of another, there would still not be enough room for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet these are words from Christian workers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is exaggeration!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of exaggeration is lying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We magnify others' mistakes and minimize our own.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We exaggerate others' errors and try the best to reduce our own.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is lying as well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Conscientiously Learning to Be an Honest Person</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today I cannot say that all of God's children become honest after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they set their minds before the Lord to learn these lessons for five years, perhaps they will be an honest person by the end of the five years.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Allow me to say a strong word: A person must continually reject all kinds of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever you find yourself speaking something inaccurately, you have to repudiate it relentlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you practice this, perhaps you will become an honest person after three or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You cannot expect a person who is careless and capricious about his speaking to become an honest person overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lies and inaccuracies are common maladies among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everyone in this world follows Satan and everyone lies.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people are slow, while others are smart, but everyone lies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some lie without skill while others lie with skill, but everyone lies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to deal with the Lord constantly so that we are warned as soon as we lie or touch the spirit of lying.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How important it is to be honest, yet how unnatural it is to be honest!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our very nature is dishonest, and from the time we were born, we have lied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We like to speak according to our preference, but not according to truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A child must learn to do things step by step from the very beginning of his human life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As God's children, we also need to learn our lessons from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we become careless, we will lie and speak inaccurate words.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The problem of lying is a very common one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the darkest sin and the most common sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many people regard this as a light matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we have a problem with our speaking, two things will happen: First, the church will find itself filled with death, and Christians will find it impossible to walk in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, God cannot make us ministers of His word, and our usefulness will stop.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can still speak a little on the Bible, on truth, and on doctrine, and we can still give a speech, but we will not be able to serve as ministers of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to be a minister of God's word, one must be honest in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he is not honest, God cannot use him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May we all see the need to reject lies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not speak according to our own desire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should reject all lies completely.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not speak in a subjective way, but in an objective way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should speak according to facts, according to what we hear, and not according to how we feel.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If God's children practice this, a straight path will await them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>NO IDLE WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another type of words which should never come out of our mouth is idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Matthew 12:35-37 says, "The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before the Lord Jesus said this, He said, "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known" v. 33 . According to the context, the fruit does not refer to one's conduct, but to one's word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that a person's words are good if that person is good, and a person's words are evil if that person is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We know a person by the words he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are some who gossip day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They tell tales all the time about others and are full of slander, railing, criticism, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Their mouths are filled with all kinds of filthy, dirty, and evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is obvious that they are corrupt trees.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The problem among God's children today is that they cannot judge others by the words they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They cannot judge, because they are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord tells us that the good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By its fruit the tree is known.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If a brother spreads evil, critical, or sinful things all the time, we do not need to determine whether his words are true.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We can tell him that his act of spreading such things is itself an unclean matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We must realize that the words of God's children are the fruit of their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No one whose heart is holy will speak filthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No one whose heart is filled with love will speak hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>By its fruit the tree is known.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This does not mean that we can speak anything as long as it is true and factual.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sometimes it is not a matter of whether or not something is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Something may be a fact, a definite fact, yet it should not be a fruit of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It may be true, but we should not utter it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not a matter of truth, but a matter of idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The word may be true, but it is an idle word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I have just said that our speaking must be according to facts.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, not all facts need to be spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We cannot and we need not speak idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord said, "And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment" v. 36 . Idle words from a Christian's mouth will not be spoken once but twice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whatever is spoken carelessly today will be repeated again in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It will be repeated in full, sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When it is repeated the second time, we will be justified or condemned based on it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We will have to render an account on the judgment day for every idle word we have spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I hope that God's children will learn to fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We should learn to reject every inaccurate word and to speak accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We should never speak about things that do not concern us, and we should not say anything that reaps no benefit to others or to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>One can tell how much a person has been dealt with by the Lord by the words out of his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>No one who has been disciplined by God has an undisciplined mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A person who lies or who speaks idle and careless words is of little use to God; he is good only for the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have to learn this lesson from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Those who speak defiled words are defiled persons.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Those who speak corrupted words are corrupted in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The kind of words we speak reveals the kind of persons we are.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>By its fruit a tree is known.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>By our words we are known.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is important that we pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We know a brother by the way he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Today the church is filled with lies and idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>How strange it is that few children of God ever condemn them!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>No one among us has the right to speak any idle words.</S>
