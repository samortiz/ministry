<h1 class="title">JUSTIFIED BY FAITH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rom. 3:22a, 28, 30; 5:1</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The works of man fail
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The requirement of God&rsquo;s law is perfect.</li>
	<li>In contrast, the works of man are imperfect and defiled.</li>
	<li>Therefore no one can be justified according to his own works.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The redemption of Christ is sure
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The redemption of Christ is entirely according to the requirement of the law.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s redemption also satisfies the requirement of the law.</li>
	<li>Thus the redemption of Christ enables man to be justified by God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Justified through faith
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Since the works of law are not dependable, but the redemption of Christ is so dependable and sure, justification must not depend upon man&rsquo;s works, but upon the redemption of Christ.</li>
	<li>In order for man to depend on the redemption of Christ he must believe in Christ and His redemption; in other words, he must receive Christ and His redemption.</li>
	</ol></li>
