<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THE LEADING OF THE LIVING STAR<br />
IN ADDITION TO THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>As soon as the magi left Jerusalem for Bethlehem, the star appeared again (v. 9). Once we leave the realm of religion, we receive revelation. Micah 5:2 says that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, but this knowledge is not enough. The Bible says only that Christ would be born in Bethlehem, but there was more than one street in Bethlehem, and there was more than one home on each street. On which street and in which home was Christ to be born? If the magi had only the prophecy from the Bible, it would have been difficult for them to find Christ in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Hence, it is not enough for us just to study the Bible; however, we cannot be without the Bible, because the Bible is the Word of God. When we are confused and lose sight of the star, we need the Bible to guide us. I believe that if the magi had simply followed the leading of the star, instead of depending on their natural concept, they would have been brought to the baby Jesus. If they had not cared whether they were being led toward the east or the west, or whether they were going to Jerusalem, Bethlehem, or Nazareth, but had simply followed the star, they would have been brought step by step to Bethlehem and to the baby Jesus. It is a pity that they thought the King of the Jews should be born in Jerusalem and went there. When they went to Jerusalem, the star disappeared because they were in the wrong place. They needed the Bible to guide them. When we lose the guiding of the star, we need the Bible.</p>
<p>Knowing the Bible did not help the scribes and chief priests. It helped only those who were seeking the Lord. After receiving the words of the Bible, the magi left the religious center of Jerusalem and went to Bethlehem. As soon as they left Jerusalem, the star appeared to them and led them to Bethlehem and to the house where the Lord Jesus was. They did not need to ask whether the child was Jesus or why the King of the Jews would be born in a manger, because the star led them. As a result, they did not have any doubts. As soon as they saw the child, they fell down and worshipped Him, and opening their treasures, they offered gifts to Him (Matt. 2:11).</p>
<p>Some Christians teach that the Bible is complete and that we need only the Bible and nothing else. The Bible is indeed complete. However, to say that we need only the Bible and nothing else is not accurate. Our Bible must be living. If our Bible is not living, we cannot say that we need only the Bible and nothing else. Besides the Bible, we must have the living star. We need to see the living star in addition to knowing the Bible.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that the Bible is on earth, and the star is in heaven. Even today the star is still in heaven. This heavenly star is for those who have a seeking heart. As long as a person has a seeking heart, the heavenly star will appear to him so that he may know Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING REVELATION IN A DREAM</h2>
<p>After following the star and seeing Christ, the magi were divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod so that they would not be deceived by him: &ldquo;Because they had been divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed by another way to their country&rdquo; (v. 12). <em>Dream</em> in this verse does not refer to the ordinary dreams that people have. Some people have strange and weird dreams that are worthless and meaningless. The dream that the magi had was a trance, a kind of comprehension that is beyond reasoning, a vision that transcends natural concepts. It is a dream, and yet it is not a dream.</p>
<p>I have had at least one such experience. It was as clear as a scene before my eyes. I cannot say that it was a dream, nor can I say that it was not a dream. During China&rsquo;s War of Resistance against Japan, I was imprisoned by the Japanese military police in Chefoo, Shantung Province. After I was released, I was not permitted to leave home at will. While I was in prison, I suffered to the extent that even after I was released I still felt the fear and threat of the prison. I was released on a Thursday, and on the Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoon I attended the bread-breaking meeting. Prior to that day I had never fallen asleep in the bread-breaking meeting. However, that afternoon, as the cup was being passed, seemingly I fell asleep, but I did not sleep. I saw a dog coming toward me, but it shook its head and tail in shame and then walked away. I knew then that the Japanese police would seek me out again; however, I had peace within me. The Holy Spirit told me to be at peace because the dog walked away in shame. This was not a dream, but it seemed like a dream. It was a trance. In this trance the Lord gave me a revelation.</p>
<p>The dream that the magi had was this kind of special vision. Later, Mary&rsquo;s husband, Joseph, had many dreams, which were also this kind of dream. In the dream the magi were divinely instructed not to return to Herod, so they went home by another way. After a person has seen Christ, he will always take another way. A person who has seen Christ will never go the same way that he came. A person who has met the Lord and been touched by Him will always take another way.</p>
