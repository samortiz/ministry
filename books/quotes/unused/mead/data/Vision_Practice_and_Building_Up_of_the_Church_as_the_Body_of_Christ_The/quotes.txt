[1]  The Vision, Practice and Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  In these messages our burden is to consider the church in six aspects.
[3]  First, we need to see the church in eternity past in the purpose and plan of God.
[4]  Although it may seem that the church is not mentioned in the Old Testament, in actuality there are many references to the church in the Old Testament in the way of types and figures.
[5]  In Eve we see only the origin of the church, but the Shulammite as the counterpart of Solomon is a type of the church in a full way.
[6]  We need to read and study the stories of all those positive women to know the bridal aspect of the church, and we need to study the stories of all those wonderful buildings to know the building aspect of the church.
[7]  Ephesians 3:9-11 says, To enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[8]  Ephesians 1:8-11 says, Which He caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence, making known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Himself, unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him; in whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will.
[9]  In this passage we can see God s eternal purpose concerning the church.
[10]  Several times the writer of Ephesians uses the word Himself with emphasis, instead of simply Him v. 9; 2:15; 4:11; 5:2, 27 . The church must be something of God and in God Himself.
[11]  We need to know the proper spiritual vocabulary, including the word sonship.
[12]  Sonship indicates that we have the life, birth, and right of inheritance of a son.
[13]  However, simply because we are children of God does not mean that we are heirs of God.
[14]  By the spiritual birth we have received the life of God, but it is by the birthright that we will inherit all that God is, all that God has, all that God has planned, and all that God will accomplish.
[15]  Ephesians 1:4 says that we are holy and without blemish before Him in love.
[16]  To be without blemish does not mean that we are perfect.
[17]  Even if we seem to be perfect and holy, we still have blemishes if we are not overlaid with God.
[18]  Through the church God s manifold wisdom is made known to the rulers and authorities, and the enemy is subdued v. 10 . If there were not such an evil one in the universe, God s wisdom would not need to be manifested.
[19]  CHAPTER TWO THE THREE MAIN ITEMS OF GOD S PURPOSE FOR THE CHURCH 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:17-21; Eph 3:10-11; 1:10, 22-23; John 1:4; 8:12; Rev 21:11, 23-24; 22:1-2 TO HAVE THE DIVINE SONSHIP IN FULL
[20]  THROUGH SANCTIFICATION The Freedom of the Glory of the Children of God
[21]  Romans 8:17-19 says, If children, heirs also; on the one hand, heirs of God; on the other, joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him that we may also be glorified with Him.
[22]  Not only God but even the whole creation, all things, are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God.
[23]  to Fulfill God s Purpose and to Solve His Problems
[24]  The preaching in Christianity tells people, We are poor, sinful persons who will perish, so we need God s mercy and grace.
[25]  God is merciful and full of grace to us, so He sent His Son to save us from hell.
[26]  Now we are the beloved ones, and when God puts us together, we are the church.
[27]  God s purpose and intention in creating the many human beings is to make these men a Body as a vessel to contain Him that He may dwell in them and manifest Himself through them by mingling Himself with them.
[28]  Second, it means that we grow up with God and in God, and third, it means that we are absolutely mingled with God; every part of our being will be permeated, saturated, overlaid, and absolutely mingled with God.
[29]  Christ Being Head over All Things to the Church
[30]  Verse 10 says that all things will be headed up in Christ, and verse 22 says that at the time God raised Christ from the dead and lifted Him to the heavens in ascension, He put all things under Christ s feet and gave Him to be the Head over all things.
[31]  If Christ being the Head were only for the church, there would be no identification of the church with Christ, no identification of the Body with the Head.
[32]  To head up all things in Christ, subjected all things under His feet, gave Him to be Head over all things, to the church, and His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all are not ordinary utterances.
[33]  Therefore, the church must be built up through our experience of Christ as life.
[34]  Suppose, however, that by the mercy of God our eyes have been opened to see that God s economy is to work Himself into us as life, that we have to love Him, take Him as life, fellowship with Him, be filled with Him, and live by Him.
[35]  It is by His being life to the church and by the church being built up through this life that God shines out as the controlling factor, and it is by this shining that all creation will be brought back to God, released from confusion, and brought into the liberty which is under the shining of the sons of God.
[36]  We must not say that we are merely poor people to whom God has been merciful; that He has saved us and put us together as the church; that we are waiting for the Lord s coming to bring us into the glorious kingdom; and that if we die before that time, we will be taken into heaven.
[37]  Then we will be full of light, and under this light we will be controlled, we will have oneness and harmony, we will be built up, and we will become the universal vessel through which God will head up all things under the shining of His Body.
[38]  I am still burdened to speak about God s purpose concerning the church.
[39]  In my spirit is a realization that we are not deeply enough impressed with this matter.
[40]  Perhaps many of us have a little understanding, but we may not have been brought into a full realization.
[41]  Moreover, we should be able to speak the things we have heard and minister what we have been impressed with.
[42]  Third, God s purpose is to head up all things in Christ through the church 1:10, 21-23 .
[43]  Sonship includes our becoming a child of God by the new birth all the way to the manifestation of the sons of God.
[44]  The Bible clearly and thoroughly reveals that what God has been doing in the past generations, still is doing now, and will be doing in the future is to fully accomplish His sonship in us and to subdue the enemy, to cast out the serpent.
[45]  This will be done through the church and by the church.
[46]  We will review these again, because we need to be truly impressed with God s purpose.
[47]  This is the display, the demonstration of God s wisdom to the rulers, the authorities, the forces of darkness, Satan and all his followers.
[48]  By all of the above we can see clearly that in order to realize the church life, we first must know the real experience of Christ within us as our life.
[49]  However, the Lord told me, Look at John 6:57: As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me. Can we eat something without it being mingled with us? If we eat a chicken, the chicken and we are joined together.
[50]  In order to have the church life, we must realize Christ as life to us, not merely in a general way but in the way of food to be digested by us.
[51]  We need to grow, but merely to grow is not good enough.
[52]  These two verses say, Holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[53]  If we do not grow into Christ, we cannot receive anything from Him, but the more we grow into Him, the more we receive something from Him to minister to others.
[54]  If we are joints, we must do our duty to supply and to nourish, and if we are sinews, we must be faithful to join the Body together in love.
[55]  If we are the sinews, we have to keep this order; if we are the joints, we need to do our duty; and if we are one of the other members, we must operate within our measure.
[56]  In the previous messages we saw that there are three main items in God s purpose concerning the church.
[57]  This is a matter of life, not only the life we receive in our new birth but the growth of life, life in maturity and in fullness.
[58]  This means that God wants to work Himself into us to make us not only His sons but also His heirs to inherit all that He is and all He has.
[59]  Second, through this life and under the headship of Christ, all things will be headed up by Christ the Head through the church.
[60]  In life we are built up under the headship of Christ, and through this God has the ground to make His multifarious wisdom known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies so that He can challenge His enemy and put him to shame.
[61]  It is God s purpose that through the church He would manifest Himself through His Son, Christ, and put His enemy to shame.
[62]  Then as the center of God s creation, He created man to be His container, His vessel, that He might put Himself into man to be his life, wisdom, power, light, way, and his everything.
[63]  We are the vessels, the containers, made by God, so God purposely created a spirit within us to receive Him, contain Him, keep Him, and express Him.
[64]  All these Christians may never have heard a message on how God intends to work Himself into us through Christ as the Spirit so that Christ as the Head will be expressed through His Body to bring the whole universe under His headship.
[65]  The book of Ephesians does not talk about the material things, and it does not contain mere knowledge.
[66]  The new man created in Christ and by Christ is fully of Christ, and it is even Christ Himself.
[67]  At that time I was not clear about the central content of Ephesians, but through my experiences the Lord showed me that the church can be built up only by our experience of Christ as life, not by knowledge, gifts, or the so-called Pentecostal manifestations.
[68]  Verses 14-15 begin, For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father, of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named.
[69]  For this cause refers to God s plan mentioned in the previous chapters and verses, including our predestination unto sonship, the riches of Christ being ministered to us, Christ heading up all things, making the multifarious wisdom of God known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, putting the enemy to shame, and other matters.
[70]  Verse 16 continues, That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.
[71]  This is why the writer of Ephesians says that he prayed not in a light way but by bowing his knees, for the cause of the church as God s purpose, that the Father in the universe would grant us to be strengthened into the inner man.
[72]  Finally, verse 19 says, And to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[73]  We are not being filled with material things, scriptural knowledge, or the so-called spiritual gifts but unto all the fullness of God Himself.
[74]  It is in this way that we are built up together, and it is in this way that we can realize the Body life.
[75]  Otherwise, we can talk about the Body, but we still will not have its reality.
[76]  Ephesians 3 says that we are strengthened into the inner man, that Christ makes His home in our heart, and that we are filled not covered or clothed unto all the fullness of God, that is, the very being, essence, and element of God.
[77]  It is through this inner experience of the indwelling Christ that we apprehend with all the saints the unlimited measure of Christ, and it is by this that we are built up.
[78]  We must pray, O Father, strengthen us into the inner man, that Your Son, Christ, may make His home in our heart, to take over and possess our whole being, that we may grow in Him and receive something from Him.
[79]  This portion tells us that our inner man must be strengthened, Christ is making His home in our heart, and we are being filled unto all the fullness of God.
[80]  FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Eph 3:14-17a; 4:1-6, 11-16 THE NEED FOR CHRIST
[81]  Before Paul spoke concerning the vision of the church what the church is and how God planned to produce the church he prayed for us, realizing that we need a spirit of revelation, an inner openness, so that we may see the eternal things 1:15-23 .
[82]  The main point of this prayer is that our inner man must be strengthened so that Christ may make His home not in our spirit but in our heart.
[83]  Today even among us there is a big shortage of knowing in our experience how to be strengthened into the inner man by the mighty Spirit of God so that Christ may make His home in our heart.
[84]  There is no doubt that we have Christ in our spirit, but there is much doubt as to whether Christ has any place in our soul.
[85]  There may be no place, no room, and no ground for Christ in our mind, emotion, and will.
[86]  If this is the case, our spirit is not a residence for Christ but a prison to Him.
[87]  This is the reason why the apostle Paul, after revealing the vision of the Body in the first part of Ephesians, realized that we need our inner man, our spirit, to be strengthened that Christ may make His home in all the parts of the heart the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience.
[88]  If someone says that the Lord Jesus is not the Son of God, we should sacrifice our life to fight for the truth, but if someone wants to play the tambourine in the meeting, we should simply say, Brother, if you feel free to do that, then do it, but please also take care of others.
[89]  On the one hand, we all are one in the Spirit, in the Triune God, in the saving faith, and in all the matters in verses 4 through 6.
[90]  Verse 13 is a very important and practical verse.
[91]  It says, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[92]  As long as we believe that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God who was incarnated as a man, died on the cross for our sins, and resurrected, we are saved, regardless of whether or not we believe in a particular doctrine.
[93]  From now on, may we know nothing but Christ as our life, and may we come together in Him and with Him to practice the church life, walking, acting, working, serving in the spirit, and being limited by the Body.
[94]  If we are not clear about these points or if we do not practice them, we are still not in the proper practice of the church life.
[95]  He bows his knees before the Father that we may be strengthened into the inner man and that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that is, that Christ may occupy our whole being 3:14-17a .
[96]  To say these things is easy, but it is not easy to put them into practice.
[97]  Even in the Old Testament there is the thought that the gifts which Christ received from the Father and gave to the church are for the purpose of building up a dwelling place for God.
[98]  Christ in His human nature as a man, representing man, received gifts of men, and He gave them to His church that God might have a dwelling place.
[99]  Divisions Being Produced by Keeping the Church in the Hands of the Workers
[100]  The more gift a person has and the bigger the gift is, the more danger there is.
[101]  The fourth and fifth points in Ephesians 4 are growth and holding to truth, that is, holding Christ as the reality vv.
[102]  Ephesians 4:15-16 reveals that we are members of the Body of Christ, growing up into Him in all things.
[103]  Through this growth we experience something of Christ, partake of Him, and enjoy Him.
[104]  Ephesians 4:24 says, And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality.
[105]  The last portion of the book of Ephesians is instruction concerning the practical church life.
[106]  We should remember that after the apostle Paul gave a full vision of the church, he offered a prayer at the end of chapter 3 specifically that we would be strengthened into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our heart, that is, that He may spread, take over, and occupy our whole inward being vv.
[107]  Eventually we will be filled unto all the fullness of God; that is, we will be fully mingled with God.
[108]  The church life must be a life of our being mingled with God in which our inner man, our spirit, is strengthened.
[109]  We need to give message after message to stress this one matter, that our inner man must be strengthened and that Christ must take over our whole being so we can be mingled with God and filled unto all the fullness of God.
[110]  FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Not Grieving the Holy Spirit by Corrupt Speaking
[111]  Verse 30 of chapter 4 says, Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God.
[112]  It seems that there is no need to use the word Holy; we may simply say, the Spirit of God.
[113]  If we have the inner anointing with peace and joy, it is good to continue our speaking, but if we have the inner feeling that the Holy Spirit is checking us from within, and we do not have peace and joy, we are grieving Him.
[114]  We have the oneness of the Spirit, and we have the renewing in the spirit of the mind.
[115]  Now we must also have our speaking in the spirit.
[116]  If we minister death by our speaking, the building up of the church will be damaged, but if we minister grace and life through our word, it will be a great help for the building up of the church.
[117]  These verses say, Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father, being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[118]  Verses 25 through 27 say, Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish.
[119]  AND THE TEST OF OUR SPIRITUALITY Scripture Reading: Gen 28:10-19 THE VISION OF GOD S BUILDING All the Visions in the Scriptures Being
[120]  It is the oil, the person of the Spirit, in whom and by whom the very God comes into us to be one with us, producing Bethel, the house of God.
[121]  The Need to Build Up the Bride of Christ
[122]  Recently a brother spoke with me concerning prophecy and the world situation, telling me how he felt that the end of time is very near.
[123]  In addition to seeing the vision of God s building, we also need to see what the building is in practicality.
[124]  The building up of the church depends on our growth in life.
[125]  All the gifted persons given as gifts are for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ v. 12 . Verses 13 and 14 continue, Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, that we may be no longer little children tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to a system of error.
[126]  We hold Christ as the truth, the reality, and grow up into Him not only in one thing but also in all things, in all aspects, and in all directions of our life, in all that we are in our whole being.
[127]  These verses say, Coming to Him, a living stone, rejected by men but with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[128]  The Tabernacle and Temple Being Built through the Growth of the Produce of the Good Land
[129]  The people brought the surplus of their growth and offered it to God as materials to build up His house.
[130]  Therefore, the main thought of the Old Testament is that God s people are a tree and a crop to grow, and by this growth they are built up together as a dwelling place for God.
[131]  Being by the Increase of Christ within Us Only the Increase of Christ Availing
[132]  Life is Christ, and growth is the increase of life, so the growth of life is the increase of Christ within us.
[133]  When we were first saved, Christ came as a small seed into the innermost part, our human spirit, but He did not yet fill our soul.
[134]  For Christ to increase in us means that Christ takes the ground in us and spreads within us to saturate not only our soul but eventually even our body Rom 8:6, 10-11 .
[135]  The building up of the church is by the transformation of the soul Rom 12:2 .
[136]  As we have seen, we can be one not in ourselves but only in the conquering Christ.
[137]  BEING IN OUR HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17; 2:22; 3:5, 16; 4:23; 5:18; 6:18
[138]  In the previous messages we have seen that the building up of the church is God s aim and purpose, and this building is the test of our genuine spirituality.
[139]  In this message we will consider how the building up of the church is absolutely in our human spirit.
[140]  In order to have a practical church life, we must know our human spirit, and we must be in our spirit.
[141]  Ephesians 1:17 says, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.
[142]  That is why the apostle Paul, after he released the vision of the church, bowed his knees to pray specifically that we may be strengthened into our inner man, that we would be strong in our spirit, not in our mind.
[143]  Because all the fullness of God dwells in Christ Col 2:9 , and Christ possesses our whole being to make His home there, we will be filled unto all the fullness of God.
[144]  To be drunk with wine is to be filled in the body, but to be filled in spirit is to be filled with Christ, who is all that God is, the fullness of God.
[145]  DEALING WITH THE PROBLEMS IN THE HUMAN LIFE AND CHURCH LIFE BY OUR SPIRIT
[146]  According to the six chapters of Ephesians, our spirit must be enlightened to be a spirit of wisdom and revelation; this is the beginning of God s dwelling within us.
[147]  Our spirit must also be strengthened so that Christ may gain more ground to take possession of our whole being.
[148]  This spirit becomes the spirit of our mind to take over, subdue, and control our mind.
[149]  Then we need to be filled in our spirit and pray at every time in our spirit.
[150]  If we have such a spirit, we will have no problems with the building up of the church.
[151]  If a husband and wife have a spirit that is always enlightened by God and full of wisdom and revelation, a spirit that is the dwelling place of God, a strengthened spirit that always gives Christ more ground within them, a spirit that takes possession of their mind, a spirit that is filled, and a praying spirit, they will have no problems in their marriage life.
[152]  Throughout all the years in the past and in all the places I have been, I have learned this lesson.
[153]  We all have a heart for the Lord, we have seen the vision of the church, and we desire to practice the genuine church life.
[154]  When we are in the spirit, even when there are problems in the church, we are not bothered and we do not get involved with them.
[155]  The first section of three chapters gives us a revelation, a definition, of the church, showing us what the church is, from where it comes, and where it stands.
[156]  Then the second section of three chapters shows us how to realize the church life in a practical way.
[157]  At the opening of the section concerning the practice of the church life Paul says, I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace 4:1-3 .
[158]  In addition, many Christians who talk about the church life pay attention to the seven ones in 4:4-6: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God.
[159]  First, we should never set up a high standard for others.
[160]  In the church we must be careful concerning our speech and conversation.
[161]  A brother may wrong us, but for the Lord s glory and for the sake of the church life, we should not speak a word about it.
[162]  However, if we have learned the lesson, for the Lord s glory and for the sake of His church we will not say a word.
[163]  AND ONE SPEAKING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:10; Phil 1:27; 2:1-2; 4:2; 1 Tim 1:3-7
[164]  First Corinthians 1:10 says, Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.
[165]  First we have the same mind, then we have the same opinion, and eventually we speak the same thing.
[166]  Philippians 1:27 says, Only, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether coming and seeing you or being absent, I may hear of the things concerning you, that you stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel.
[167]  The subject of all these Epistles, written by the same apostle, is simply the building economics of God with Christ as life as the center and content and with the church as the vessel, the building, the house, to contain and express this very Christ.
[168]  About ten years ago in Taiwan a very spiritual brother with a high spiritual ministry came among us.
[169]  Some brothers like to speak more, so they say, Brother, I baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God, or, I baptize you in the name of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
