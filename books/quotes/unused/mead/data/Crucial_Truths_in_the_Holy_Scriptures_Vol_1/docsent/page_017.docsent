   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO IMPART GIFTS TO THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer is not just to come upon the believer to empower him but also to give him spiritual inspiration and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two steps, the coming upon and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, include all the work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two steps of the work of the Holy Spirit outside of the believer are related.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit coming upon the believer is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on him, often resulting in his receiving spiritual inspiration and spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although the coming and outpouring of the Holy Spirit does not always cause the believer to receive spiritual gifts, a believer must have the Holy Spirit come upon him and must have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in order to receive spiritual inspiration, and hence, spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such spiritual gifts always come from the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit 1 Cor 12:4-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Spiritual gifts are spiritual abilities and skills, enabling the believer to do spiritual things and to manifest spiritual functions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether these gifts are healing, working wonders, prophesying, tongues, or other gifts, they are the abilities and skills of the Holy Spirit that enable a believer to do spiritual work and fulfill God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although there are distinctions and different measures of gifts, these spiritual abilities and skills come from the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit: The one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer not only empowers the believer to work for the Lord but also gives gifts to him, enabling him to do God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as the Holy Spirit s coming upon the believers through His outpouring causes believers to be empowered, so also His inspiration on believers through His outward moving causes them to be gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Power is a matter of strength, whereas gifts are a matter of skill.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A believer can carry out an intense spiritual work for the Lord in order to serve God only when power is combined with gift and gift is added to power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable 1 Cor 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The manifestation of gifts in the believers through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit causes the believers to work for God and accomplish God s great plan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These gifts are also given to every believer for what is profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All the gifts given through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit enable the believer to do things for God so that all may profit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Any gift of inspiration that does not profit others is questionable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Say, Jesus is Lord...in the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The inspiration of the Holy Spirit is given for what is profitable and also causes one to say, Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The outpouring of the Holy Spirit proves that the Lord Jesus has been made both Lord and Christ by God Acts 2:33-36 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, the goal of the Holy Spirit s inspiration is not merely to profit others but also to exalt the Lord Jesus, causing the believers to confess that Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All inspirations that do not produce a confession that Jesus is Lord are not of the Holy Spirit but of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All who are inspired by the Holy Spirit will say, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Among the four steps of the work that the Holy Spirit accomplishes on the believers, two are inward and two are outward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Regeneration and indwelling occur in the believers, whereas outward filling and inspiration occur outside the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Regeneration and indwelling are for the spiritual life of the believers so that they may have both a beginning and a maturity in their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Outward filling and inspiration are for the spiritual work of the believers so that they may possess both power and gifts for spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A healthy, normal Christian who is up to the standard has balanced and adequate experiences of these four aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He has the regenerating and indwelling Spirit within so that he may have a rich and matured life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He also has the filling and inspiring Spirit without so that he may do a strong spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not think that because we have regeneration and indwelling within, we have no need of filling and inspiration without.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even more, we must not confuse outward filling and inspiration with inward regeneration and indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These four aspects of the Holy Spirit s work should not be mixed or substituted for each other.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should have His regenerating and indwelling inwardly as well as His filling and inspiring outwardly.</S>
