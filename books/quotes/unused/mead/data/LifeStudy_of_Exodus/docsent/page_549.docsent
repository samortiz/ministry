   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Divine Principle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a divine principle that God does not ask us to work until we have had enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God first supplies us with enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then after a full enjoyment with Him and of Him, we may work together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not know how to have enjoyment with God and how to enjoy God Himself, we shall not know how to work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We shall not know how to be one with God in His divine work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do emphasize the matter of working with God and not working for God by our own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yes, we should work with God and even by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But according to what the Bible reveals, it is not even sufficient merely to work with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to be one with God in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This requires that we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not know how to enjoy God and be filled with God, we shall not know how to work with Him, how to be one with Him in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A very good illustration of this principle is found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The New Testament ministry of the apostles began with the enjoyment they had on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The disciples did not work for six days and then enjoy the Lord on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The actual situation was that the Lord had told them to wait until the Spirit came upon them to fill them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With what were the disciples filled when they were filled with the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No doubt, they were filled with the enjoyment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because they were filled with the Spirit, others thought that they were drunk with wine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually they were filled with the enjoyment of the heavenly wine.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only after they had been filled with this enjoyment did they begin to work with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the way to work with God, the way to work in oneness with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Peter stood up with the apostles to preach the gospel and thereby do a work for God, they all were one with God in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The day of Pentecost was the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Pentecost denotes the fiftieth day after a period of seven weeks, or forty-nine days.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know from Leviticus 23 that the day of Pentecost was fifty days after the feast of firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that Pentecost was the first day of the eighth week.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, concerning the day of Pentecost, we see the principle of the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To man, the day of rest has always been the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to the Old Testament Sabbath, the day of man s rest was his first day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, according to the New Testament, the eighth day, the day of rest for man, was also the first day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the principle in the Old Testament, man s day of rest is a day that comes after God s work has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man does not rest after his own work is finished; he rests after the completion of God s work and enjoys it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God works, and man enjoys.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Man enjoys what God has accomplished in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As soon as man was created, he needed air to breathe and water to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God had already created the expanse, the atmosphere, on the second day because He knew that without air man would not be able to live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He had also prepared water and food for him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason the seventh day was a day of rest for God: He had worked for six days to make everything ready for man to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When man came forth from God s creating hand, his first day was God s seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, he had enjoyment with God, he lived with God, he walked with God, and eventually he was ready to work with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God had put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it Gen 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps after enjoying rest with God on his first day, Adam worked to care for the garden for another six days.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then on what was his eighth day, another first day, he again rested with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a cycle that would continue again and again with intervals of resting and working.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With God it is a matter of working and resting; with man, a matter of resting and working.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After God gave the revelation concerning the tabernacle and the furniture, and after God selected the builders and gave Moses a charge regarding them, He went on to speak again of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seems as if God were saying, Do not forget My Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Don t take the excuse that you are not laboring on your own business, but are doing a divine work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You should not think that because you are working to build My dwelling place, you can work every day continually.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No, even in doing My divine work, the work of building the tabernacle, you must still bear a sign to indicate that you are My people and you need Me. Therefore you need to enjoy Me first.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then you will be able to work not only for Me, but also with Me and by being one with Me. I will be your strength to work and your energy to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if you work in yourself and by yourself, that will be an insult to Me. You must do the work of building My dwelling place with Me, by Me, and in oneness with Me. I shall be very happy if you work in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if you try to do a good work for Me by yourselves, leaving Me aside, that would be an insult to Me, for that is a sign of the Devil s people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You are My people, and you should bear a sign that you need Me to be your enjoyment, strength, and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You need Me to be your everything so that you may be able to work for Me. By working in this way you honor Me and glorify Me. This is to bear a sign indicating that you are My people.</S>
