   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. Not Having Much Maturity in Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Isaac had some maturity in life, but not very much.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although he blessed, he blessed blindly 27:21-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His blessing was according to his natural taste 27:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He blessed blindly, not only physically but also spiritually, because he had been blinded by his natural taste.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, he did bless by faith Heb 11:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He had said that his soul would bless, but eventually it was not his soul that blessed; it was his spirit that bestowed the blessing, and his blessing became a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No one can prophesy in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we would prophesy, we must be in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thus, Isaac did bless in the spirit by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Faith does not depend upon what we are; it depends upon what we see.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whenever you want to exercise faith, you should not look at yourself, at what you are, nor at your environment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You must look at what God is and to what He says.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then you will be able to exercise your faith in God and in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaac blessed by faith in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to his situation, he was not qualified to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But he did not consider what he was; he looked away to God and to God's promise, blessing his son by faith and in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would have faith, we must look away from ourselves, for if we look at ourselves, faith will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Look unto God and see what He has spoken in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then simply utter what God has already spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Isaac blessed his son in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>f.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Died in Faith at the Fullness of Days</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although there is no hint in the Bible that Isaac was very spiritual, he did not die in a miserable condition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He died in faith at the fullness of days 35:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is proved by the fact that his sons buried him, along with his wife Rebekah, in the cave of Machpelah 49:30-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before he died, he must have charged his sons to bury him in the cave of Machpelah, where Abraham and Sarah were buried.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This proves that Isaac had the faith of Abraham.</S>
