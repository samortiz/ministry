   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Letter Two</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To my brother in the Lord, Watchman Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were both saved by the blood of the Lord Jesus so we could escape that great perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are supported by the Lord's holy hand daily in order that we can walk the way of the cross in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But I am most lonely and desolate because there is no brother to contact me in this place where messengers of Satan daily worship Buddha.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I only see my class of twenty elementary students all day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes I testify of the Lord to them, but they always debate with me and refuse to accept Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not know when the Spirit of the Lord will work in their hearts to save them from darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every Lord's Day, I have no place to go to break bread and remember the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although there is a chapel in Kao Tze Tsen, they are Methodist and must listen to the commandments of man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I feel sorry for them, and I worry that my own life cannot grow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the sake of the Lord's love, please announce to the brothers and sisters to pray for this useless little child of God, that he could overcome the world through the Lord's death and glorify the Lord in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I will not say anything else now.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Until next time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>NEWS FROM TAI HO COUNTY,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>NORTHERN ANHUI PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a letter from Mr. Liu Heng Teh of Tai Ho County to a missionary of a certain denomination, asking to leave the denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Greetings to Missionary Yu Ying:</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Several months have passed since we parted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been thinking much of you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that the truth may become clearer to you and that your path is in harmony with high morality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have been shown by the Father God something of the principles of the Bible; that is, once a person believes in the Lord Jesus, he must learn to obey the Father God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible says, "Awake, sleeper...understand what the will of the Lord is" Eph 5:14, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should have a heart to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should imitate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should leave all man-made policies, and we should leave all divisive names of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have also examined the New Testament, and there is no name there for this or that church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is no name like China Inland Mission, Presbyterian Church, Independent Church, Baptist Church, Assembly of God, Methodist Church, or any other denominational name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I think that since God chose His children, our names are already inscribed in the book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, I ask you in love to remove my name and my position from the books of your denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I also hope that you will obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I bless you with peace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Christian,</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Liu Heng Teh</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>February 20, 1934</S>
