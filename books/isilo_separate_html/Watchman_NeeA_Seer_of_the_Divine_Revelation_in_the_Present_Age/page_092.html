OTHERS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. False Condemnation and Imprisonment</H2><P>Watchman Nee was arrested in March 1952. He was judged, falsely condemned, and sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment in 1956. He died in confinement on May 30, 1972. There is no way to know what he experienced of the Lord during this long imprisonment. The following eight letters were written at the end of his confinement in his own handwriting and are the only means through which we can see a small glimpse of his suffering, feeling, and expectation during his confinement.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Letter One</H2><P>April 22, 1972<br>Eldest Sister Pin-cheng,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>I received your letter of April 7, and found that you had not received my letter, in which I notified you that the things you sent me every time have been received. All the things you mentioned in your letter I have received. I am very grateful to you.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>You know my physical condition is chronic, an illness of the organ itself. When it is activated I suffer much, but even when it is latent, it is still present with me. The difference is whether or not it is activated. Summer is here, and although more exposure to the sun can alter a little the color of my skin, it cannot change the illness. However, I maintain my joy, so please do not worry. I hope you will also take care of yourself and be filled with joy in your heart.</P><P>I wish you well.</P><P>Shu-tsu</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_091.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_093.html">Next</a> </body></html>
