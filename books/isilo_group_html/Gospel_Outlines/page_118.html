<h1 class="title">ETERNAL SALVATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 10:28-29</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Salvation is eternal life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The salvation that the Lord gives us is His eternal life. The characteristic of His life is eternal. Therefore the characteristic of His salvation is eternal and will never change.</li>
	<li>To obtain salvation is to obtain something eternal. So it is eternal salvation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To be saved is to be in the Lord&rsquo;s hand
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The saved ones not only have the Lord&rsquo;s life, but also are in the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</li>
	<li>The Lord will never change. The Lord&rsquo;s hand is a mighty hand which will never lose its power. So because of His power, they that are in the Lord&rsquo;s hand will never perish.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To be saved is to be in God&rsquo;s hand
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To be saved is to have eternal life in us; it also means that we enter into two hands, that of the Lord and that of the Father.</li>
	<li>While the Lord&rsquo;s hand is a mighty hand, the Father&rsquo;s hand is a hand of love. Because of the Lord&rsquo;s power and because of the Father&rsquo;s love, we shall never perish.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The proof of not perishing
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fact of not perishing is based on the Lord&rsquo;s life as well as on both the Lord&rsquo;s hand and the Father&rsquo;s hand. One life and two hands are the fact of our not perishing.</li>
	<li>The basis of our not perishing is the word of the Lord. The Lord said, &ldquo;They shall by no means perish forever.&rdquo; This word is the basis of our not perishing. Furthermore the Lord said, &ldquo;I give to them eternal life.&rdquo; This word is the basis of our obtaining eternal life.</li>
	</ol></li>
