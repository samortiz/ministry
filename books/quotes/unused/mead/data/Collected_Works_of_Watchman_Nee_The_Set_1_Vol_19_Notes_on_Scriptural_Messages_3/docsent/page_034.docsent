   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. What the Lord Himself Said</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 28:20 says, "Teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And behold, I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word was spoken by the Lord to all the disciples when He was living on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He commanded His disciples to go and disciple all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He also charged the disciples to teach them with His teachings that they may keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, all the teachings in the Gospels are spoken to the Christians, not to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord's commandments were not only given to the disciples of that time, but also to those who heard the apostles' teaching and believed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What the Holy Spirit Said</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>John 14:26 says, "But the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things and remind you of all the things which I have said to you."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Holy Spirit will cause us to remember every word, whatever they are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, the Holy Spirit wants to lead us back to the words of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What Paul Said</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Colossians 3:16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is what Paul charged the Christians in Colossae to do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But what about today?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those friends who believe the whole church will be raptured before the tribulation say that the teachings of the four Gospels were spoken to the Jews, not to the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But this is not what the Lord, or the Holy Spirit, or Paul told us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit and Paul both bring us back to the teachings of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why do our brothers say that the teachings of the four Gospels have nothing to do with the church?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is because there are so many places in the four Gospels that say that whosoever does not watch and pray and does not prepare in waiting will be left behind when the Lord comes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we cite a verse from the Gospels which mentions that the rapture is conditioned upon being watchful and prepared, they will answer that these words are for the Jews and not for the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whether or not one is watchful or prepared, according to them, he will be raptured as long as he is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is just man's theory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord did not say this; the Holy Spirit did not say this; and Paul did not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, such presumption cannot stand.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the teachings of Christ while He was on the earth were spoken to us, the church, then we know that to be regenerated alone is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must also be diligently watching and preparing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is impossible for the whole church the born again ones to be raptured before the tribulation, because the whole church is not watchful and prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Sixth Presumption</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew 24:14 says, "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our brothers say that the gospel of the kingdom is different from the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is saved through the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The gospel of the kingdom is for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They say that there are two stages for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One is when the Lord was living on the earth; one is at the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church preaches the gospel of grace, not the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why do they say that the gospel of grace is toward the church and the gospel of the kingdom is toward the Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because they advocate that we depend on grace for everything; even our rapture depends on grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Watching and preparing is work, not grace.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is spoken of in the four Gospels is the kingdom; therefore, the references to preparing and watching in them are all for the Jews and not related to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They pay special attention to distinguishing the gospel of grace from the gospel of the kingdom; yet little do they know that the gospel of God is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In letter, the gospel of grace and the gospel of the kingdom, of course, have their own special distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But, in fact, the gospel of the kingdom includes the gospel of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the truths of the kingdom are for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not shovel them upon the Jews just because they are deep and make demands upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not only do the Gospels speak about the kingdom; even the book of Acts, which speaks the most about the church, speaks about the kingdom also.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us see what the book of Acts says regarding this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By this we will see the kingdom's relationship to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>a. What the Lord Jesus Preached</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Acts 1:3 says, "To whom also He presented Himself alive after His suffering by many irrefutable proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After the Lord's resurrection, what was He speaking about for forty days?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He spoke of the things pertaining to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What Philip Preached</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Acts 8:12 says, "But when they believed Philip, who announced the gospel of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here it says that the gospel which Philip preached was the gospel of the kingdom of God.</S>
