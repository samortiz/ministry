   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE 11 Scripture Reading: Matt 16:26; Luke 9:25 DISPOSITION AND CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will fellowship about dealing with our disposition and character.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The words disposition and character both have many different denotations in dictionaries and lexicons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have used these words very much in their spiritual denotations for the last forty to fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In one of the early trainings in Taiwan, we presented thirty points of character which were later published in the book Character.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later, we began to stress the matter of our disposition very much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have discovered that character is the expression of something inward, that is, the matter of disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Outwardly it is character, but inwardly it is disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To deal with the character but neglect the disposition is futile.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have used the words disposition and character in my ministry concerning the spiritual life because I was forced to find terms which would help the saints to understand the soul-life, the self, the "I," and the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The terms natural life and natural have also been used related to the spiritual experiences of dealing with our self.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The self is our soulish life, and the soulish life is something natural.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition to these terms, Paul mentions the old man in Romans 6:6.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Each of these terms denotes a certain spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With human beings there is something called the self, the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The soul-life is also called the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The self, the soul-life, and the old man are all something natural, something of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our fellowship concerning disposition and character, we do not use the definitions and denotations which are commonly used in the many dictionaries and lexicons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather, we define these terms according to their spiritual significance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Disposition refers to something within our being, and character refers to something in our outward being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Within we have our disposition, and without we have our character.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Disposition is what we are within, and character is what we express without.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The inward disposition and the outward character are the extract, the essence, of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If our character and disposition were taken away, there would be nothing left to our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The terms character and disposition cannot be found in the New Testament, but the facts are implied in verses such as Matthew 16:26 and Luke 9:25.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 16:26 and Luke 9:25 are parallel portions which use self and soul-life as synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matthew 16:26 says, "For what shall a man be profited if he should gain the whole world, but forfeit his soul-life?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke 9:25 says, "For what is a man profited, having gained the whole world, but having lost or forfeited himself?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The soul-life in Matthew 16:26 is the self in Luke 9:25.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The soul is the life of the self, and the matters of disposition and character are very much related to both the self and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Disposition</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To illustrate the differences in disposition, we may use different animals, such as a turtle and a rabbit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A turtle walks slowly, and a rabbit runs quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Each activity is related to a particular thing within the nature of each animal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This inward thing is what we may call its disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The turtle and the rabbit each has its own disposition, its own makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our Christian experience, there is something within us called our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This disposition is what we are in our makeup.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Each of us has a particular and unique disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Inwardly in our disposition, we are quite different from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your disposition denotes what you are in your makeup by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever you are by birth is your disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you are slow, you were made slow by birth; being slow is your disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, if you are quick, quickness is your disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One may be silent or talkative; both are matters of inward disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although our disposition is something made by God, yet it still needs to be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This seems to be contradictory something given by God must be dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, this is very much according to the divine revelation, and it is also confirmed by our experience.</S>
