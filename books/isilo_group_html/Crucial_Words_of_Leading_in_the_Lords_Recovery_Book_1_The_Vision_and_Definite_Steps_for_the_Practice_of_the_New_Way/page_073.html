IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The recovery of the building in the Old Testament was fully accomplished by and through warfare. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said that the gates of Hades, which belong to Satan, would never prevail against the built-up church (Matt. 16:18). The apostle Paul speaks specifically about the church in the book of Ephesians. He speaks about the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ, the counterpart of Christ, the new man, God&rsquo;s house, and God&rsquo;s kingdom. Lastly, he speaks about the church as the warrior, fighting on behalf of God&rsquo;s economy. Paul himself was a warrior. Before his martyrdom, he declared, &ldquo;I have fought the good fight&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:7). This is the proper position and responsibility of the church.</p>
<p>Satan always comes behind God to damage His church. He causes the church to become fallen and degraded. Even when the apostle Paul was on earth, the church had become desolate. Paul saw the churches that he had built up with his own hands being damaged by Satan and brought into desolation. When he wrote the books of Philippians, Colossians, and 1 and 2 Timothy, he was very clear about the situation. He even said, &ldquo;All who are in Asia turned away from me&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:15). The church became so desolate that it had even deserted Paul. Yet Paul was not discouraged. He exhorted Timothy to &ldquo;war the good warfare&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:18), which was to fight against the different teachings of the dissenting ones and to accomplish God&rsquo;s economy according to his ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life (v. 4), so that God, who is worthy of all praises, might be glorified (vv. 11-17).</p>
<p>At that time the greatest problem was the different teachings of the dissenting ones. This problem brought in great damage to the church. Paul told Timothy to remain in Ephesus to &ldquo;charge certain ones not to teach different things...rather than God&rsquo;s economy&rdquo; (vv. 3-4). For Timothy to do this was for him to war the good warfare. To war the good warfare is not to swing with our fists or kick with our feet. It is, on the negative side, to defeat and destroy the winds of different teachings, and on the positive side, to carry out God&rsquo;s economy. Paul clearly points out that it is insufficient merely to not teach different things; we must also speak God&rsquo;s economy. Today we are faced with the same warfare. Hence, to war the good warfare, to withstand the downward drift of the church, and to carry out God&rsquo;s economy is to preach the gospel of grace and eternal life according to the apostles&rsquo; ministry.</p>
<p>In 6:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Fight the good fight of the faith; lay hold on the eternal life, to which you were called.&rdquo; To fight the good fight is to lay hold on the eternal life. This life is the divine life, God&rsquo;s uncreated life, and the eternal life. The words <em>eternal life</em> are related more to the divine nature than to time. In our Christian life, and especially in our Christian work, we need to lay hold on God&rsquo;s eternal life and not trust in our human life in order to fight the good fight of the faith. Hence, the two books of Timothy and the book of Titus repeatedly emphasize the eternal life (1 Tim. 1:16; 6:19; 2 Tim. 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7). This life is a necessary and basic prerequisite in order to accomplish God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church as depicted in 1 Timothy, to withstand the declining trend of the church as depicted in 2 Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church as depicted in Titus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR WARFARE TODAY</h2>
<p>Our work today is to build up the home meetings, teach the truth, and spread the gospel. In other words, it is to beget, nourish, and teach. These are things that are absolutely contrary to what Christianity is doing. It is a move against the tide. We are conscious that we are fighting a battle. We need to struggle to swim upstream. We must fight against the current. Consequently, we encounter difficulty at every stage. We all know that it is easy to flow downstream. There is no need to exert any strength; we can easily glide along, but to swim upstream requires a continual struggle. To press forward requires fighting.</p>
<p>Concerning these three matters, the burden within me is too heavy for words. I am already an old man, yet I still need to bear such a heavy burden. The only way I can explain it is that this is something that the Lord wants. Today the church has been corrupted by Christianity to such an extent that it has fully become a religion and an organization. In such an organization, two things are produced&mdash;a clergy-laity system and hierarchy. Through the practice of the clergy-laity system, hierarchy is built up. The Catholic Church takes the pope as its head, and the different Protestant groups take their founders as their heads. Under the pope and these founders, there is a distinct class of people who are different from others. People are separated into different categories and classes. This completely obliterates the life relationship among God&rsquo;s children and annuls their organic function.</p>
<p>Through Brother Nee we saw the light sixty years ago that the most important matter in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is that we be free from any organized religion. During the past sixty years we have paid much attention to this matter. Still, we admit that we have never rid ourselves fully of its influence even though we emphasize this so much. This is a battle. We have never been completely freed from the bondage of this organized religion because of the entanglement of the power of darkness and our sluggish disposition. Those without the spiritual insight do not see anything concerning the power of darkness. Everyone today says that religion is a good thing. Furthermore, Satan has even mixed some wicked things with our knowledge of the Bible through his cunning tactics.</p>
<p>The whole of Christianity is an organization of religion. It can be compared to the big tree described by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 13. It has taken root, settled on the earth, and become a huge organization. All Christians have been organized together and absorbed into it. The Lord has raised us up to stand against this great organization. We have been fighting this battle for more than sixty years, but to a certain extent, even our own brothers and sisters are not clear. Even our co-workers have become confused, considering that we are the same as Christianity. We consider ourselves the same as Christianity. Look at our situation today. How are we different from Christianity? Where are the distinctions? Some brothers and sisters even say, &ldquo;Are not some Christians more zealous than we are? They are also preaching the gospel.&rdquo; As time goes by, black and white seem to be the same, fresh water and salt water become indistinguishable, and the pure and the polluted are mixed together. The reason such a situation has developed is that we have not fully rid ourselves of the clergy-laity system. The presence of the concept of a hierarchy results in this kind of an organization.</p>
<p>I hope that we will understand the fellowship in this message in a proper way. I hope that by the grace of the Lord we will take this clear word. We need to admit that two years ago in 1984 the clergy-laity system was very strong among us, even here in Taiwan. We did not have the form, but we had the fact. In order to deal with this matter, we saw from the Lord that we needed to deal with this from its roots. We must remove this practice from among us completely; otherwise, we will have no way to go on. This was why I have spoken so strongly against the big meetings and emphasized the small group meetings. I made it clear from the beginning that eventually the small group meetings should be brought into the homes. Once the meetings move to the homes and the church life is established in the homes, the clergy-laity system will have no more ground. Once the clergy-laity system loses its ground, the system of hierarchy will be uprooted and removed.</p>
<p>I am not speaking empty teachings. I am speaking facts based on our history. Hence, what we now need the most is for the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers to become absolutely clear that it is not a small thing for us to set up home meetings. We are transplanting our &ldquo;produce&rdquo; from the realm of religion to the homes of the saints. Once they are transplanted to the homes, there will be no further opportunity for the clergy-laity system to surface. If every home has a meeting, every person is speaking, and no one wants to be the head, how can the clergy-laity system remain? However, if we cannot achieve these three ends, the clergy-laity system will remain, and the religious organization will continue.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_072.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_074.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 73</div><br></body></html>
