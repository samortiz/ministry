   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we want to go on to see the position of the Word in the organic building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible tells us that the Spirit is God and that the Word is God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In other words, God is the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that God as the Spirit is our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 4:24 tells us that God is Spirit, and John 1:1 says that the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God, the Spirit, and the Word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have one wonderful Savior, who is God, the Spirit, and the Word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, the Word is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 6:63, the Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 6:17 speaks of the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I call on the name of the Lord and pray, I have the deep sensation that the Spirit is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although I have this inward, divine sensation, I may not understand much.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I come to the Word, the Word speaks to me and explains something to me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Word explains to me what I have sensed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Word gives me the definition of the sensations of the Spirit within me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I speak the word to the saints according to my sensation of the Spirit within me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we receive the Word, it becomes the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the Spirit within us becomes the word uttered by us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When some receive this word, it enters into them and becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit and the Word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must pray by calling on the name of the Lord, and we must read the Bible so that we can have both the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we merely read the Word without much prayer by calling on the Lord, we will only have the Word without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then the Word will be very dry and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our reading of the Word will be empty, mental stimulus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>While we are reading, we need to pray, and while we are praying, we should call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should make praying, calling, and reading one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Calling on the Lord s name is for praying, and praying is for reading.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, our reading of the Bible becomes pray-reading by calling.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Bible we are told that we have to feed on the divine Word, that we have to eat the Word Jer 15:16; Matt 4:4; John 6:57, 63 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not just read, understand, and receive the Word in a doctrinal way, but we have to take the Word in by eating it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The best way to get into the Word in this way is to pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not merely exercise our eyes to read the Word and exercise our mind to understand and receive the Word in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After reading, understanding, and receiving the Word, we have to exercise our spirit, because the Word is not just knowledge, but it is composed of the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the word of the Bible is the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Surely we have to read, understand, and receive the Word by exercising our eyes, mind, and heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many of us, though, may stop here, thinking that we understand a certain verse or a part of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may understand it, but it has not been assimilated into our spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why we all have to learn to pray-read the Word by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Throughout the history of the church, many godly saints, although they did not have the term pray-read, had the reality of pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They read the Word prayerfully, with prayer and by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever we pray, our spirit is exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To understand the Word is to exercise our mind, to receive the Word is to exercise our heart, and to pray is to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just as we walk by exercising our feet, we pray by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to learn to exercise our spirit to eat the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After eating the word in our spirit, spontaneously something of God s essence will be assimilated into our spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is similar to the physical food that we eat being digested and assimilated into our blood to become the cells and tissues of our physical being.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our physical being has been built up with food that we have eaten, digested, and assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For the Body of Christ to be built up organically, we need the Word as our spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we only exercise our mind to read a verse like John 1:1 without exercising our spirit, it may be very dry and empty to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need to turn our reading into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to read, pray, and call, Lord, thank You that in the beginning was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thank You that You are the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>O Lord Jesus, You were in the beginning as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By reading, praying, and calling with such a verse, we are watered, stirred up, enlightened, and made alive.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should combine reading, praying, and calling together.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We need to read by praying and pray by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this way we can receive God as the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we receive God as the Spirit, we are drinking, and when we receive God as the Word, we are eating.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, we enjoy God as our drink and food, and we are nourished, satisfied, supplied, saturated, and enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes people ask me why I am so fresh, living, and active.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The key is to contact the very God by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He is so close to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is in our spirit, butw e have to be positive and aggressive all the time to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is good to call on the Lord ten times before we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This calling makes our prayer so living.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We may have prayed ourselves to sleep in the past because we did not touch God in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God is not only near us but also in us as the Spirit, so we must exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we call, O Lord Jesus, we are enlivened in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to exercise our spirit to touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we can open up the Word to read by praying and to pray by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We can blend and mix our reading, praying, and calling into one.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then we will touch God, touch the Spirit, and touch the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God is not only the Spirit and the Word but also the light.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When we contact God in the way of pray-reading and calling, we will touch God s life, be brought into God s life, and in this life, we will see the light.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We will be enlightened and exposed to realize our real condition and situation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Spontaneously we will be like Isaiah who said to the Lord, I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips Isa 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>God is the Spirit, the Word, the light, and also the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we touch God as the Spirit and the Word, we are nourished, saturated, and enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Furthermore, He ministers Himself into us as love so that we can love even our enemies Matt 5:44; Rom 12:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Sometimes we will be enlightened to see that we need to apologize to someone or make restitution.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we stay with God for a time, He will be love to us.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God as love will be dispensed into our being, and this love enables us to apologize to people.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We can enjoy God as the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then we enjoy God as light and love.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>By this we are altogether enlightened, exposed, and supplied, being ministered to by God to enjoy Him as our bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is the way to be built up, to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we all take this way, the entire Body of Christ will be built up with the Spirit and with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God s word is the constant word of God Acts 4:31 and the instant word of life 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Because the word is a matter of life, it can grow 6:7 , multiply 12:24 , and be strong 19:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The word is strong, so it is prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It can overcome all the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Because the word prevailed to grow and multiply in Acts, the number of the disciples in Jerusalem multiplied exceedingly 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>For the number of the church to increase, we all have to learn not only to enjoy the word but also to speak the word.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The apostles did not leave the word 6:2 , the believers preached the word 8:4 , the apostles spoke the word 13:46 , and people listened to the word 13:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We have to stick ourselves to the word and speak the word with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>When we speak, we need to call on the Lord inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When we speak the word, we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The way to get the Spirit is to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Then when we speak, the Spirit speaks, and we have the divine speaking in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Then the very Lord who is one spirit with us speaks in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This makes our speaking God s oracle because not only are we speaking but also God is speaking in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Thank the Lord for the Spirit and the Word in the organic building up of the church.</S>
