AS THE REALITY OF THE RESURRECTED CHRIST</h2>
<p>Another organic process in the Spirit is regeneration. Regeneration is by the Spirit as the reality of the resurrected Christ (John 3:6b; 1 Pet. 1:3). By the resurrected Christ as life we are regenerated. The reality of this resurrected Christ is the regenerating Spirit. Baptism puts us into the consummated Triune God, and regeneration puts the embodiment of the consummated God into us. Baptism puts us into Him, and regeneration puts Him into us. This is a union of life, an organic union. At the time that we believed into Jesus and we were baptized into the consummated God, we got into Him and He got into us. He and we were united together organically.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEALED WITH THE SPIRIT AS THE ESSENCE OF GOD</h2>
<p>Another organic process in the Spirit that we experience is that we are sealed with the Spirit as the essence of God (Eph. 1:13). When we are sealed with the Spirit as a living seal, this seal remains. Furthermore, the sealing of the Spirit in the New Testament is an ongoing process. It is going on continuously to infuse us with the very essence of God as the ink. If I put a seal full of ink on a piece of paper and kept it there for ten minutes, it would saturate through the paper. The ink would be transfused into the paper. The Holy Spirit as the essence of God seals us with Himself as the ink in the same way. The sealing ink of the Spirit&rsquo;s sealing is the essence of God. The Spirit&rsquo;s sealing us is to transfuse all that God is into our being, to saturate our being with the very essence of God. Such sealing makes us divine and brings our inward parts into an organic union with the Triune God. We may say that being baptized into the Spirit, regenerated by the Spirit, and sealed with the Spirit form one group of the organic processes in the Spirit that we experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INDWELT BY THE RESURRECTING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The sealing Spirit is now indwelling us. We are indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit (Rom. 8:11). This means that He remains in us. Now we have the very indwelling presence of the consummated God remaining in our being so that we can enjoy Him. This One now dwells in us to do a wonderful work. The Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us to make our spirit life (8:10b), to make our mind life (8:6b), and to give life to our mortal body (8:11b).</p>
<h2 class="head1">DRINKING OF THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now that we are indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit, we can drink of the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13b). If the Spirit left us after He sealed us, we would not be able to drink Him. But He remains in us as a fountain. We can drink of Him all the time. To drink the Spirit is to take the Spirit in and have our being saturated with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE SPIRIT AS<br />
THE FIRSTFRUIT OF GOD AS OUR PORTION</h2>
<p>We are also enjoying the Spirit as the firstfruit of God as our portion (Rom. 8:23a). God has allotted Himself to us as our portion. This means that He has given Himself to us as our lot. The indwelling, remaining Spirit is the lot within us today. Now we can enjoy Him. Every believer, to one degree or another, has experienced drinking of the remaining Spirit and enjoying Him. Our favorite foods are very tasty, rich, and satisfying to us. In the same way that we enjoy our favorite foods, we need to enjoy the indwelling God. We drink of Him and we enjoy Him as the firstfruit. The firstfruit means the first taste, and our enjoying of the first taste indicates that the full taste is coming. We are now in the stage of enjoying the firstfruit, which is the fresh Spirit, the fresh consummated Triune God. When the Triune God was consummated, He became the firstfruit to us, and now we are enjoying the fresh consummated God. Many of the Jews will believe in the Lord Jesus when He returns (Zech. 12:10). But by that time the firstfruit will have become the full taste. These Jews will have missed the firstfruit of the Spirit. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we are all tasting the fresh, consummated Triune God today. Our being indwelt by the resurrecting Spirit, drinking of the life-giving Spirit, and enjoying the Spirit as the firstfruit form another group of the organic processes in the Spirit that we experience.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
