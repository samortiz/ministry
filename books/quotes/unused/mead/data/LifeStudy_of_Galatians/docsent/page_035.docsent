   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO GIVE HIMSELF FOR US</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THAT HE MIGHT IMPART LIFE TO US</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND LIVE IN US IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>TO FREE US FROM THE BONDAGE UNDER LAW</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ was crucified in order to give Himself for us that He might impart life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is altogether positive, whereas dealing with sins and rescuing us from the evil age are negative.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the positive side, Christ crucified imparts the divine life to us so that He might live in us in resurrection to free us from bondage under law 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through His death on the cross, Christ released His divine life and imparted the divine life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This makes it possible for Him to live in us in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If Christ had not been crucified, it would not be possible for Him to come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A raw, unprocessed Christ cannot dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before Christ could come into us and live in us, He had to deal with our sins and with our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The old I, the I without God, had to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To deal with sin and with our fallen nature, Christ had to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Dealing with these negative things opened the way for Christ to impart Himself into us as our life and thereby to live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, Christ s living in us is based upon His death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, the Christ who lives in us is a Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If Christ had not been crucified, how could He have been resurrected?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This would, of course, have been impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And if Christ were not in resurrection, He could not live in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The only Christ who can dwell in us is a resurrected Christ, a processed Christ, a Christ who has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The process through which Christ has passed affords Him the ground and the way to enter into us and to live in us in His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A raw Christ could never be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Christ who is our life and who lives in us is the processed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through His crucifixion He dealt with our sins and with our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now, based upon the work accomplished in His crucifixion, He lives in us in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates clearly that the cross is the center of God s operation for the carrying out of His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TO REDEEM US</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>OUT OF THE CURSE OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Galatians 3:13 says, Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf; because it is written, Cursed is every one hanging on a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Christ as our substitute on the cross not only bore the curse for us, but also became a curse for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The curse of the law issued from the sin of man Gen 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christ took away our sin on the cross, He redeemed us out of the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Galatians surely were foolish in going back to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What did they expect to do about the curse of the law?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As descendants of Adam, they were under the curse like everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we read Romans 5, we see that Adam brought us all under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the curse was not altogether official until the law was given.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the law now declares that all the fallen descendants of Adam are under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Galatians 3:13 Paul seemed to be telling the Galatians, The law is not good to you, for it has made the curse official.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The curse brought in by the fall of Adam has been made official by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You are very foolish to return to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The law condemns you and makes your curse official.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But through His crucifixion, Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the cross He was even made a curse for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sin, the evil age, and the curse were all serious problems.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Without the cross of Christ, how could God deal with these problems and carry out His economy?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We certainly need Christ crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need the Christ who has died on the cross to solve all these problems.</S>
