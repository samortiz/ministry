Politics is always alongside religion and culture. According to Matthew&#8217;s presentation, after the rejection by religion and natural knowledge, there is the rejection by politics. Herod the tetrarch represents the rejection by politics. This is the basic principle of 14:1-13.</p><p>Herod had John the Baptist beheaded in prison. In 12:24 the Jewish religious leaders, representing the entire nation of the Jews, rejected the heavenly King to the uttermost. This forced Him to forsake His natural relationship with them (12:46-50). Then in 13:53-58 He was rejected by the Galileans also. Now in chapter fourteen, Matthew, in his arranging of events according to doctrine, unveils to us how Gentile politics treated the King&#8217;s forerunner. It was evil and full of corruption and darkness. To this point Matthew has given a full picture of the Jews&#8217;, the Galileans&#8217;, and the Gentiles&#8217; rejection of the ministry of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><p>In chapter fourteen we see the darkness, rottenness, and injustice in politics. Our eyes need to be opened to see that in religion there is no welcome to our heavenly King. Neither is there a place for Him in natural knowledge nor in today&#8217;s rotten, dark politics. In this generation there is no place for the heavenly King. Religion, culture, and politics are all one in rejecting the heavenly King. How I thank the Lord for the record in the Gospel of Matthew. If you read the chapters prior to fourteen, you will see the deceitfulness in the Jewish religion. You will also see that natural knowledge has caused great damage to people. Furthermore, you will see the rottenness and darkness in Roman politics, which was the leading political system on earth at the time. But even in the best political system there is nothing but rottenness and darkness. (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 510-511)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>13<sup>1</sup> Because He had been rejected by the people in religious, cultured, and political circles, the heavenly King departed from them and withdrew to a deserted place privately. This indicates that thenceforth He would hide Himself in a deserted place, in a place without culture, away from the religious, cultured, and political circles. He did this by means of a boat, implying that He would do this through the church. Because He has been rejected by the civilized world, the Lord, through the church, has always hidden Himself in a realm without much culture, away from religious and political circles.</p><p>13<sup>2</sup> In spite of the rejection by all kinds of people, there were still a large number of people who followed the heavenly King. They did this by leaving their cities. It was not that the King came to their cities to visit them, but that they left their cultured cities to follow Him in a deserted place. Through all the centuries the true followers of Christ have left cultured spheres to follow their heavenly King outside the cultured world.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 510-512; Hymns: #460, #473</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Matthew, Vol. 3 (13:53-21:22) &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
