   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HUMAN VIRTUES FOR A DEGRADED AGE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Paul wrote these three books, the church was degraded, and under that kind of degradation, the need was not mainly for teachings or gifts, but human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that the message of these three books just fits today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are under such a degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is the proper cure for this age?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the proper dose for this generation?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The answer is the proper humanity that comes from the man Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The proper humanity is the only healing power for today's generation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have confidence that the Lord will use the church as a remedy for today's crooked and perverse generation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The remedy for such a generation is a church with the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have the full assurance that if the young people in the church take the humanity of Jesus, they will be the proper remedy for this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not just a matter of shouting, "Hallelujah, Jesus is Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need the humanity of Jesus to back up our shouting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then there will be the manifestation of the humanity of Jesus in the schools, on the jobs, and wherever the brothers and sisters are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There will be the shining of the humanity of Jesus into the darkness of this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul mentions something concerning the matter of humanity in these three books, and he also speaks of human virtues in Philippians 4:8.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"For the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is well-spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is clear that these are all human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He also tells us in this book that we are the children of God as lights shining in this world among a crooked and perverted generation 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Galatians 5:22-23, Paul speaks of the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit here refers to the Spirit of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul does not speak of the fruit of the Spirit of God or the fruit of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the Spirit of Jesus, because all of the items mentioned are human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The things that are mentioned in these verses are not divinely powerful or miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are something of humanity but not of our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These things come forth only from the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose we have two brothers before us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One has a marvelous healing gift, and the other takes the humanity of Jesus to be gentle, meek, joyous, and full of self-control and longsuffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Which of these two brothers would you prefer?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am afraid that many Christians would pay little attention to the one with the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All would admire the one with the healing gift, and he would even be advertised in the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have never seen an advertisement in the newspaper concerning a Christian who is exercising the proper humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul did not say that the fruit of the Spirit is divine healing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Healing is something which is performed outwardly, but gentleness, meekness, and self-control are part of one's being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our being is much more important than our doing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, once said that God pays more attention to what we are than what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Christians pay too much attention to what people do, rather than what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do believe that today in the church life the Lord is going to recover His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We not only need His power; we need His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We not only need what He can do; we need what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I cannot believe that the miraculous gifts are the remedy for today's generation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, the proper humanity shining forth through the young brothers and sisters will be a strong testimony and remedy to this present age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And this humanity will also cause us to have the strongest church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fruit of the Spirit is just the expression of the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE SALT OF THE EARTH AND THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus told us in Matthew 5 that we are the salt of the earth and the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The function of salt is to kill corrupting elements so that things may be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is much corruption on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Everywhere you go you can see the germs of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How we need the salt!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And the basic element of the salt is nothing but the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The humanity of Jesus in our daily walk is the heavenly salt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we live by the humanity of Jesus, the more salty we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>With this humanity, there is the killing power for all the corrupting germs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more we apply, experience, and live by the humanity of Jesus, the more we will be the salt to this corrupted and corrupting generation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, we see what a responsibility we have.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not just a matter of shouting, "Jesus is Lord!" but of being the salt with the salting power.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all need the real transformation that comes from the application of the humanity of Jesus in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Furthermore, the problem today is not only a matter of corruption, but also of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How dark it is today!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I simply do not dare to read the papers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The whole situation is under darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But, hallelujah, the church is the lampstand, and we are the light!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet we can be the light only by taking the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now the importance of the meal offering in Leviticus is apparent.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we come to the last three offerings, we will see that they are based upon the first two.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The burnt offering and the meal offering are the basic offerings, and all the other offerings are built upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But the meal offering is more weighty and even more basic than the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In all spiritual matters the basic structure is the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have already seen nine or ten matters which are produced by the Lord's humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the tabernacle had not had the standing boards, it would have been in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The basic structure of all spiritual things is the humanity of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This humanity is the heavenly salt and the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Without this humanity, the salt loses its flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May the Lord be merciful to us that His humanity may be wrought into our Christian walk and daily living.</S>
