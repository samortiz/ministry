In His Heavenly Ministry</H2><P>The Lord's shepherding is secondly in His heavenly ministry (1 Pet. 5:4) to take care of the church of God, issuing in His Body. When He was on the earth, He was shepherding. After His resurrection and ascension to the heavens, He is still shepherding.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. COMMISSIONING PETER TO FEED HIS LAMBS<br>AND SHEPHERD HIS SHEEP</H2><P>When the Lord stayed with His disciples after His resurrection and before His ascension, in one of His appearings, He commissioned Peter to feed His lambs and shepherd His sheep in His absence, while He is in the heavens (John 21:15-17). Shepherding implies feeding, but it includes much more than feeding. To shepherd is to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Incorporating the Apostolic Ministry<br>with Christ's Heavenly Ministry</H2><P>This is to incorporate the apostolic ministry with Christ's heavenly ministry to take care of God's flock, which is the church that issues in the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Words of the Apostle Paul<br>concerning Shepherding</H2><P>The following words of the apostle Paul confirm this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Elders' Shepherding the Church of God</H2><P>In Acts 20:28 Paul told the elders of Ephesus, "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers to shepherd the church of God, which He obtained [or, purchased] through His own blood." Although Paul was on an urgent trip back to Jerusalem, while he was journeying he sent word for the elders in Ephesus to come to him. Then he gave them a long word recorded in Acts 20.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Fierce Wolves Not Sparing the Flock</H2><P>Paul said that "fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock" (Acts 20:29). The flock is the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Great Shepherd of the Sheep</H2><P>Paul said in Hebrews 13:20, "God...brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, in the blood of an eternal covenant." The eternal covenant is the covenant of the new testament to gain a flock, which is the church issuing in the Body and consummating the New Jerusalem. The eternal covenant of God is to consummate the New Jerusalem by the shepherding. God raised up our Lord from the dead to be the great Shepherd to consummate the New Jerusalem according to God's eternal covenant.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_075.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_077.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crystallization-Study of the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 76</div><br></body></html>
