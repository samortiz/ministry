<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TRIALS OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Job 2</H1><P>In this message we will continue to consider the trials of Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. A COUNCIL HELD AGAIN<br>IN HEAVEN CONCERNING JOB</H2><P>A council was held again in heaven concerning Job (2:1). It was not easy for God to gain a person like Job who feared God and turned away from evil. Yet what Job had attained was altogether vanity. It did not fulfill God's purpose, and it did not satisfy God's desire. Thus, God was lovingly concerned for Job and held two councils in heaven concerning how to deal with Job (1:6-8; 2:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Held by God with the Angels</H2><P>The second council was also held by God with the angels, the sons of God (v. 1a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Satan Coming Again as One of the Attendants</H2><P>Satan came again as one of the attendants, presenting himself before God (v. 1b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. God's Checking with Satan concerning Job</H2><P>In verses 2 through 6 we see that again God checked with Satan concerning Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. God's Question and Satan's Answer</H2><P>Jehovah said to Satan, "Where have you come from?" Satan answered Jehovah, saying, "From roving the earth and going about in it" (v. 2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. God Asking Satan concerning Job</H2><P>According to verse 3, Jehovah said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil. And he still holds fast his integrity, though you have moved Me against him to destroy him without cause." Here God admitted that what was done to Job was without cause.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Satan Saying That All That a Man Has<br>He Will Give for the Sake of His Life</H2><P>Satan answered Jehovah, saying, "Skin for skin! Indeed all that a man has he will give for the sake of his life. But stretch forth Your hand, and touch his bone and his flesh; and he will surely curse You to Your face" (vv. 4-5). Apparently, Satan was challenging God. Actually, Satan said exactly what God wanted, and God was pleased with it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Jehovah Telling Satan That<br>Job Was in His Hand</H2><P>Jehovah told Satan that Job was in his hand. Only Satan was to spare Job's life (v. 6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. God Restricting Satan<br>in the Limit of His Permission</H2><P>Satan, in his cruel nature, would attack God's lovers to any extent to damage them, if God did not draw a line to preserve His lovers for their existence that they might gain Him to the fullest extent for His fullest satisfaction. The Bible shows us that although after God judged Satan, God still allowed him to be free to accuse, attack, damage, persecute, and martyr His saints that God may use him to a certain extent for the fulfillment of God's particular purpose, God always restricts him in the limit of His permission.</P>
