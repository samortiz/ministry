to the Triune God through the Lesson Books,<br />
Which Are Based on the Bible</h2>
<p>In the Summer School of Truth our textbook is the Bible, and all our lesson books are based on the Bible. Our goal is to bring the young people not to the lesson books but to bring them to the Triune God through the lesson books. Our lesson books should be a channel through which the young people are brought to the Triune God. If you realize this, then you will also realize that it is not sufficient merely to teach your class with the lesson book as if you were teaching in a secular school. Everyone in your class should gain the Triune God. Do not bring the young people to the lesson book&mdash;bring them to the Triune God through the lesson book. The lesson book is a channel for those whom you are serving to be brought to God and to gain God. This means that your aim is not to teach the lesson book but to bring the young people to God through the channel of the lesson book. This is the nature of the Summer School of Truth.</p>
<p>Through your teaching, your serving, in the Summer School of Truth, everyone in your class should be brought to God. You need to pray and endeavor concerning this. You need to labor to bring every young person in your class to the Triune God, so that by the time you have finished all the lessons, the students in your class will have gained the Triune God and will have been filled with God, not with mere knowledge about God in letters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUENESS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We have seen that our textbook is the Bible. Now we need to consider further what the Bible is. Apparently the Bible is the same as any other book&mdash;a composition of words. Whereas all secular books are the same in nature, the Bible is different from other books. The Bible is unique.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Holy Breath</h2>
<p>I would like to point out again that 2 Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; The Scriptures are the breath of God, or the breathing out of God, God&rsquo;s breathing out of Himself. The Bible, therefore, is God&rsquo;s breath, and God&rsquo;s breath is the Spirit of God, for God is Spirit (John 4:24). The Greek word for <em>Spirit</em> is <em>pneuma,</em> which is also the word for <em>breath.</em> Thus, we may say that the Holy Spirit is the holy breath (cf. 20:22). God is Spirit, and the Spirit is the holy breath. To say that all Scripture is God-breathed is to say that the Bible is the breath, the breathing out, of the very God who is Spirit. God has breathed Himself out, and this breathing out of God is the Bible. This is what 2 Timothy 3:16 is saying when it tells us that the Scriptures are God-breathed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spirit and Life</h2>
<p>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The word that proceeds out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus is spirit, <em>pneuma.</em> His words are the embodiment of the Spirit, who gives life. This indicates that the word which comes out of the Lord&rsquo;s mouth is His breath, the breathing out of Himself. This is a further indication that the words of the Scriptures are God-breathed.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sword of the Spirit</h2>
<p>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul charges us to receive &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; The antecedent of <em>which</em> is <em>Spirit,</em> not <em>sword,</em> indicating that the Spirit is the word of God. When we read the Bible, we must touch the word of God as the Spirit. Along with 2 Timothy 3:16 and John 6:63, this verse reveals that the Bible is God&rsquo;s breathing out. Since God is Spirit, what He breathes out must also be Spirit. The words of the Bible, therefore, are the breathing out of God Himself as the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROFITABLE FOR TEACHING, CONVICTION,<br />
CORRECTION, AND INSTRUCTION IN RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 3:16 says not only that the Scriptures are God-breathed but also that the Scriptures are &ldquo;profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&rdquo; On God&rsquo;s side the Bible is God&rsquo;s breathing. On our side the Bible is for us to receive profit in four matters&mdash; teaching, conviction or reproof, correction, and instruction. The order here is significant. Why does teaching and not instruction come first? Why does correction come before instruction and reproof before correction? And why does teaching come first? The order is first teaching and then reproof, correction, and instruction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Teaching&mdash;the Rolling Away of the Veil</h2>
<p>What is teaching? How do you understand the word <em>teaching?</em> We need to know the denotation of this word as it is used by Paul.</p>
<p>If we have the proper and adequate spiritual experience, we will realize that in verse 16 teaching equals revelation. Teaching is actually nothing less than a divine revelation. Since teaching equals revelation, as you are teaching the young people in your class in the Summer School of Truth, you must present a revelation to them.</p>
<p>A revelation is the opening of a veil. As you are teaching the young people, you should be taking away a veil so that they may see something of the Triune God. A certain matter may be hidden from view, but by your teaching you should gradually open the veil. This is teaching.</p>
<p>When you are serving in the Summer School of Truth, you should not allow the veil to remain over the eyes of the young people. Rather, as they are listening to you, the veil should be rolled away little by little. To teach is to roll away the veil. Go to the summer school for the purpose of rolling away the veil.</p>
<p>Now we can see that for the Bible to be profitable for teaching means that it is profitable for unveiling, for rolling away the veil. A veil cannot be taken away suddenly; it cannot be rolled away all at once. On the contrary, the veil is rolled away a little at a time. Time after time and in session after session, you need gradually to roll away the veil. If you do this, your way of teaching will be an unveiling. This kind of teaching always presents a revelation to others. Those who are under such teaching will be able to see something concerning the Triune God.</p>
<p>This understanding of teaching applies not only to those who teach in the Summer School of Truth but to all those who speak for the Lord. When you speak something in the church meeting, your speaking should be the rolling away of the veil. This means that your speaking should present a revelation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> </body></html>
