But the next station is the battlefield. It is after the valley of the shadow of death that you are qualified and equipped for fighting. Allow me to say that however living and active you are now, I can have no trust in you. You need to pass the test; you need to pass through the valley of the shadow of death. The potters, after making certain objects of clay, place them in an oven to be burnt. There is a great difference between vessels of clay which have been burnt and those which have not. The valley of the shadow of death is the place for us to be burnt. After this experience we are qualified and equipped to fight the battle.<p>But on the battlefield, praise the Lord, there is a table set before us. &#8220;Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies&#8221; (v. 5). The fighting on the battlefield is the feasting. While we are fighting, we are feasting. We may tell the enemy, &#8220;Send your armies; all your armies will be the courses of our feast.&#8221; The Old Testament tells us that even the enemies are our food (Num. 14:9). For us Christians, the enemies are the best food. This is a table, a table spread with many courses. And this is not all. It is here on the battlefield that we experience the anointing of our head with oil and our cup running over. It is really so. In our experiences, the more we are on the battlefield fighting for the Lord, the more we sense that we are under the anointing, that we are feasting and our cup is running over. It is really good. But still this is not all.<p>Now we come to the last station. Hallelujah! &#8220;Surely goodness and lovingkindness shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever&#8221; (v. 6). What is this? It is at this point that we are settled in the local church. The Psalmist did not say that he would pass through the house of the Lord, but that he would dwell in the house of the Lord. Some Christians conceive of this as going one day to heaven. After passing through all the courses on earth, they think, they will die and go to heaven, where they will dwell in the house of the Lord. Do you believe that this scripture means that? If you could go to David, the author of this Psalm, he would tell you that this is absolute nonsense. David expected to dwell in the house of the Lord on this earth.<p>You may say that now you are in the local church. Yes, you are in the local church, but let me illustrate the real situation to you from my experience. I have been in the local church for forty years, but I can testify that my being in the local church today is different from my being there forty years ago. Forty years ago I was not so deeply settled in the local church, but today I am deeply settled. Not one who is reading this book can remove me from the local church. I am dwelling in the house of the Lord. I can hear some of you saying, &#8220;Hallelujah, I am so happy I am in the local church!&#8221; But after six months you may say, &#8220;It is not so good as it used to be; I&#8217;m not so happy.&#8221; Eventually you may even say, &#8220;This local church is not what I thought it was; I&#8217;m going to give it up.&#8221; An infant tree which has been planted only two weeks ago is easily plucked up. But after a tree has been growing for forty years, a giant bulldozer would be required to remove it. Praise the Lord, I am really settled in the house of the Lord. I do not care whether the house of the Lord seems to be wonderful or miserable-I am just here. You may think today that you are settled in the house of the Lord, but you are not so settled. You need time to pass the test, time to grow, time to let your roots be deeply implanted. The shepherding of the resurrected Christ is to lead us into the local churches, to lead us into the house of the Lord forever. It is here that goodness and lovingkindness follow us all the days of our life.<p>This is the last station. We start with the green pastures, and we end with the house of the Lord; in between we have the paths of righteousness, the valley of the shadow of death, and the battlefield. This is Psalm 23; it shows us how the resurrected Christ shepherds us, leading us into the house of God. It is really good! But this is not all.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
