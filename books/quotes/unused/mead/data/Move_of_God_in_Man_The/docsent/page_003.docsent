   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this series of messages, we want to see the move of God in man, which is God's history in His union with man in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In a previous series of messages entitled The History of God in His Union with Man, we have seen God's move in the Old Testament from Genesis through Leviticus.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God moved with men and among men in the Old Testament, but He never moved in man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we touch this matter, we have to be careful because in the Old Testament we do have some hints concerning God's appearing to people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God appeared to Abraham in Genesis 18 in the form of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One day Abraham was sitting in front of his tent when three men came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Two of them were angels and the other was Jehovah, the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, in Genesis 18 not only God but also the angels appeared in the form of men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Abraham prepared water for Jehovah to wash His feet and Sarah prepared a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows that God's appearing to man and God's relationship with man are very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in principle we need to see that God did not move in man in the Old Testament; He moved only with men and among men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was not until the age of the New Testament that God came to move on this earth in man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His first step to move in the New Testament age was to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God took a definite step to enter into man, and this laid a foundation for His move in man throughout the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God entered into the womb of a human virgin and stayed there for nine months to be born of that virgin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This was His move to enter into man as a foundation for His further move in man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Old Testament was a preparation for God's move in man in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Strictly speaking, in the Old Testament God's move was among men and through men but not in man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the New Testament age came, God's entire way changed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was in the Old Testament working all the time with men and among men but outside of men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Samson is a good illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Samson was very strong and full of the power of God but his personal life was a mess.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that God's move in the Old Testament was outside of man and not something of an inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Testament is different from the Old Testament in the one fact that God entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was born of man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 1:20 says that what was begotten in Mary was of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God was born in Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One day God came out of eternity with His divinity and entered into a human virgin's womb to be born there.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have been studying the Bible for many years, and through my study I have come to the conclusion that there are ten main items in the eternal economy of God revealed in the twenty-seven books of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first five items are the steps of God's move, and the last five items are the issues of God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the eternal economy of God in the New Testament, there are five steps and five issues of God's move in man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The five steps are incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are the steps that God took in His move in man on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was incarnated in man, and He lived in man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In incarnation He entered into the womb of Mary and remained there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After His birth He passed through a human living of thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then He went to the cross to be crucified in man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus was crucified on the cross as a man but He was not just a man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He rose up from the dead in man and ascended to the heavens in man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>These are the five steps of His move.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The five issues of these steps are the church, the Body of Christ, the new man, the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These five steps and five issues cover the entire New Testament concerning the move of God in man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first page of the New Testament is on incarnation, and the last page of the New Testament is on the New Jerusalem.</S>
