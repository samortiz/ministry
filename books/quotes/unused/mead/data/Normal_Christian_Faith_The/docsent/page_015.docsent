   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ONLY BOOK THAT MEETS ALL FOUR CONDITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After searching through all the books, you have to come finally to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If God desires to communicate with man, and if He does so through writing, then this is the only book that can pass the four tests.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, this must be the book God has for man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does this book say?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the books of the law in the Old Testament, it says, "Thus saith the Lord," at least five hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Other books in the Old Testament repeat the phrase about seven hundred times.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition to the references in the New Testament to the speakings of God, the Bible has more than two thousand claims of divine origin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If God has no intention of communicating with man, we can forget about this book.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if He does communicate with man through writing, then this book has to be of immense value.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Can you find another book where God is claimed as its author that many times?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to see if the Bible meets the second qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Let us take a look at its moral tone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Everyone who has studied this book confesses that it carries the highest moral standard.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even the sins of the most noble persons are recorded and condemned without mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once a strong opposer of the Bible was asked by his son, "Why are you so strong against the Bible?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He answered, "If I do not condemn it, it will condemn me."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This book does not let us get by easily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The human concept is that all sexual acts outside marriage are considered as fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible, however, says that even an evil thought is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Human morality condemns an act of killing as murder, but the Bible condemns a slight hatred in the heart as murder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We consider a man who lets his enemy get by without paying vengeance as forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Bible charges man to love his enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How high is its moral tone, and how low we are before its standards!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You cannot help but admit that it presents the best ethical code for humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>PAST AND FUTURE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, this book describes in detail the past and future of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once a friend told me that he could believe in everything the Bible says except the parts in Genesis and Revelation where it talks about the origin and destiny of the heavens and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I told him that if this is indeed a book from God, it must, of necessity, contain these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the Bible did not contain Genesis and Revelation, it would be the same as any other book, and we would have to look for another book; it would not be the one we want.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the past condition of the world and its future destiny are recorded here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the third qualification is also met.</S>
