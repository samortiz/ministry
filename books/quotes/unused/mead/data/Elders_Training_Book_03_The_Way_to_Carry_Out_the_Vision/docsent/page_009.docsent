   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECOND CORINTHIANS 3:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we want to see something further concerning 2 Corinthians 3:17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Most of us have probably been contented with our interpretation of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The traditional teachings avoid saying that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They say that the Lord in 2 Corinthians 3:17 does not refer to Jesus Christ, but that it is a general address referring to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have argued in the past that according to the context of this section which starts at 2:12, the Lord here must refer to Christ the Lord 2:12, 14, 15, 17; 3:3, 4, 14, 16; 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the context of 2 Corinthians 2 through 4 there is no other way to interpret 2 Corinthians 3:17 but to acknowledge that the Lord in this verse is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I studied this verse further, I realized that it is in the functional sense that the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to see that what is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:17 is a matter of function, we must take care of the context of this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Darby indicates that verse 7 through verse 16 of chapter three is a parenthetical section.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With this understanding as a basis, verse 17 is a direct continuation of verse 6 which ends with the word the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 6 tells us what kind of Spirit the Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Life-giving is a function.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 17 also tells us that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Freedom refers to the work of freeing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Life-giving is a function and freeing is also a function.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the following verse, verse 18, tells us that we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse we see the transforming function of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These are the three main functions of the Spirit in chapter three life-giving, freeing, and transforming.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In such functions, Christ today is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows us that we should not be contented with whatever understanding we have of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must realize that the holy Word is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a big mine which no one can exhaust.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even though I have presented something more concerning Isaiah 9:6 and 2 Corinthians 3:17 there is still more concerning these two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who can say that he has exhausted any verse or any point in the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Bible is too profound.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>JOHN 6:57</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I want to give you another illustration of how we should never be contented with what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 6:57 the Lord tells us, he who eats Me shall also live because of Me. A few hymns in our hymnal tell us that eating is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must ask ourselves what the eating way is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How do we eat Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In my writings I have only given you a small amount of information on this subject.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because I did not give you an adequate definition of the way to eat Jesus, you must study this point.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To fully understand this point you must take care of the entire context of John 6:57.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 63 the Lord says, It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that to eat Jesus is to receive Him into us as life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This corresponds with the principle of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eating is to receive some organic nourishment into your being as your life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eating is to take in the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some might say that it is heretical to say that people can eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible, however, says to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must realize that to eat Jesus is a figure of speech.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It indicates that we need Jesus as our life supply so we receive Him into us as life supply just as we eat food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord uses bread to illustrate that He is the life supply by saying that He is the bread of life John 6:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We eat bread by receiving it into our organic body, by digesting it into our blood, fibers and tissue.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, to eat Jesus is to receive Him into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is the Spirit and the Spirit is in the Word, so we have to take His Word by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we receive the Spirit in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is Jesus becoming our inner life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we could see the way to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Chapter six of John also indicates the Lord s death, that is, His being slain.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 54 tells us that His blood is drinkable and that His flesh is eatable.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here flesh and blood are mentioned separately.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When blood is separate from flesh, it indicates death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This helps us further to see how to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To eat Jesus means to receive the crucified and resurrected Christ through His Word by exercising our spirit to receive the life-giving Spirit as our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The way to carry out the vision is by taking care of the crucial points, by taking care of the outline, the bird s-eye view, and by never being contented.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Go on and on to further study and further seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I hope that you would do this work.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do not wait for me to do it.</S>
