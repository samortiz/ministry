<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS OF REGENERATION, THE BRASS SERPENT, AND THE BRIDE</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 3:1-8, 9-16, 22-36</h1><p>In chapter three there are three signs: regeneration, the brass serpent, and the bride. In the foregoing message we covered the sign of regeneration. In this message we shall consider the signs of the brass serpent and the bride.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST TYPIFIED BY THE BRASS SERPENT</h2><p>John 3:14 says, “And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.” Here the Lord refers to what happened in Numbers 21:4-9. Numbers 21:5 says, “The people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.” Here we see that the children of Israel complained and were rebellious. As a result, “the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died” (Num. 21:6). Then the people came to Moses and confessed that they had sinned in speaking against the Lord and against him. They asked Moses to pray that the Lord would take away the serpents from them. When Moses prayed for the people, the Lord said to him, “Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live” (v. 8). We are told that Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole. Then “it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived” (v. 9).<p>The children of Israel who were bitten by serpents died— it was not merely a case of their becoming ill. Therefore, they needed not only to be healed, but to be enlivened, to be made alive again. In the sight of God the rebellious Israelites had become serpents, and those evil serpents were condemned and rejected by God. In order for the children of Israel to be rescued, it was necessary for them to be judged. They needed a substitute to bear this judgment for them. They were all serpents, and there was the need of a serpent to become their substitute to be judged by God for them. This was the reason the Lord told Moses to make a brass serpent and put it on a pole. That substitute serpent was not to have any poison. If that brass serpent had the poison of a real serpent, it could not have been a substitute for the serpentine people. The serpent used as a substitute had to be clean, without poison. The brass serpent had the form of a real serpent, but it did not have any serpentine poison. The Lord told Moses to lift up this brass serpent on a pole and have the serpent-bitten children of Israel look at it. Whoever looked upon this brass serpent that was judged in place of the children of Israel could live.<p>This incident in Numbers 21 was sovereignly prepared by God to reveal a particular type of Christ. The brass serpent lifted up on a pole in Numbers 21 is a type of Christ lifted up on the cross for us as the Son of Man according to John 3:14. As descendants of Adam, we all have been “bitten” by the old serpent, the Devil. Therefore, we are all serpentine beings with the poison of the old serpent in our nature. In the sight of God, the entire fallen human race consists of poisonous serpents. Furthermore, all these serpents are dead. We as dead serpents need a substitute, someone with the form of a serpent but without the poisonous element of the serpent. This substitute, of course, is Christ.<p>According to Romans 8:3, God sent His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin and condemned sin in the flesh. This corresponds to the revelation in John 3 concerning the brass serpent. For God to send His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin means that Christ became a serpent in form, that is, a brass serpent without the serpentine poison. Furthermore, Paul’s word in Romans 8:3 about God condemning sin in the flesh indicates that the old serpent has been condemned so that the problem of sin may be solved. Now whoever believes in Christ as the One who was lifted up to be condemned in our place has eternal life. This is the significance of the type of the brass serpent in John 3:14.<p>In his conversation with Nicodemus, the Lord spoke to him concerning the brass serpent. The Lord seemed to be saying, “Nicodemus, you ask me how it is possible to be born again. You are a teacher of Israel. You have taught the people from the five books written by Moses. Did you never tell them about the story in Numbers 21? Certainly you must have taught this. Don’t you know that the matter of the brass serpent in Numbers 21 is related to regeneration? As Moses lifted up the brass serpent on the pole, so the Son of Man must be lifted up.” The Lord was indicating to Nicodemus that He was the fulfillment of the type of the brass serpent.<p>It was as the Son of Man that Christ was lifted up on the cross to be judged in our behalf. This means that He was lifted up not as the Creator, but as a creature, even as a creature that was in the form of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). Some teachers may deny the fact that Christ with respect to His humanity is a creature. But the Bible clearly reveals that Christ became a creature, and even a creature in the form of the flesh of sin, for He took upon Himself the likeness of the flesh of sin. In typology, this is signified by the brass serpent. According to the type of the brass serpent, when Christ was lifted up on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin typified by the form of the brass serpent, but He did not have the nature of sin typified by the poisonous nature of the serpent.<p>Certain opposers have spread the evil rumor that I teach that Christ had a sinful nature. I have never taught that the Lord Jesus had a sinful nature. However, according to Numbers 21, John 3:14, Romans 8:3, and 2 Corinthians 5:21, I do teach that the Lord Jesus became flesh in the form, the likeness, of the flesh of sin, but not having the nature of sin. According to the Bible, I teach that Christ was made sin for us; that is, He took upon Himself the likeness of the flesh of sin and died upon the cross in that flesh.
