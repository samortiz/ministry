These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo
They lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation
The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God
We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible
Creation is a proof of a creating God: 'The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the expanse proclaims the work of His hands'
Every reasonable man should confess and believe that there is a God when he sees the things in the universe and the order in the universe
God not only reveals Himself through His creation in the universe, but He also explains and reveals Himself through His speaking
We do not need to conduct research or guess concerning these matters, because He has clearly revealed them to us through the Bible
God has not only revealed Himself in the creation of the universe and in His speaking, but He has also come through His incarnation
The God who revealed Himself through His creation and His speaking has manifested Himself through His incarnation
Prior to His incarnation He revealed Himself to man, but through His incarnation He has manifested Himself to man
Following the death and resurrection of Christ, He came as the Spirit to enter into man, mingle with man, and be obtained by man
He went through this process in order to have a close, personal relationship with man and to be man's life, salvation, and everything
Christ not only is in us, but He also wants to live in us and to grow and be formed in us so that we may be conformed to His glorious image
These four steps are the creation of all things, the revelation in the Bible, incarnation, and transfiguration as the Spirit
The incarnation manifested God to man, and His transfiguration as the Spirit allows God to enter into man and be obtained by man
He is revealed by the creation, explained by the Bible, manifested by incarnation, and made available as the Spirit
We must have a clear understanding concerning creation, the Bible, Christ, and the Holy Spirit in order to have a thorough knowledge of God
If we lack understanding of such matters, it should not be a surprise that we cannot understand such a mysterious person as God
According to the record of the Bible, the plural references to God point to the number three, and the singular references, to the number one
Although the Lord's word to the Father clearly contains the plural pronoun We, it also clearly indicates that the 'We' are one
God commanded the Old Testament priests to speak the name Jehovah three times in succession when they blessed the children of Israel
They were not charged to say 'Jehovah' two times or even four times; God charged them to speak the name three times
According to the Old Testament, the priests referred to Jehovah three times in succession when they blessed the people
The name of God the Father, the kingdom of God the Son, and the will of God the Spirit can be seen in other portions of the Bible as well
Consequently, the prayer that the Lord charged the New Testament believers to pray also proves that God is triune
The Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation of God to man, and the Spirit is the realization of God, the entrance of God into man
If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
In verse 3, Peter told Ananias that he had deceived the Holy Spirit, and in the following verse he equated this with lying to God
If we believe that the child born to us is the Mighty God, we must also believe that the Son given to us is the Eternal Father
Because the Triune God is a mystery, our limited mentality cannot completely understand the Triune God as a doctrine
Because His heart is love, He desires to save men, He is willing to save men, and He does not want men to perish
For our sake, He judged the Lord Jesus according to His standard of righteousness to satisfy His righteous requirement
When we believe in the Lord Jesus, receive Him, and are joined to Him, God must justify us according to His righteousness
The words that God speaks to us in the Bible are not ordinary words or promises; they are a covenant He has established with us
Because God's nature, His essence, is holy, He wants us to be holy, to be separated from everything other than Him
Moses and the children of Israel saw the glory of God settling on Mount Sinai, and Ezekiel saw the glory of God
Man replaced God with idols, but Psalm 106:20 and Romans 1:23 both say that man replaced God's glory with idols
Jehovah means 'He who is, who was, and who is coming,' or 'the One who existed, exists, and will exist eternally'
In His name, it is as if there is a blank after 'I am,' which can be filled in by faith with whatever man needs
Jesus in Greek is equivalent to the Hebrew name Joshua ; it means 'Jehovah Savior' or 'the salvation of Jehovah'
The Lord Jesus is Jehovah who is in a relationship with man, who comes to be man's Savior, and who becomes man's salvation
Those who know God will be strong to expand their horizons and extend their boundaries and break new ground for God
They approve of earning money, entertainment, and many other things of the human life, but they do not approve of knowing God
Worldly people are not the only ones who are like this; many Christians do not approve of knowing God in their full knowledge
Only those who want and love God, and who want and love God to the extent of being captured by Him, can know God
A newborn child spits out bitter things that are put into his mouth, and he will eat sweet things that are put into his mouth
He can differentiate between what is bitter and what is sweet by the function of life, not by knowledge that comes from teaching
We must regard the word of God as our spiritual thermometer and let God's word be the deciding factor in knowing God
If we count the knowledge of God and of the Lord as something excellent, we must be willing to suffer the loss of all things for it
Although the love and grace of God are sweet, they do not contain an intrinsic guarantee that the love and grace of God must be provided
His faithfulness requires Him to not go against His word, and His righteousness requires Him to not be unrighteous in His actions
His faithfulness requires Him to act according to His word, and His righteousness requires Him to do things according to a legal standard
When Psalm 89 speaks of God making a covenant with David, it speaks of the love of God and the faithfulness of God
It is difficult for man to grasp with assurance the love that is in God's heart, but he can grasp God's faithfulness through His word
In contrast to us, however, God is never bankrupt and never changes; consequently, His faithfulness is eternally reliable
When a man speaks an important word, he must point to and base his word on something in order for people to have confidence in his oath
He has spoken this word to us, and He has established it as a covenant with us based upon the redemption accomplished by the Lord Jesus
According to this word, when we confess our sins to Him, His faithfulness forces Him to forgive us of our sins
May your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
If we believe in God because of His faithfulness and grasp the word of God, we will be filled, satisfied, and strong
He who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son'
If we do not believe the word that God has spoken in the Bible, we make God a liar and offend the faithfulness of God
God has given us His faithful word, and it pleases Him when we believe His word and hold Him accountable to it
God's being is related to His word and is a matter of faithfulness; God's throne is related to His actions and is a matter of righteousness
If He were unrighteous, the foundation of His throne would be overturned, and everything in the universe would be in chaos
The Lord Jesus did not know sin, so according to God's righteousness, He did not have to receive God's punishment
According to the righteousness of God, God's judgment was carried out because of the sins that Christ bore and because He was made sin
Because the Lord Jesus received the righteous judgment of God on our behalf, He also satisfied God's righteous requirement for us
The gospel of God is powerful and can save everyone who believes it because the gospel is based on the righteousness of God
The grace of God can come to us with authority because it has passed through the procedure of God's righteousness
According to God's act in righteously judging the Lord Jesus on our behalf, He must forgive us because of His righteousness
Just as the righteousness of God requires Him to forgive us because of the redemption of the Lord Jesus, it also requires Him to cleanse us
He exercised forbearance under the old covenant and justifies the believers under the new covenant because He is righteous
Man needs only to believe in the blood that has been shed by the Lord Jesus for him, according to God's righteousness
The vicarious death of the Lord Jesus satisfied every demand and fulfilled every requirement that God's righteousness placed on us
The righteousness of God is given to all those who believe through the faith of Jesus Christ; it is obtained by man through faith
The Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have laid hold of righteousness, but a righteousness which is out of faith'
Although the Gentiles did not pursue the righteousness of the law, they obtained the righteousness of God by faith in Christ
All the responsibility for our standing before God rests upon these two matters; they are like two hands that bear us before God
These two matters were accomplished by God in eternity past before the foundation of the world and before the ages
He has a will and a taste that are according to His good pleasure, and He chose us according to His will and His taste
The purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works but of Him who calls'; 'He has mercy on whom He wills'
Some may think that God chose Jacob because He knew that Jacob would be better than his brother Esau, but this is wrong
His mercy reaches us, raises us up from our position of unworthiness, and makes us worthy to enjoy His love and receive His grace
Since God predestinated us to be the brothers of His Son, He also predestinated us unto sonship through His Son
Consider your calling, brothers, that there are not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many wellborn
God mainly selects those who are foolish, weak, lowborn, despised, and of no account so that no flesh may boast before Him
Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him'?
Although it is difficult, in every age there are some rich people who are willing to become poor out of their love for God
As many as were appointed to eternal life believed'; 'Since you thrust away and do not judge yourselves worthy of eternal life'
The proof of one's predestination is his willingness to believe and receive the gospel of God when he hears it
Moody's teaching on predestination in class, was impressed but did not dare to preach the gospel, because he had a problem
Any doubts that we may have concerning the gracious calling and selection of God come from our lack of pursuing the Lord
It is a matter of God's heart's desire from eternity past, and it is the goal of God's work throughout the ages
The first time the Bible speaks of man, it speaks of man being created in God's image and according to His likeness
Consequently, He created man in His own image and likeness so that man would be like Him in order to be joined to Him
God wanted man to be like Him not only according to outward likeness but also according to inward image especially in mind emotion and will
Even though God was joined with man in the person of Jesus Christ, He could not enter into other men and be joined with them
As the transfiguration of God, the Lord Jesus came among men, and as the transfiguration of God, the Spirit enters into man
Since the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, Christ, who became the Spirit, is abiding in us and is joined with us
When we confess Him and receive Him, we gain God through the Holy Spirit who abides in us and is joined with us
He wants to be joined with us to such an extent that He is formed within us according to the fullness of His image
On the one hand He lives in us to cause us to live out His image and on the other He operates in us to cause us to fulfill His good pleasure
In eternity future, in the new heaven and new earth, the tabernacle, or the dwelling place of God, will be among men
He will be joined with us, the redeemed ones from all the ages, to abide in us forever on a grand and open scale
At this time His eternal heart's desire will be fulfilled, and the goal of His work throughout the ages will be attained
Throughout eternity future, the almighty God and the Lamb, Christ, are the center of the New Jerusalem as the temple of God
Many believers have some knowledge of what He accomplished in His work, but they do not have a clear understanding of His person
When we ask about the person of our glorious, precious, and lovely Lord, many are not able to give a clear answer
All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being'
Although the Lord Jesus is the eternal God and the Creator in time, He became flesh; that is, He became a man through human birth
In eternity He could not be seen or contacted as God, but in time, when He became flesh, He could be seen and contacted
Isaiah 9:6 tells us that when the Lord Jesus was born as a man, He was both the Son given to us and the Eternal Father
On the one hand, when the Lord was on earth, He was the Son of Man born of man, and on the other hand, He was the Son of God
From now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power'; 'Designated the Son of God in power
Following the Lord's resurrection from the dead, He was still the Son of Man, even though He was also designated the Son of God in power
The Lord responded, 'You have said rightly' , but then He said that they would see Him as the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power
When Stephen was martyred after the Lord's ascension, he saw Him as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God
The blood is the foundation upon which we receive all grace and blessing; therefore, it occupies an important position in the Bible
Establishing a covenant is the same as making a contract that explains and guarantees the actions of two parties
Christ received God's punishment on our behalf and satisfied the righteous requirement that God placed on us as sinners
The blood of Christ is the foundation of the new covenant that God established with us, and it is eternally effective
All the grace and blessings given to us by God are included in the new covenant and are given to us in the execution of the new covenant
Since the Lord's blood causes us to turn from sin and purchases us back to God, it separates us and sanctifies us
When the Lord's blood took away our sins before God, the Lord made peace with us and with all things, reconciling us and all things to God
Because the Lord's blood washed us of our sins, it enabled us to obtain God's holy life, which is God Himself as the eternal life
In ancient times the blood of Abel cried out to God from the ground, asking God to avenge him ; thus, his blood asked God to condemn
The law of God condemns us because of our sins, and even the devil can condemn us before God because of our sins
Believers break bread together and fellowship with one another because we all have received the redemption of the Lord's blood
When we cast out demons and fight spiritual battles, we need to rely on the Lord's blood to overcome Satan's authority of darkness
The Lords blood enables us to obtain life and maintain our living before God therefore in the Bible God ordained that we not eat any blood
Man cannot fulfill the law or keep the commandments of the law, because he is fleshly, and the law and its commandments are spiritual
In the beginning the law was not part of God's original ordination for man, that is, something according to God's eternal heart's desire
God then called Abraham out of rebellious mankind and promised to bless him by dealing with him according to grace
Four hundred and thirty years later, God gave the law to man in order to temporarily deal with man according to the law
God did not use the law to deal with man from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, a period of about two thousand five hundred years
The law ended with the coming of the Lord Jesus, which was the beginning of the age of grace and the end of the law
They said to Moses, You speak with us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak with us, so we do not die'
The Israelites were frightened by the thunder flashes of lightning the sound of the trumpet flames thick clouds and the mountain shaking
In God's way of dealing with man, the law was added along the way because of man's transgressions so that man's offense might abound
God did not give the law in order for the children of Israel to keep it; rather, He gave it because He knew that they would break it
Even while the law was being given and even before it was received by the children of Israel, they were trespassing and breaking it
The law was added to expose man's transgressions, so the function of the law is to give man the knowledge of sin
Without the law, man would not know what sin is, but with the law, man knows not only what sin is but also what sins he has committed
Speaks to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may fall under the judgment of God'
Since the law exposes man's sin, it stops man's mouth, making him unable to say anything, and it makes him submit to the judgment of God
With the law, man is willing to condemn himself and confess that he is a sinner who should receive God's judgment
God came in and gave the law to expose man's transgressions so that man would know that he is a sinner and thus know himself
Since the law causes man to know that he is a sinner, it causes man to look to God for His grace and to believe in Christ
The law places demands on the flesh to expose the corruption and impotence of the flesh so that man can know the flesh
Although the law can cause man to know sin and to know himself, it has only this function on the negative side
According to the preceding passages of the Bible, we should know that God has no intention for man to keep the law
Because of the influence of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man thought that God wanted him to keep the law
Grace could make Paul into an apostle and could enable him to do things that others could not, because it is the powerful life of God
The highest grace that God gives to man, the highest grace that man receives from God, is the life of God Himself
According to the context of these verses, good pleasure refers to what God purposed before the foundation the world
Unto the economy of the fullness of the times to head up all things in Christ the things in the heavens and the things on the earth in Him
To the one who does not work, but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted as righteousness'
The law is out of works and under the principle of works; grace is out of faith and under the principle of faith
In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace'
Grace enables us to leave sadness and hopelessness behind and to be boastful in the hope of obtaining God's glory
We are boasting and hopeful, not sorrowful and hopeless, because grace brings us into the glory of God so that we can become glorious people
The word of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who have been sanctified'
Grace not only saves us but also builds us up so that we would gain God's glorious inheritance with all His sanctified ones
Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help'
Grace reigns over everything in order that we might abundantly obtain God's eternal life, the life of God in our Lord Jesus Christ
Since we have entered into Christ and are under grace, we are no longer under the child-conductor, so we should not live under the law
In the New Testament age any teaching that tells people to live under the law is a confusion of the truth and is heresy
Although believers are not under the law, this does not mean that they are not under any restrictions and can be completely lawless
The law of life in us regulates us in every matter, giving us an inward knowledge of what God wants to do and what He does not want to do
While we do not have any responsibility to follow the outward law of letters, we must be responsive to the inward law of life
In Christ, we have a greater, higher law, which is the life of God, the Holy Spirit of God, God Himself, and the glory of God as our law
Anything that causes us to touch the presence of God and to fellowship with God is permissible according to the law of life
There are two special phrases in the Bible that speak of a basic truth concerning God's salvation: in Adam and in Christ
When a watermelon is cut into many slices, the slices are still a part of the watermelon, and the slices equal only one watermelon
We must have God's vision and God's point of view to thoroughly know and to accurately experience His way of salvation
After Korea was defeated by Japan, the children who were born in Korea were also defeated because their country was no longer their own
When Abraham offered a tithe to Melchizedek, his descendant, Levi, also offered a tithe to Melchizedek because he was included in Abraham
If we see this, we will understand the Lord's word in John 3:18: 'He who does not believe has been condemned already'
The first aspect involves the deadening of our human spirit in which fellowship with God was broken and the human spirit lost this function
The fourth aspect is the second death in which the spirit soul and body of those who do not believe are cast into the lake of fire to suffer
Once we believe in Christ, His Spirit enters us, joins us to Christ, and causes us to be one with Christ in spirit
Just as Adams disobedience resulted in the many being constituted sinners Christs obedience resulted in the many being constituted righteous
Just as we are not sinners because we have sinned, we are not righteous because we have done some righteous works
Just as we were condemned before God because of Adam's one offense, we are justified before God because of Christ's one righteous act
We do not need to sin in order to be condemned by God; instead, because of Adam's one offense, we are condemned because we are in him
Just as we were condemned because of Adam's sin and inherited death, we were justified because of Christ's righteousness and inherited life
The death that we received because of Adams sin is out of Satan but the life that we received because of Christs righteousness is out of God
The divine life causes every part of our being to be saturated with the life of God and to enter into God's life of glory
In summary we obtain three items in Adam sin condemnation and death and we obtain three items in Christ righteousness justification and life
Christ's death dealt with our sin and condemnation in Adam, and Christ's resurrection dealt with the death that we received in Adam
Christ's death freed us from sin and condemnation in Adam and gave us righteousness and justification in Christ
If we remain in Adam, we will surely taste sin and death, but if we abide in Christ, we will surely enjoy righteousness and life
In Christ we not only have righteousness, justification, and life, but we also obtain every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies
God chose us in eternity, predestinated us, and came in time to redeem us, that is, to deal with our sin in order that we could be forgiven
Of these items wisdom can be considered as a summary, whereas the other three-righteousness, sanctification, and redemption-are the details
Although we have not fully experienced this glorious fact there will be a day in the future when this glorious fact will be manifested in us
Circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ'
The circumcision of the Israelites in the Old Testament was a symbol of the real circumcision in the New Testament
In God's salvation we were raised together with Christ, and we have left everything related to death behind us
We have been seated together with Him in the heavenlies everything of the earth and everything in the air that belong to Satan are behind us
Nothing can separate us from the love of God because this love is in Christ, and it has been given to us by God in Christ
God has not only forgiven us and no longer condemns us but He has also freed us in Christ from the control of sin and from selfcondemnation
After being saved, we have hope, especially the hope of the redemption of our bodies and of entering into God's glory
God's salvation not only enlivens our spirit today; it will also enliven our body in the future, bringing our entire being into resurrection
In the fullness of the times God will head up all things in the heavens and on the earth in Christ, including all the believers
Every believer has two natures, and if we desire to grow in the divine life, we must have a clear knowledge of these two natures
While a believer is in Adam of the old creation and also in Christ of the new creation, an unbeliever is only in Adam
Although man was created by God God did not create the old man rather the man of Gods creation became old through the corruption of the fall
In the beginning Satan, the devil, tempted man with his speaking and with the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
When man received Satan's speaking and ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan's life was injected into him
Since the life and nature of the devil were injected into Adam, the old man who comes out of Adam is also corrupted with his evil life
Corinthians 15:45-48 says that Adam was a living soul, soulish, and earthy and that those who are out of Adam are the same as Adam
The spirit with its capacity for fellowship with God directed the body through the soul in relation to man's living and actions
Satan's life with its element of sin was injected into man's body after man ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Look at the people who are dancing in a dance hall gambling in a gambling den smoking opium in an opium parlor or drinking wildly in a bar
If a person who is in the midst of a terrible fit of temper would look in a mirror, he would see that his appearance is devilish
People living by the old man spontaneously manifest a devilish appearance because their old man is constituted with the devilish life
Whereas the serpent is the embodiment of the devil , the bronze serpent had only the outward form of the devil, not his sinful content
In contrast, the flesh of man is the issue of a mixture of the human life and nature and the devil's life and nature
Deceitful above all things means that the heart is the most deceitful thing: Nothing is more deceitful than our heart
Since the devil is personified in the old man as sin and since the old man is conceived in sin, he is corrupt beyond compare
Even if we do not commit a particular sin, we still are inwardly full of sin because we have the flesh which is inwardly full of sin
In such a condition, it is not possible to be subject to the law of God even if we wanted to be subject to His law
We should apply the crucifixion of the old man in our living in order to terminate his life and power in our practical living
For this reason, we should no longer live according to 'I,' the old man, because the old man has been crucified with Christ
The inward constitution of the flesh is the old man, and the living out of our old man is manifested as the flesh
God has no desire that our old man would improve, and since our flesh is incurable, there is no way that the old man can be improved
The new man does not originate from the improvement of the old man; the new man was created by God and according to God
The old man and the new man belong to two different creations, having different origins, one that is old and one that is new
Just as the old man is out of Satan and has Satan's life and nature, the new man is out of God and has God's life and nature
Just as the old man in Adam possesses the things of Adam, the new man in Christ possesses the things of Christ
Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, is spiritual and heavenly, so the new man in Christ is spiritual and heavenly
Just as the old man in Adam is of the soul and the earth, the new man in Christ is of the Spirit and the heavens
Since the new man is born of the Holy Spirit and is out of the Holy Spirit, the nature of the new man is spiritual
When we live by the new man, we spontaneously know God's preferences, inclinations, and tendencies, and our living has the flavor of God
When we live by our old man, our living is the result of the operation of the aggregate evil spirit, over which Satan is the ruler
Similarly, when we live by our new man, our living works out God's good pleasure according to the operation of the Holy Spirit
Consequently, the new man is not capable of sin and can enable those who live by the life which is out of God to not sin
Righteousness and holiness belong to God's reality; consequently, the Bible speaks of 'righteousness and holiness of the reality'
In the new man, however, there is righteousness and holiness and the law of God's holiness, righteousness, and goodness
The old man is born in sin, belongs to sin, and cannot help but sin, but the new man is born of God, does not sin, and cannot sin
The old man is deceitful above all things and evil to the uttermost, but the new man has the righteousness and holiness of the reality
The believers in Christ have put off the old man because our death with Christ has freed us from the old man, who was crucified with Christ
In Christ we were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, which is the old man
God regards Christ's death on the cross as a circumcision that put off the old man and freed us from our flesh
May we see that Christ has freed us from the old man through His death on the cross and that we no longer have to live by the old man
Not only has Christ freed us from the old man through death; He also enables us to put on the new man through resurrection
These are accomplished facts related to His death and resurrection, and because we are in Him, we can partake of these facts
May God open our eyes to show us this glorious fact that we have received so that we may live by the new man, not by the old man
The opposition in us between the flesh and the Spirit is equal to a battle between the old man and the new man
By the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body'; 'Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth'
Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul'
Loving God with all our heart, all our soul, and all our might means to love God with our spirit, soul, and body
It reveals the things that God approves and disapproves of; it supports what God justifies, and it exposes what He condemns
We do not have to rely upon outward circumstances in order to know God's will because of the function of the intuition
Consequently, psychology divides man into only two parts, a metaphysical part, which is the soul, and a physical part, which is the body
The spirit is man's innermost part, the body is man's outermost part, and the soul is situated between the body and the spirit
In the garden the created life of man was good, the uncreated life of God was divine, and the fallen life of Satan was corrupted
The Bible speaks of Satan as God's enemy, and it reveals that there is a struggle between Satan and God over man
Just as the disobedience of Adam made all who are in him sinners, the obedience of Christ made all who are in Him righteous
In each of the three great events in the history of a believer-creation, the fall, and salvation-a different life was received
The indwelling life of the devil has been within man from the time that Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
He who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has sinned from the beginning'; 'Children of the devil'
We like what the devil likes and want to do the desires of the devil because we have the devil's life and nature
When we believed into and received the Lord, we obtained God's uncreated life because the Holy Spirit brings God's life into us
The Bible clearly shows that at the time of man's creation, he had only one kind of life, the created human life
On the one hand, man desires to be good and upright, but on the other hand, he does things that are corrupt and evil
People have at least two different kinds of life within them: the good, created human life and the corrupted, fallen satanic life
Throughout the centuries some have realized that there is an element of good within man and they have emphasized this aspect of mans nature
At the same time others have realized that there is an element of evil within man, and they speak of this aspect of man's nature
There is no need to debate this question, because there is both a good nature and an evil nature within fallen man
Every man has two natures because he has received two kinds of life-the created human life and the fallen satanic life
He injected himself into man, causing man to be corrupted through the mixture of his evil life with man's human life
While the gentleness of a man can express his good nature, his gentleness can easily be overcome by his temper, which expresses the devil
When a man acts uprightly, his good human nature is expressed, but when he sins, his corrupted devilish nature is revealed
It is also possible for them to live a proper human life because they have the good and upright created human life
As a believer, however, we should praise and thank God that we have the divine life in addition to the human life and the satanic life
Just as Satan injected his life into us through his corruption, God imparted His life into us through His salvation
If we live according to the divine life within us, we will express God's holy and righteous life and cause His will to be accomplished in us
Although it may seem as if we are living merely according to our human life with no influence from Satans life or Gods life this is not true
When he acts by the satanic life, he has the appearance of a devil, and when he moves by the divine life, he manifests the appearance of God
Even though we obtained these three kinds of life at different times and through different means, these three kinds of life are in us
We obtained the satanic life at the time of the fall through Adam's contact with Satan and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Through these three great eventscreation the fall and salvationwe have three different kinds of lifethe life of man of Satan and of God
Even though the life that we live determines the kind of living that we express, the way of the divine life is available to us as believers
When we act against the holy, righteous, and good demands of the law, it condemns us and causes us to know sin
Every thought related to doing good and to improving ourselves comes from the law of good which operates in our mind
According to the truth, the part of our being in which nothing good dwells is our flesh, not our mind, which is part of the soul
Some say that our good created life was corrupted by the fall to the point that there is no longer any element of good in it
Although the sweet taste has been corrupted, the element of sugar still exists and still provides a trace of sweetness
The considerations of the Chinese philosophers related to the element of good in our human nature fit the true condition of our human nature
The fallen, evil life of Satan entered into man's body, becoming 'the evil' that operates as the law of sin in his members
Although the evil life of Satan entered the body, it spontaneously invaded the soul and affected the human spirit
The body is the base of the operation of Satan's evil life, but this life also damaged the other parts of man's being
Humanity is referred to as flesh because all of humanity is controlled by the flesh and is completely of the flesh
In our flesh, our transmuted body, nothing good dwells; instead, there is only the evil element of Satan's life
The evil satanic life was mixed with the human life in our body, making it the flesh and corrupting it with a law that makes us sin
The second law is related to the evil, fallen satanic life that operates in the members of our body and causes us to sin
The desires of our mind and the actions of our members are in opposition to each other because they are related to opposing laws
These laws are in opposition to each other because they are related to two different laws which come out of two different kinds of life
The reasonings that either accuse and excuse are reflections of our conscience , but they operate through our mind
The lust that is related to our fallen nature is in our members; it operates in our body, working out the evil that comes from lust
Even though a mans reasoning clearly warns him of the dangers of gambling his lusts override his good reasonings and he continues to gamble
It is almost impossible for an addict to obey the reasonings in his mind and overcome the power of his addiction
Unbelievers only know the law of good and the law of sin because they have only the good created human life and the evil fallen satanic life
The law of the Spirit of life is in our spirit, not in our soul like the law of good or in our body like the law of sin
In its divine and eternal aspects, the life of God is the only life in the universe that can truly be counted as life
The life that is contained in the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit comes out of the life of God, and its nature is life
It is not like the life that is good according to our created human nature or the life that is evil according to our fallen satanic nature
The difference between the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden adequately manifests this point
The good that is spoken of in Ephesians 2:10 and 2 Timothy 2:21 is the good that comes from living out the life of God
In contrast, the good that is spoken of in Matthew 12:35, Romans 7:18-21, and 9:11 is the good that comes out of man's human life
The good that comes out of our human life is according to our human nature, which does not have the true nature of life, that is, God's life
Only the good that comes out of God's life is the good of God because only this good has the nature and element of God's life
When we speak of good throughout the remainder of this section, however, we are speaking of the good that is associated with created man
When we speak of evil, we are speaking of the evil one, Satan; when we speak of life, we are speaking of the God of life
Since the nature of each of these lives is different, each life has a law and the function of each law is different
Each of these different kind of lives, natures, and laws correspond to one of the three parts of our being-our spirit, soul, and body
The law of good is present in our soul, the law of sin is present in our body, and the law of the Spirit of life is present in our spirit
If we live according to our body, that is, according to our flesh and its lusts, we will be a person who does evil
Similarly, our goal should not be focused on avoiding evil or even on doing good; our goal should be focused on living the life of God
We can be a God-man, living according to the Spirit of life only if we live according to the Spirit in our spirit
Chinese philosophers promote the development of one's 'bright virtue' by using 'knowledge of the good' as a means to improve one's condition
Even though these efforts have some usefulness in a human sense, they are not compatible with God's way of salvation
Human work can only be focused on improving our natural goodness; it cannot bring God's life into us for our salvation
At the most human improvement can brighten our bright virtue improve our knowledge of the good and expand the brightness of our inner heart
Even if we could attain to the highest peak of human goodness, it would not compare to the standard of God's holy nature
The law of good in our mind is a natural principle, and according to its natural power, it causes us to desire to do good
Since this natural law in our mind desires to do good, our will spontaneously determines to do the good that our mind desires
Neither this desire nor the determination to do good is forced upon us; they are spontaneous reactions related to our good human nature
The law of sin in our members is also a natural principle, and according to its natural power, it causes us to sin
Our sinful responses to our lustful flesh are not forced upon us; they are spontaneous reactions related to our sinful, satanic nature
Consequently, the law of the Spirit of life is the strongest law, and it can conquer the law of sin, which is stronger than the law of good
Our behavior, such as the determinations of our mind or the strivings of our will, cannot control the power of the law of sin in our members
If we strive to conquer sin according to the reasonings in our mind, we will fail and fall into a wretched condition
If we live in our spirit and follow the law of the Spirit of life we will be freed from the law of sin and live according to the life of God
The law of God given to Moses is outside of us; the other three laws are within our soul, body, and spirit respectively
The law in our soul comes from our good created human life; this law is good and causes us to desire to do good
The law in our spirit comes from the divine, uncreated life of God; this law is divine and causes us to live out God's divine life
The law of good in our mind immediately and positively responds to this demand by determining to fulfill the law of God
The law of the Spirit of life in our spirit is stronger than the law of good in our soul and the law of sin in our body
In every battle between these two laws, the law of good in our soul inevitably loses to the law of sin in our body
Just as our body surrounds our soul, the law of sin in our body surrounds and defeats the law of good in our soul
It is impossible for the law of good in our soul to overcome the law of sin in our body to fulfill the demands of the law of God
In her acceptance, she also realizes that the angel corresponds with the proper man so that she now has the power to follow the proper man
The law of good in our mind desires to fulfill the demands of the law of God, but it has no power to overcome the law of sin
God's way of salvation does not involve dealing with the sin in our body or by strengthening our will to do good in our soul
The mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be
In each of our three parts-spirit, soul, and body-there is a different life and a different law with a different operation
When our living comes out of a certain part, the law of the life of that part causes us to live out the nature of its life
We have mentioned previously that our body was transmuted into the flesh because of its mixture with the evil life of Satan
According to the Bible, the mind set on the flesh is enmity with God because it is not subject to the law of God and cannot be subject to it
The flesh prevents the law from enabling us to reach the standard of God's holiness, righteousness, and goodness
Although the body causes us to sin because the law of sin is in our body, we also have two other parts-the soul and the spirit
Although our soul still has the good element of its created human nature, it was stained and corrupted by Satan and his sinful life
Although the law of good in our soul comes out of our good, created life, this life is weak, impotent, and incapable of freeing us from sin
The law in our fallen soul, even though it is related to our good, created life, cannot free us from the power of sin
Of our spirit, soul, and body, freedom from sin can come only from our human spirit because the law of the Spirit of life is in the spirit
God saves us from sin through the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of life is in our spirit and one with our spirit
In the same way, when we set our mind on the spirit and live according to the spirit, we are righteous and also live
We are kept from death and weakness by being freed from sin, and we gain life and strength by living out righteousness
If we set our mind on the flesh and live according to the flesh, the law of sin in our body will cause us to sin
If we set our mind on the spirit and live according to the spirit, the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit will free us from sin
The secret of being free from sin is to set our mind on the spirit and follow the law of the Spirit of life in our spirit
We should not focus on trying to do good, just as we should not focus on rejecting things that are sinful and evil
Doing good should not be the goal of our living, just as avoiding evil should also not be the focus of our living
We must learn not to be distracted by a life that is according to the flesh or according to the soul in order to bear this responsibility
Both our tendency to do evil and our desire to do good frustrate us from walking according to the Spirit of life in our spirit
The goal of God's work is to work Himself into man and to work man into Himself so that we would be joined as one with Him
Christ is the manifestation of God; consequently, Christ's coming to be in union with us is equal to God's coming to be in union with us
Emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man'
He was incarnated in the likeness of the flesh of sin in order to be like us, but He did not have the reality of our sin
In His incarnation He had the likeness of the flesh of sin outwardly, but He did not have the reality of sin inwardly
He lives in us and is in union with us to the extent that He is our life, living for us and causing us to live
Christ desires to live in us and be in union with us to such an extent that our hearts would be full of His living and His love
God will be the light, and Christ will be the lamp, shining out the light of God through the believers in our union with Him
Christ, who did not know sin, was made sin by God on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him
When tea leaves are added to hot water, the water turns into tea, and when a person drinks the water, he also drinks the tea
In His judgment of the situation, God commanded that a bronze serpent in the likeness of a serpent be hung upon a pole
In doing this, He entered into union with us sinners in order to bear our judgment so that we might enter into union with Him
Christ entered into union with us when He was made sin on our behalf and we entered into union with Him by becoming the righteousness of God
Although His union with us began at His incarnation, our union with Him did not begin until after He bore our sins on the cross
He is living in resurrection, and since we are in Him, we have been resurrected together with Him to live together with Him
His accomplishments are our gain: His death is our death; His resurrection is our resurrection; and His ascension is our ascension
Baptized into His death'; 'Buried together with Him in baptism, in which also you were raised together with Him'
In our salvation our deadened spirit was made alive so that we could be joined as one spirit with Christ in our spirit
Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption'
When we believed in Christ, God put us into Christ, causing us to partake of Christ and making Christ our wisdom
When we were saved, God brought us into a union with Christ, making Christ our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption
After we are saved, we should live in Christ as our life, continuously experiencing our union with Him until He is manifested in His return
When He returns, our body will be so saturated with His element that our body will be transfigured to be conformed to the body of His glory
From the inside to the outside, our whole being will be saturated with His element and completely in union with Him in His life and glory
The service of the new covenant is completely different from the service of the old covenant because of its special characteristics
The law of the old covenant was written with letters on stone tablets outside of man, so it was outward and dead
Since the law of the new covenant is within man, the knowledge of God related to the new covenant is also within man
Even though the child has no concept of bitter or sweet, his inward life reacts negatively to what is bitter and positively to what is sweet
In the new covenant we do not need others to teach us to know God because we all have the law of life that causes us to know God
Man teaches according to outward knowledge, but the knowledge that comes from the law of life replaces and even surpasses man's teaching
The believers who serve God are the Body of Christ, the church, and are members one of another, manifesting their function in the Body
In the new covenant God wants the believers in Christ to express Christ throughout the universe as the Body of Christ, which is the church
If we want to know the true service of the new covenant, we must understand these five special characteristics
Consequently, the special characteristics of the new covenant are also the characteristics of the service of the new covenant
In the service of ordinances, there also is no need for fellowship with God; we need only to follow an established ordinance
Today we do not serve God according to weak and dead ordinances but according to the power of an indestructible life
Not of the letter but of the Spirit'; 'In spirit, not in letter'; 'In newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter'
The service of the new covenant is not according to ordinances but according to life, and it is not of the letter but of the Spirit
Those who served God under the old covenant only had to follow written regulations in order for their service to be proper
These prayers are fully in the realm of the letter, and they cannot be considered as service in the new covenant
These prayers which are recited like lessons are completely according to the letter and cannot be considered as service in the new covenant
Similarly, when some preach, they use the same message or copy the words of others, often repeating their words in an old way
Service in the new covenant must be based on the inspiration and leading of the Lord that comes out of fellowship with Him
The service of the new covenant is not according to ordinances or letters but according to the power of life and the Spirit
Inward service requires an inward burden and must come out of the inward operation and inspiration of the Spirit
Only that which comes from our spirit and out of our inward life can be considered as service in the new covenant
Service in the new covenant does not involve the service of a special few but a service of all the believers, all the brothers
In Romans 12 Paul exhorts the brothers who have received God's salvation to present their bodies to God to serve Him
His exhortation is not directed toward a few gifted brothers; rather, he exhorts all the brothers who have received God's salvation
In principle, service that is limited to a few is not service according to the new covenant but service according to the old covenant
The service of the new covenant is the service of the Body, and even individually we still are members of the Body
The service of the new covenant is according to life, so if we want to serve according to the new covenant, we must be in life
Whenever we live by ourselves, whenever we live under the law, we cannot be delivered from the service of the law of ordinances
When we live by the Lord and His life, we are in the service of the new covenant, which is according to the power of life
If we want to live in the Lord and by the Lord, we must live by the Spirit, which is to be according to the spirit and to walk by the Spirit
We can be delivered from letters and ordinances only by living according to the spirit and walking by the Spirit
It is to live according to the inward sense of life and to live according to the inward operation of the Spirit
When we live by the Spirit's inward operation, our willing and our working are according to the operation of God in us
Consequently, all the brothers and sisters must present themselves as a living sacrifice to work out their ministry as priests to God
We must live in the Body in order to have the service of the new covenant because this service is the service of the Body
When the Lord Jesus was judged by God on the cross, He bore all the sins of those who would believe in Him, and He took them away
God has not only forgiven us of our sins but also wiped away our sins because the Lord bore our sins upon the cross
Forgiving erases the record of sin; that is, it eliminates our responsibility to answer for our sins according to God's righteousness
The sins that we committed prior to our salvation have been completely wiped away, even though they were like a thick cloud hanging over us
When the Lord Jesus bore our sins, God wiped them away, causing them to disappear as if they had never been committed
Not only does God forgive and wipe away the sins that we committed prior to our salvation; He does not even remember them
Our sins have not only been eliminated before God's law and removed from us; they also have been erased from God's memory
Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed
We should not participate in sinful acts but live a life without sin so that we can become a new and holy lump with all the saints
Some say that it is not possible for believers to sin after their salvation, and others say that it is possible
According to his thought, it is possible for us to sin after our salvation even though this should be neither intentional nor acceptable
The apostle says that believers should be careful when they seek to restore a stumbled, sinning brother lest they also be tempted
Those who say that a believer cannot sin after believing have not received the apostle's warning that it is possible to fall into sin
Demas, a co-worker with the apostle, loved the world that had been condemned by the Lord and abandoned the apostle
If this is a possibility for a co-worker, how much more is it possible for a believer who has just been saved?
Similarly, sinning is not in our new nature or in our habit, even though we can fall into sin if we are not careful
Deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord'
Sins do not result in the loss of our eternal salvation, even if we experience God's discipline and punishment
Sins committed after our salvation do not result in eternal perdition but they can result in suffering in this age
The Bible does not speak of a believer perishing if he sins; it speaks only of a believer being punished if he sins
If we stumble, we do not need to repent for the sins that we committed prior to our salvation and believe again
We do not need to return to our initial experience of Christ's salvation and repent of sins that have already been forgiven
Even if we wanted to repent and believe again, this would be an impossibility because God has already forgiven us of those sins
They are like a field that has received so much rain that it grows more thorns and weeds than useful vegetables
Hebrews 10:25-31 was written to Hebrew believers who were returning to their Jewish background and environment
In effect, he is returning to a covenant that God has ended through the coming of Christ and His redemptive death
If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous; and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins'
If we commit sins after our salvation, we have the Lord Jesus as our Advocate and as the propitiation for our sins
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
He is propitiating for us in every situation so that we can be in fellowship with God, and His blood constantly cleanses us
If we sin, we should confess our sins to God, depending on the Lord Jesus as our Advocate and receiving the constant cleansing of His blood
There are passages in the Bible, such as Matthew 5:22; Hebrews 6:8; and 10:27, which speak of punishment for believers who sin
Even though the Bible speaks of believers sinning after their salvation, it also speaks of believers avoiding sin
Under the law means that we are using our own strength to refuse sin, but our strength is insufficient to free us from the bondage of sin
Under God's grace, which is the life of God in Christ and is just God Himself, we can be freed from the bondage of sin in order to avoid sin
Under the grace of God and with God in Christ as our life and power, sin cannot lord it over us; consequently, we can avoid sin
If we see and receive the fact of our crucifixion with Christ by faith, we can reckon ourselves dead to sin but living to God
If we look only at ourselves, we are still alive, but if we reckon ourselves in Christ, we will be dead to sin
If we are willing to reject sin and cooperate to present ourselves to God, we can be freed from the bondage of sin and avoid sin
The law of the Spirit of life causes us to enjoy the resurrection power of God's life and frees us from the law that makes us sin unto death
