   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX THE WAY TO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD S PRESENT MOVE Scripture Reading: Acts 5:42; 1 Cor 14:26; 12:8; 1 Tim 3:2; 5:17</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, how we worship You and thank You that You have raised up Your recovery in these final days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank You, Lord, that You have opened up Your Word to us and have unveiled to us so many truths concerning God s New Testament economy and the Triune God being processed and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we thank You for this time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank You for Your present move among us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, we all are here.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We want to tell You that we are ready.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, have Your way and have a free course among us and in each one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Spread Your move throughout the United States and throughout the entire world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, gain the glory and carry us on.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We like to cooperate with You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thank You for Your mercy and thank You for Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this chapter, we want to see the way to practice the Lord s present move.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not want to practice anything in the past or even anything practiced among us in the United States in the past twenty-three years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We want to practice the Lord s up-to-date move.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since Genesis 3 right after the fall of man the Lord began to move.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He moved through Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He moved through Enosh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He moved through Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He moved through Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He moved through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He moved through Moses, Samuel, David, and so many others in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He moved through John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He moved through the very embodiment of the Triune God, Jesus Christ, and He moved through the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He moved throughout church history through many of His loving seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord is also moving right now.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our God is neither dead nor dormant, but He is living and moving here and now.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord is still moving on this earth among us and with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have the assurance to say that the Lord is moving among us up to the present day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are talking about the way to practice the Lord s present move.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not refer back to Elden Hall in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That was in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are not talking about that, but about the Lord s present move.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all should be excited about His present move.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise Him for the up-to-date way to practice His present move.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TO BE FILLED WITH THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>INWARDLY AND OUTWARDLY</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first point of the up-to-date way to practice the Lord s present move is to be filled!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The way is to be filled, not with culture, religion, or education, but with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to be filled with such a Spirit inwardly and outwardly, essentially and economically, for life and for work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should remember that we are not filled once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What Christ has accomplished is once for all, but what we have to experience is not.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Time after time, day after day, morning after morning, evening after evening, all day long, we have to experience being filled with this wonderful, all-inclusive, processed, consummated Spirit for our entire lives.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Every day in the morning the first thing we have to pray is, Lord, fill me afresh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Fill me, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Fill me with Yourself as the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I like to have You filling me up within and without.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I want to be wrapped up and mingled with You.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every morning you should pray this prayer Fill me up, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fill me up!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I would like to hear many testimonies that even in your dreams you are crying out, Lord, fill me up!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I need You to fill me up!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Saturate, infuse, transfuse, soak and permeate me!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Exhaust all the verbs in the dictionary to tell the Lord you want Him to fill you up.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do this every day.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Tell the Lord, I was too dormant, but now I want to rise up by being filled with You.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Forget about Elden Hall.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Forget about yesterday s enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You need a fresh enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You need something up-to-date.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord was there in Elden Hall, but He is not there now.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is here presently moving in His recovery and He is in you.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Wherever you are, He is in you, and He is in you right now.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do you believe He is repeating all the things He did in the past?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He is not repeating anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is always going on and on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Lord is working.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He is moving.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Are you a person of yesterday?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>All of us should be people of today.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Every day is a today.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>With some people every day is tomorrow and with others every day is yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some of the saints may say, How good it was in 1952 when I got saved!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Even to look back to 1982 is to not be up-to-date.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not look ahead to the future and do not look back to the past.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We are people of today.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do not talk about your old experiences in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Talk about your experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Be filled today!</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Be filled, not yesterday nor tomorrow, but today!</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Every day is a today!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We do not have yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We had yesterday, but we do not have it now.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We will never have tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>All the time we have is today.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Every day is a today!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When we enter into the New Jerusalem, we will have today since every day in eternity is today.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The only day we have is today.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Be filled inwardly today!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Be filled outwardly today!</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Be filled today!</S>
