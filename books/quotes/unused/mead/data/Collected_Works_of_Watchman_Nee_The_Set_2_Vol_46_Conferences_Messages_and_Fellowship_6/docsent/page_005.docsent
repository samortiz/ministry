   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTY-TWO SPIRITUAL REALITY THREE VIEWS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Editor's Note: This article is similar to the first part of "The Holy Spirit and Reality" in Volume 36 of The Collected Works.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have included this chapter in this volume because it contains some additional utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Scripture Reading: John 4:23; 16:13; 3:5; 6:51-54; Matt 26:26-29; 16:18-19; 18:17-18; Acts 13:2-4; Rom 6:3-5; 1 Cor 10:16-17; 11:24-25; Col 2:11-12</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christianity is not a combination of externalities.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is "the truth," that is, the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So much that is merely external has become associated with Christianity that it is difficult to discern what truly is of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Let us consider this vital question: What is of God?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is reality?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Word of God tells us that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of reality, and that He will lead us into all reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Anything which can separate us from the leading of the Spirit is not reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Outside the sphere of the Spirit, which is the sphere of God, there is no reality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only that which is spiritual is real, and spiritual things can only subsist in the realm of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If something is separated from the Spirit, it is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are to be brought into any spiritual reality, it can only be through our dependence on the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whatever we can arrive at by thought and study, by the seeing of the eyes and the hearing of the ears, is outside the realm of eternal verity; it is not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this light, let us briefly examine baptism, the Lord's supper, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are three different viewpoints regarding these: the materialistic viewpoint, the intellectual viewpoint, and the spiritual viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, we might refer to these viewpoints as Romish, Reformist, and Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE MATERIALISTIC VIEWPOINT Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The materialist fixes his gaze on the water and insists that without material water there is no new birth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This begets the Romish doctrine of baptismal regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord's Supper</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The materialist notes the word, "This is My body" Matt 26:26 , and looking at the material bread, he insists that a change must take place in the bread so that it may be truly called Christ's body, because the Word is true.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The result is the Romish doctrine of transubstantiation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Church</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The materialist sees the outward form of the church and sees in the Word that there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The result is the Romish doctrine of the one true church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE INTELLECTUAL VIEWPOINT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The intellectual man is puzzled by the seeming inconsistency between the Word of God and so-called Christianity, so he brings his mind to bear on the problems that arise.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Baptism</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He says there is the true and the false, the real and the unreal, the outward ceremony and the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, God makes no such distinctions in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's Supper</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The reformist says, "This represents the Lord's body; it is a symbol of His body."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Word of God speaks of nothing concerning representation or symbolism; it speaks of literal fact.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It says, "This is My body."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Church</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reformist solves the inconsistency that he observes by using his interpretation of true and false, real and unreal.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Or he says, "There is a church within the church."</S>
