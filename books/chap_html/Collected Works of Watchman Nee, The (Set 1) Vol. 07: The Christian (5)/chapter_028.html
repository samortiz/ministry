<H1 CLASS=TITLE>NOTES FROM MY BIBLE</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 7</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1 JOHN 4</H2><P>Verse 4:"You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world." We do not have to search elsewhere, for He is already in us. We overcome because the One who is in us is greater than the evil spirits. We do not have to be afraid of the world, because what is in the world is only the evil spirits.</P><P>Verse 5:"They are of the world; therefore they speak out of the world, and the world hears them." Those who can gain the majority of the world to hear them and who themselves remain part of the world must have some problems with them; they must be of the evil spirits.</P><P>Verse 6:"We are of God; he who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. From this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deception." Those who would not follow the teaching of the apostles and, in particular, the teaching of John, are those who willingly follow the spirit of deception.</P><P>Verse 7:"Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God, and everyone who loves has been begotten of God and knows God." Love is the greatest test.</P><P>Verses 8-13:"He who does not love has not known God, because God is love. In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him. Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God has loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another. No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us. In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given to us of His Spirit."</P><P>Who is love? God.</P><P>Who has loved us? God.</P><P>What is love? God sending His Son as a propitiation.</P><P>Where is love manifested? In His sending of His Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him.</P><P>What does love inspire us to do? We should love one another.</P><P>How do we love God perfectly? Love one another.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 24</H2><P>Verse 25:"And as he was reasoning concerning righteousness and self-control and the judgment to come, Felix became afraid and answered, Go for the present, and when I have an opportunity, I will call for you." He was "afraid" and postponed the question of salvation to a later day, thus missing his chance! Now is the most convenient time. If now is not convenient, never will it be "convenient." It is either now or never.</P><P>Verse 26:"Hoping at the same time also that money would be given to him by Paul. Therefore he also sent for him more frequently and conversed with him." The other day he did not want to receive the word of the Lord, but this day he wanted money! Even if he did get Paul to come, his seeking heart for the word had died already.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ACTS 25</H2><P>Verse 4:"Festus therefore answered that Paul was being kept in custody in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to proceed there shortly." The way the Lord protected His servant was wonderful! Prior to this (23:12), the Jews plotted against him, and the nephew of Paul came and informed the people. Although this time no one knew their plan, the Lord caused Festus to refuse their suggestion. "All things work together for good" (Rom. 8:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NUMBERS 15</H2><P>Verse 2:"Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When you come into the land of your habitations, which I am giving to you." The Lord was now rejecting the disobedient people and was casting them aside. He was now revealing to Moses how the Israelites who would go into Canaan should act. These ordinances were to have nothing to do with these hundreds of thousands of people!</P>
