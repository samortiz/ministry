<h2 class=head2>By the Transmission of Christ as the Spirit</h2><p>If Christ were not the Spirit, He could not be our power within. Therefore, we must come back to the Spirit. We can never and should never forget Philippians 1:19, which speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. If Christ were not the “electricity,” how could He be the power to us? He is the electricity transmitted to us by the Spirit as the current. The current, the transmission, of the electricity is the electricity itself, just as the circulation of blood is the blood itself flowing. Without the blood, there is no circulation, but we use the term circulation to describe the movement of the blood. In the same way, the Holy Spirit is the transmission of the Lord, although in actuality the Spirit is the Lord Himself.<p>If the Lord Himself were not the Spirit as the transmission, how could He be subjective to us? How could we be in Him and He in us? In John 15:4 the Lord Jesus said, “Abide in Me and I in you.” The only way to abide in Christ and for Him to abide in us is by the Spirit. This is the reason John 14 indicates that Christ was to be transfigured as the Spirit. Christ could not abide in us and we could not abide in Him until the things mentioned John 14 were accomplished. Now Christ is the Spirit (John 14:16-18; 2 Cor. 3:17), and as the Spirit He enters into us. In this way, we are in Him and He is in us. He and we, we and He, become a mutual abode; we abide in Him and He abides in us. This is a matter entirely of the Spirit. Therefore, we repeat this vital point: We must know our spirit and realize the Holy Spirit. For Christ to be our power and our secret is not an objective matter; it is one hundred percent subjective to us. If we know Him in the spirit and as the Spirit, we will experience Him.<p>If we are impressed deeply with all of these points in the four sections of Philippians, this book will be very clear to us. We must take Christ as our life and our expression, our pattern and our example, our goal and our aim, and our secret and our power. Then we can do all things in Him who empowers us. He is our secret. Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians are four wonderful books in the Bible. If we experience the Christ in Galatians and Philippians, we will know His Body in Ephesians; then we will realize Christ as the Head in Colossians.
