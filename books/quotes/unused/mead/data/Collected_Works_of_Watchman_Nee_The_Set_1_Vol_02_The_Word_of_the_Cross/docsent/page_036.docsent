   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaiah's prayer said, "Oh that You would rend the heavens, that You would come down..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Isa 64:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus Himself said, "And no one has ascended into heaven, but He who descended out of heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven" John 3:13 , "for I have come down from heaven" 6:38, 42 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When the Lord Jesus ascended, the Bible says, "A cloud took Him away....And while they were looking intently into heaven as He went..."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 1:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Stephen, when he was about to die, saw the Son of Man standing to welcome the first martyred servant.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Lord descends from heaven, all those believers who love Him "will be caught up together with them...to meet the Lord in the air" 1 Thes 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are many more verses that can be quoted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But these few are enough to prove that heaven, the dwelling place of God, is above.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Above?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet where is above?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The earth we are now living on is spherical in shape.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we say "above," at which point on earth is it "above"?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we say that heaven is above the earth, there is a big difference between whether it is above Nanking or above Kuangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The place above North America and the place above China are in two extremes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Naturally, any point directly above the earth must be at right angles with the horizon of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, the different points above the different places on the earth would be pointing toward different directions east, west, north, or south.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If so, heaven would not be a definite place, but would be everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, as mentioned earlier, heaven is a definite place; it is not everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, "heaven above" cannot be interpreted this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Bible also says, "The heavens are higher than the earth" Isa 55:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"For as the heaven is high above the earth..."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Psa 103:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Heaven is the highest point in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is now in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is "far above all the heavens" Eph 4:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the heaven where He is must be above all heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, "higher than the earth" does not indicate a definite place, because the shape of the earth is round and the earth is in the midst of a void.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Any direction can be a place higher than the round earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Heaven is a definite place; it is not a place that exists in all directions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, heaven being higher than the earth should be explained differently.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>HEAVEN ON THE SIDES OF THE NORTH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us consider a passage in the Bible which clearly declares where heaven is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Isaiah 14:12-14 says:</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How you have fallen from heaven,</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>O Daystar, son of the dawn!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How you have been hewn down to earth,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You who made nations fall prostrate!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But you, you said in your heart:</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I will ascend to heaven;</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Above the stars of God</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I will exalt my throne.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And I will sit upon the mount of assembly</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the sides of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I will be like the Most High.</S>
