   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BELIEVE HIM FOR HIS WORKS' SAKE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In John 14:11 He said to His disciples, "Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the same as saying that He is the invisible Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"But if not, believe because of the works themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If He had not done anything impossible, this word would have had no value at all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If He had not performed any extraordinary acts, they would have asked back, "What works have You done?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not know what You are talking about."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the disciples knew of the acts He did.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All these acts prove that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>HE SHOWED WHAT GOD IS</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to check Jesus of Nazareth against a fifth qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If He is God, He has to show us what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is He kind, or is He severe?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Is He gentle, or is He fierce?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What kind of a God do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a matter of fact, Jesus did show us what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a most wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The eternal, invisible God is now seen by us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need to conjure up an untouchable and far transcendent God or imagine what He is like; He has revealed Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He has dwelt in our midst and walked among us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Jesus of Nazareth is the very God dwelling among and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He has manifested God's nature and attributes to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is no need to search for God anymore because He has revealed Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our mentality is too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our hands are too short, and our viewpoint too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we were left to ourselves to study and search for God, we could only conclude that He is the unknown One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now we know that God desires to reveal Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In fact, He has revealed Himself to us already.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GOD HAVING SPOKEN IN HIS SON</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have said that the two means whereby God communicates with us are the written and spoken language.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this reason, the Bible and Jesus of Nazareth are the two indispensable factors in our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you take away either one, God becomes the gravest problem in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hebrews 1:1 says, "God, having spoken of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These speakings constitute the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son" v. 2 . This is Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whoever is in Christ now may know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To have heard the words of Jesus of Nazareth is to have heard the words of God.</S>
