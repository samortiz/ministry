<p>In order to receive God as grace, we must draw near to God through prayer. Prayer has a special place in spiritual matters. It cannot be replaced by listening to messages or by reading the Bible or spiritual books. It cannot even be replaced by fellowshipping with other saints. The only way to contact God is to turn to our spirit and pray. This is an ironclad law. If we do not practice this, we will not receive grace. A person who desires to be healthy must eat and drink properly; there is no other way to be healthy. God lives in His believers; hence, if we want to receive mercy and grace, we must contact Him through prayer.</p>
<p>It is possible for some saints to go through a whole day without praying. Some saints do not pray for weeks, months, or even a year. What is the benefit of listening to messages if one does not pray? Some saints pray, but they do not get past their soul; they do not touch their spirit. Such prayers do not have much value.</p>
<p>I would like to ask, how much time do we spend fellowshipping with God? In order for an electric iron to be hot, the switch must be turned on to allow electricity to flow. Are we hot, or are we cold? If we are not hot, we have not let God, our spiritual electricity, flow through us. Contacting God through prayer can be compared to turning on the switch that lets Him flow freely through us. Only in this way can we be burning in spirit.</p>
<p>We must see the importance of prayer: it enables us to contact God and receive Him. Reading the Bible, listening to messages, and fellowshipping are but means that turn us to pray in order to contact God with our spirit. Hence, we should pray whenever we read the Bible, listen to messages, read spiritual books, or fellowship with other saints.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that this is not our practice. Many saints are touched when they hear a message, but they do not pray; hence, the inspiration disappears. Some saints are touched when they read the Bible, but the inspiration is forgotten because they do not pray. Sometimes a saint is inspired through fellowship with others, but the inspiration leaves because he does not pray afterward. These examples show the issue of our lack of prayer.</p>
<p>Christians do not pray enough, and many of those who pray do not know how to turn to their spirit. Their prayers are routine and do not touch the Spirit. After a message meeting, for example, everyone rushes home, because we are not used to exercising our spirit in prayer. Hence, we do not touch God.</p>
<p>The prayer meeting has the lowest attendance. Many saints do not know the importance of prayer. They consider prayer to be tedious and tasteless. Furthermore, even though a larger number of saints attend the bread-breaking meeting, only a few open their mouths to pray and praise; the rest are silent. Some saints attend every bread-breaking meeting, but they never pray. This is our situation. We cannot deny how poor and weak we are in the matter of prayer.</p>
<p>We are short of God&rsquo;s grace, the work does not spread, the church is not being built up, there is not much growth in life, and there is no coordination, because our prayers are inadequate. This situation can be likened to building a house with cement but not having any water. A person may have all the necessary materials, such as cement, sand, and gravel, but without water the materials cannot be mixed together. This is our situation. The saints love the Lord but lack the mingling in spirit and the flow of the water of life; hence, they are not built up. The reason for this situation is that we are short of prayer. From this time onward, we must focus more on prayer.</p>
<p>After a message is given, we will gather in small groups so that we can spend some time in prayer. In the small groups we will not focus on testing our knowledge. Our desire is to enliven the saints by leading them to use their spirit to pray and thus fulfill their priestly function. Most of the saints know doctrine, but we need to enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, to draw near to God in our spirit. This is not a matter of understanding or speaking doctrines. It is entirely a matter of exercising our spirit to pray.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 44</div><br></body></html>
