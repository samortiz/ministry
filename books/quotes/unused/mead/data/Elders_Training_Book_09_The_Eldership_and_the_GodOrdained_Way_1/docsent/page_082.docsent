   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We need to take care of the new believers for at least six months.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is best if we can care for them for a year until they are established.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After one year of care, they can be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should carry out the new way according to all the fellowship we have published in the recent past.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we follow the details of this fellowship in our practice, we will see that it really works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The new ones will be brought on quickly or slowly according to their particular case.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we care for them for six months to a year, they will be ready to present themselves as a living sacrifice to God as Romans 12:1 instructs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, they should be able to do what we can do in the priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our group meetings will increase and eventually will have to divide.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We hope that at least about one-third of the saints in the church would practice this kind of gospel visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Suppose there is a church with one hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The leading brothers should pray, "Lord, raise up at least thirty-five of the saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We even ask You for fifty."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have the assurance that if we practice this way according to what we have published, every saint who is exercised in this way will bring in two new ones a year.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With this kind of endeavor, it is possible for the church to double in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if the church increases yearly by thirty percent, that would be the fastest growing church on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would like to say again that the first step is to have a conference to stir up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then the saints who want to take this way can be grouped into teams of three to go out to visit people regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They can keep going to visit the ones they gain for six months to a year.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After one year a group meeting should increase in size so that it can be divided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The group meeting occupies eighty percent of the practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The main part of the church life depends on the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the group meetings, the saints will be spontaneously perfected to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Whether or not the saints will prophesy depends upon our practice of the group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to take the first step to get people saved and the second step to have home meetings with them in order to raise them up in the way that parents raise up their children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we need to bring them into the group meetings so that they can be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nearly everyone who attends the group meetings constantly and regularly will prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They will be able to prophesy, and they will have a desire to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to practice the group meetings in an organic way, we have much to learn.</S>
