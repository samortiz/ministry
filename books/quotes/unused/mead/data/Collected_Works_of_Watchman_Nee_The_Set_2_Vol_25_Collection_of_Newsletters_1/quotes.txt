[2]  In order to facilitate fellowship between the churches and communication among the saints in various localities, Watchman Nee published Collection of Newsletters at the end of 1933.
[3]  Its origin is explained in his open letter to all the brothers and sisters in the first issue of the magazine.
[4]  This letter by Watchman Nee to the brothers and sisters meeting in various places explains the reason for publishing Collection of Newsletters.
[5]  In this end time He has given us light and enabled us to know that it is His pleasure to manifest through us in this world the characteristics which befit His church in order that He might obtain something for Himself.
[6]  The second day after you left Chefoo, the young Brother Lee came to my home in the evening and wanted to bring you to Brother Lee of the Shin-feng Company to console the latter.
[7]  1 The meetings here have been deeply blessed by the Lord.
[8]  Although Brother Nee has passed some teachings on to us, they were general and not detailed, so I beg you, brother, for the Lord's sake to take time out of your busy schedule to give me a letter with detailed teachings, so that we do not fall and shame the Lord's name.
[9]  Peace in the Lord to my brothers in Him, Messrs.
[10]  I have not corresponded with you for a long time, and my spirit misses you.
[11]  I miss you, but even more I remember you when I pray.
[12]  I have already believed in Christ and am truly a child of God.
[13]  I do not know whether all these are the discipline of God or the attacks of Satan.
[14]  The Lord said, "Blessed are you when they reproach...you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you...rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens" Matt 5:11-12 .
[15]  However, it is a pity that the outsiders do not understand that our motivation in the Lord is to express the presence of the Lord Himself.
[16]  Please Note: All the brothers and sisters who fellowship with us should write and tell us whether they want to continue this publication.
[17]  Because many friends from distant places do not have friends or family in Shanghai to stay with and our place is not the most spacious, there are many things that are lacking.
[18]  If there is any lack in our hospitality, I ask you ahead of time to forgive us!
[19]  With regard to the price of meals, we do not set a price, nor do we determine not to accept money.
[20]  We only ask for voluntary help according to the ability of the brothers and sisters attending the conference and the Lord's leading.
[21]  We hope that whoever is not clear that he is saved or is saved but does not seek the Lord with hunger and thirst will not come.
[22]  So you who are as dear to me as a teacher but who treat me like a fellow student do not know how the meetings here Kuai Huo Lin Street, Ling Tzu began, what their condition is, and how the work is, etc. Since receiving your letter, I have had a deep feeling of doing a kind of wrong to the extent that the beloved in the Lord cannot pray for us, cannot thank, cannot correct, cannot give all the glory to God.
[23]  When we first began meeting, to avoid being identified with all the other churches, either great or small we were only half a mile away from a denomination , we called ourselves the Bible Study Place.
[24]  But this was slightly in error because our meeting should not be called by some local names or be named after a method.
[25]  In the table meetings, some of the sisters who break bread with us carry or bring their children to the meetings.
[26]  They are often noisy and bother the people in the meeting.
[27]  May the Lord bless us so that in the upcoming meeting, we will have the opportunity to speak with you face to face.
[28]  We especially greet Brothers Chang Kuang Jung, Tu Chung Ch'un, Ho Yue Chiao, Huang Tsai Ching, John Wu, Chou Hsin Yi, and we greet all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.
[29]  I am sure that you are very busy because it has been so long since you have written.
[30]  Even more we hope that the Lord will raise up brothers who can bear the responsibility for the meetings so that we can have the table meeting.
[31]  I hope that you also remember us often and ask the Lord to glorify Himself and ask God Himself to do a deep work so that we might completely turn to Him as His most beloved children.
[32]  The list of the meetings in the Lord's name in the region of Fu Ning County, northern Kiangsu province:
[33]  In the Bible, there is no clear word that places baptism and breaking bread together.
[34]  1 The example in the Bible shows us that on the night the Lord was betrayed, all those who took the table together had been baptized.
[35]  3 February March 1934 THE BEGINNING AND HISTORY OF THE MEETINGS
[36]  Many brothers and sisters who loved the Lord and who were seeking the truth came from P'u Men, Chiang Nan, Tai Sun, Fu Ting, or from other places both near and far in our area.
[37]  Wu Tai Mountain is about twenty miles to the south of Ch'iao Tun Men.
[38]  It is mountainous and has more than twenty small villages.
[39]  In 1928 a few brothers and two sisters heard the Word in Ch'iao Tun Men and were saved.
[40]  The meeting in Ao Nei is ten miles from Lee Chia Ching.
[41]  In his heart there was a battle because he deeply felt that the Holy Spirit could not work with them there because of the many errors in the particular denomination.
[42]  The brothers who bore the responsibility in the denomination, Lin Li Ming and P'an Tu Ch'i Brother P'an passed away the year before last , were humble seekers of the truth.
[43]  The Holy Spirit worked with them, and it seems that many of the sisters and brothers who heard the Word were saved.
[44]  Now there are more than twenty brothers and sisters who meet together to break bread in remembrance of the Lord in the afternoon.
[45]  After we left you and returned to the East, God kept us safe all the way home.
[46]  On Tuesday we arrived at Yi Lin and on the next day we parted from Chiu Jih Chien and the other brothers and returned to our homes.
[47]  Please greet Brother Nee, Brother Chang, Brother Shih, Brother Wu, Brother Huang, Brother Chou, Brother Huang Tze Hou, Brother Yuan, Brother Hu, and all the brothers and sisters in the Lord.
[48]  After we left you, we boarded the steamer at 2:00 p.m. in the afternoon.
[49]  I was afraid you would worry about us, so I am writing to let you know that we are safe.
[50]  This is a record of a question and answer meeting.
[51]  Brother Chang Kuang Jung asked: How should letters of recommendation for the traveling brothers be written?
[52]  Brother Watchman Nee answered: Please remember that letters of recommendation were found at the time of the apostles.
[53]  In my opinion, there is a definite need for these three letters of recommendation today.
[54]  If we do not have them, there will be many problems.
[55]  Many people are still in the denominations even though they have been meeting and breaking bread with us for many years.
[56]  It is true that they are brothers, but we cannot say that they are clear about the truth.
[57]  Brother Watchman Nee answered: If we go on a trip to visit several churches but we do not have a specific locality in which we plan to stay for a long while, we do not need to give our letter of recommendation to the brothers of any one locality.
[58]  4 April 1934 NEWS FROM THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE
[59]  The goal of writing the news of the conference is to give a brief report, by the grace of God, of the conference itself so that the brothers and sisters in every locality, who could not come to the conference, can give glory and thanks together with us to the blessed God.
[60]  Two months before the conference, it was announced in the prayer meeting in the church in Shanghai that there would be a third Overcomer Conference, and the brothers and sisters were asked to pray much for this matter.
[61]  From that time forward, the brothers and sisters in Shanghai prayed for this conference in the prayer meetings and in their individual prayer.
[62]  As the time for the conference drew near, the brothers in Shanghai discussed these matters in their brothers meeting: how to go to the train station and steamer docks to meet the brothers and sisters arriving from other localities for the conference; how to serve them in the matter of hospitality; and how to keep the order of the conference.
[63]  The place of the conference meetings was still 211-212 Wen-teh Lane, Hardoon Road, Shanghai.
[64]  Because the building is small, a tent was put up at the front door.
[65]  To the much beloved brothers in the Lord, Watchman Nee, Chang Kuang Jung, and Wu Wei:
[66]  When we were in Shanghai we were given the best hospitality in the matters of room and board.
[67]  This letter is very long, so we will print it in sections in different issues of this publication.
[68]  All denominations not only have a particular name, they also have a particular truth.
[69]  This does not mean that the truth they espouse, like baptism or justification by faith, is bad.
[70]  It means that taking a truth as the center of the church, as the center for the believers to be united around and separating themselves from the rest of the children of God is to be a denomination.
[71]  To our fellow member of Christ, Brother Kuang Jung:
[72]  Thank the Lord, He has raised up this publication so that all His children can communicate with each other and know the condition of each locality.
[73]  This is the record from after a table meeting.
[74]  Psalm 133:1: "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in unity!"
[75]  Today I see many brothers and sisters here and I feel very joyful.
[76]  I have been away from you for seven months, but in these seven months, I have never once found a meeting like the one here in Shanghai, so I often have thought how good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell together in unity.
[77]  So I often asked the Lord to raise up some brothers and sisters there, so we can meet together.
[78]  In spite of all these, there are many things that make me sad!
[79]  But they are all in the Lord and they are children of God, so we should still love them.
[80]  He did not speak of anything except the question of the church and leaving the denominations.
[81]  However, he kept asking and quizzing me, and he exhorted me, saying, "You are very good, but there is one thing that you do that is not good.
[82]  I told the brothers that if there was only one person here at our meeting, we still had to keep meeting because the Lord said, "Not abandoning our own assembling together."
[83]  When you went to Europe and America to give testimony upon the Lord's command, you went through Penang, Malaysia and had your picture taken with Brothers Yang and Cheng.
[84]  Brother Yang gave me a copy, and it is as if I have seen you, but I would like to meet you personally.
[85]  I had hoped that on your return journey you would pass through Ipoh, so I could receive your teachings face to face, and they could lead me on my spiritual path!
[86]  Then Brother Huang Pao Kuang came to our area to preach the gospel, and Brother Chang Ching Yuan gradually introduced us to what he had read in The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages and sometimes exchanged letters with us.
[87]  It was only through this preaching of the gospel that we came to know the salvation of the cross of Christ and were led by the Holy Spirit to believe in the Lord and receive life.
[88]  Brother Huang took the opportunity to resign, but then later the brothers asked him to stay, so he rented a house to live in. He opened a school to teach and continued working for the Lord.
[89]  In 1930 a believer in the Lord from the area of P'u Tung was hired as a preacher in a denomination in Shanghai.
[90]  In the spring of that year, he received enlightenment from the Lord's truth and felt that denominations were of man's will.
[91]  Brother Shen wrote saying that in Shanghai you began a Bible study on the nineteenth which meets every day.
[92]  Recently I have been asking the Lord to give me an opportunity to have contact with you often, so we can speak our hearts to each other and so I can receive your teaching and messages from the Lord as well as those of all the brothers.
[93]  I hope you will remember me often, praying for me and asking God to turn me from my foolishness so that I can testify for the Lord more and glorify His name.
[94]  I do not forget your work in my prayers, and I pray for you often, asking God to give you physical strength so you can bear the burden God has required you to bear.
[95]  I am one of the last workers raised up by the Lord, and I am advanced in years, so I do not have enough strength.
[96]  I often regret that I did not turn to the Lord earlier, but I delayed until today to receive a little light and revelation; such revelation has dispersed the clouds and fog so that I can now see the sky.
[97]  I received a copy of Collection of Newsletters the day before yesterday and realized the need for mutual fellowship.
[98]  When I first believed in the Lord, I met in Su Chia Tsui, which is about thirteen miles from here.
[99]  The second year, Brother Chen Yung Pao believed in the Lord, and we went to the meetings together.
[100]  To the brothers and sisters who pray to the Lord
[101]  From the Bible, we see, on the one hand, that the church is the house of God 1 Tim 3:15 , and on the other hand, that it is the Body of Christ Eph 1:23 .
[102]  According to the Bible, a local church only has elders and deacons.
[103]  The Bible does not only tell us that the command to baptize others was given to the disciples, it also shows us many examples of the disciples baptizing others.
[104]  In John 4:2 it says that "His disciples" baptized people.
[105]  The ones baptizing here were "disciples," not the apostles.
[106]  Furthermore, in the table meeting, we each fellowship with the Lord directly to remember Him; we do not need someone to stand between us and the Lord as a mediator.
[107]  Please read the preceding answer to the question concerning sects, especially the part about having names.
[108]  The building which we use for meetings does not need a name to differentiate itself, because the church of God is God's children, not the house they use to meet in. The building that is used for meetings is not the temple of God.
[109]  Moreover, we do not leave the denominations because we are proud and arrogant in our natural selves, wanting to be leaders and not willing to be restricted by others; nor is it because we are naturally stubborn and like to be individuals away from the crowd.
[110]  We leave the denominations because the flesh and the old man have already been crucified on the cross Gal 5:24; Rom 6:6 , because God wants us to put off the old man Eph 4:22 , and because we want to please God, to deal with the flesh, and put off the old man.
[111]  This is a letter Mr. Yun Feng Chan sent to three brothers in Singapore.
[112]  To my most beloved brothers in the Lord, Wang K'ai Sen, Yang Jen Chu, and Chang Chia Chi:
[113]  I have already read your letter which arrived yesterday, and I was informed that Brother Wang Yung Shih has been baptized into the Lord's name.
[114]  Because it was an inconvenient location, the brothers prayed specifically to the Lord to prepare a place where His children could meet together to worship the Father and to break the bread and drink the cup in remembrance of the Lord Jesus who loves us.
[115]  There is a town near here called Tun Shan Ma.
[116]  There are more than twenty brothers and sisters there.
[117]  When they hear that someone has believed in the Lord and does not burn paper money or incense and does not do other types of superstitious things, they are very surprised.
[118]  Many brothers and sisters who have fellowship with us have wanted to know about the condition of all the meetings in P'ing Yang, but they have not been able to know the details.
[119]  For the sake of fellowship in the Body, I must tell something of their condition so that all the brothers and sisters who love the Lord can know how the Lord raised up His work in P'ing Yang and can give thanks and praise to the only blessed God and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[120]  Praise and thank the Lord, in these past few years He has shined upon His desolated sanctuary with the light of His face so that we, the remnant who have escaped, could be raised up.
[121]  The Beginning of the Meeting in Fang Yen Hsia
[122]  This meeting turned from an Independent Church to meet in the Lord's name.
[123]  In the summer of 1932, there was a conference here.
[124]  The person who spoke at that conference did not mention the matter of the church.
[125]  But when the brothers received the light of the truth, they themselves saw that many things in the organization of the denominations were not according to the Bible.
[126]  They began to leave the denominations, drop the names of the meetings, then began practicing baptism and breaking bread, etc. Now there are more than thirty brothers and sisters who break bread together on the Lord's Day.
[127]  Then some brothers read many of the publications put out by the Gospel Book Room, and they received much light.
[128]  After that meeting, seven brothers rose up to be baptized they had already been sprinkled and at the same time began meeting to break bread as the Bible commands.
[129]  They had not been practicing this for long when a group of brothers and sisters who really love the Lord tasted some of the flavor of the joy from heaven.
[130]  A year ago there were no believers in the locality of Hou Ts'ang.
[131]  In the fall of last year, Brother Lee Shu Jen went there and rented a building for a gospel conference.
[132]  He was blessed by the Lord, and in no time, several lovely young men and women received the Lord and became Christians.
[133]  From that time, some brothers from the denominations also came over and began to break bread with them.
[134]  Now there are more than ten brothers and sisters in the table meeting, and more than thirty come to listen to the Word but do not break bread yet.
[135]  We two weak and useless ones want to describe by the Lord's grace how He raised up the table in Kulin and its condition so that the brothers and sisters will know and glorify God and our Lord together.
[136]  Brother Nee, when I had written to this point, I suddenly received Issue No. 47 of Notes on Scriptural Messages, "The Numbering of Spiritual Days." I read it and really felt both joyful and sad at the same time! I was sad that I do not know how much of my past years have been eaten away by the swarming locusts, the licking locusts, the consuming locusts, and the cutting locusts! I do not know how many of the days I have passed have been forgotten by God! I was very distressed about the number of days and years that I had wasted! But the Lord also promised to restore those years that were eaten up by the locusts.
[137]  We have not written you for a long time.
[138]  Thank the Lord's grace for His all-encompassing love!
[139]  When we were living a dry and tasteless spiritual life, and we seemed like sprouts in a long drought, He gave us the truth which is like anointing rain to comfort our hearts so we could stand on His Word and be strong.
[140]  I received your letter when I got to Honan.
[141]  Yes, every brother or sister who is clear about the Lord's light and who wants to go the way of the Lord should leave the denominations in reality and in name.
[142]  7 June 20, 1934 A LETTER FROM TAISHAN, KWANTUNG PROVINCE Incoming Letter
[143]  All the brothers and sisters in the meeting in Kung Ho City, Taishan have been blessed by God with peace.
[144]  I returned to Ch'ang-ch'un with Brother Chang Shun Tien, but I left him after a month.
[145]  Question: There is a newly saved woman here who has received the eternal life, but she has two husbands.
[146]  One lives away from home and works for others because they are poor ; the other is not a real husband but always lives in her house and receives his livelihood from her.
[147]  But I have not been purposely hiding anything; I was just immature and did not know how to love the brothers with the love of the Lord.
[148]  I know that He is my Head and each of us brothers and sisters are His members making up His one Body, so we should act together and should not hide ourselves.
[149]  Before my son went away, I knelt before the Lord and cried, not because my son was going to die, but because the brothers and sisters in the meetings of two localities, Chang Chia Yao and Yin Han Chuang, were all in an immature condition and did not have any knowledge of the Bible.
[150]  School is over now, and I do not have anything to do; therefore, I am writing this disorganized letter with the purpose of telling you, Brother Nee, and the brothers and sisters in Shanghai how I was led by the Lord and how I want to completely enter into Him.
[151]  We were both saved by the blood of the Lord Jesus so we could escape that great perdition.
[152]  We are supported by the Lord's holy hand daily in order that we can walk the way of the cross in this world.
[153]  But I am most lonely and desolate because there is no brother to contact me in this place where messengers of Satan daily worship Buddha.
[154]  Sometimes I testify of the Lord to them, but they always debate with me and refuse to accept Him.
[155]  I do not know when the Spirit of the Lord will work in their hearts to save them from darkness.
[156]  For the sake of the Lord's love, please announce to the brothers and sisters to pray for this useless little child of God, that he could overcome the world through the Lord's death and glorify the Lord in everything.
[157]  Greetings to the brothers who labor and walk together with us in each locality:
[158]  After the Third Overcomer Conference this past January, the co-workers from the various localities had a meeting in Shanghai.
[159]  In that meeting most of the co-workers expressed the hope that a written testimony could be issued solely for the preaching of the gospel.
[160]  We also hope that every time there are baptisms in the meetings of each locality, the co-workers or responsible brothers and sisters will pay attention to testimonies that can help people and will ask the brother or sister to write out his or her testimony of salvation.
[161]  In regard to your first kind of spiritual condition, it is not good, nor is it bad.
[162]  8 July 7, 1934 THE CONDITION OF THE MEETING IN HANGCHOW, CHEKIANG PROVINCE
[163]  He has gradually begun to call His chosen children into His name in Hangchow where the church is in such desolation.
[164]  On March 19 of last year, we had three brothers and two sisters.
[165]  We came together in Ch'ing Chun Road to begin to pray that the Lord would establish His table.
[166]  Although I have failed many times, I believe that God is causing me to learn some lessons.
[167]  Thank and praise the Lord for leading me on to His proper track.
[168]  Thank the Lord, He has blessed our recent work.
[169]  3 We asked the Lord to work with us to bind the enemy and stop his actions and to release the brothers and sisters who were bound by the enemy.
[170]  On the one hand, we notified all the sisters in all the localities of northern Kiangsu that whoever could learn to read should come to learn before April 7, and on the other hand, we invited the responsible brothers, sisters, and co-workers to come to Yi Lin on May 7 for a conference.
[171]  As the sisters' conference was about to end, the enemy caused the children of God to suffer.
[172]  He made Miss Chin, one of the sisters responsible for the work, sick.
[173]  There was a sudden rain on the night of May 6.
[174]  On the seventh the weather cleared, and it did not rain until the evening of the seventeenth.
[175]  We give glory to the Almighty for what happened, and we ask God for three great necessities in the future: 1 The meeting in Yi Lin lacks the funds for the purchase of the hall, even though the hall is appropriate; 2 there are many brothers who have lost their jobs, and we need to know how to meet their needs; and 3 we need schools where the children of the believers can study.
[176]  Although I have not communicated with you much since parting with you in Shanghai, I remember you always in the Lord.
[177]  Dear brother, I truly thank God always for you.
[178]  When I pray, I also mention your work for our gracious Lord.
[179]  May our Lord Jesus Christ strengthen you and bless your work by faith, your sufferings of love, and your endurance of hope.
[180]  Brother, I truly thank the Lord because He is leading us step by step.
[181]  Despite the fact that the world is dark and the church is degraded, thank the Lord that He has chosen and called His children in every place to rise up and testify for the truth.
[182]  Brothers and sisters, since we have received the Lord's love and His light, should we not be in fear and trembling as we carry out the Lord's commission?
[183]  May the Lord keep us and lead us so that from now on we will serve Him more faithfully and give all glory to His holy name.
[184]  I am sure that all the brothers and sisters care for the condition of the church here.
[185]  Brothers and sisters, I not only ask you to care for the pioneering work and to pray, but even more I ask you to pray for me, your weak brother, that I would have the utterance to boldly speak the mysteries of the gospel according to the ministry entrusted to me.
[186]  I received both your telegram and letter and have read them both.
[187]  Thank the Lord because in these last days He has personally cared for us small ones.
[188]  In 1931 the Lord sent His servants to Wenchow to preach about the truth of the church.
[189]  So we gathered a few of the brothers and sisters who were in one accord and met upstairs in a brother's house in Nan T'ang to worship and break bread in remembrance of the Lord.
[190]  We saw that they had a heart for the Lord and thought that perhaps the Lord would raise up His work among them to revive His children.
[191]  Greetings in love to the beloved brother in the Lord,
[192]  Although I am very foolish, the Lord is happy to entrust me with a little of His messages here and there.
[193]  Some brothers who are in one accord awaiting the Lord's return feel deeply in prayer that what the church lacks today is not talent, method, or work but a revelation from the Holy Spirit, a spiritual living, and the cultivation of the truth.
[194]  For this reason, in our prayer before the throne of the Father, we have decided to have an Overcomer Conference to support the brothers and sisters in the Lord.
[195]  We invite all the co-workers throughout China, those who walk in one accord in this way and who desire the truth, as well as all the brothers and sisters who pursue after the Lord's desire to come to the conference in Hangchow.
[196]  The Bible study meeting is prepared especially for those brothers and sisters who desire to pursue the truth and please the Lord.
[197]  9 August 23, 1934 A LETTER FROM TSINAN, SHANTUNG PROVINCE
[198]  We thank the Lord for sending His servant, Brother Chang Kuang Jung, to Tsinan for the past two months.
[199]  You must be very busy now because the work in the Gospel Book Room has increased.
[200]  But I know that you are not for yourself but for the Lord and the brothers.
[201]  Brother Chang Kuang Jung is here and has a Bible study every evening concerning the matter of the church because the brothers in Hangchow need this kind of help now.
[202]  Your answer is according to the teachings of the Bible.
[203]  However, the word in 1 Timothy 2:12 is "teach" in the original Greek.
[204]  When the meeting in Ta Ch'iao began, there was an old brother, Mr. Shan Hsia Ch'ang, who was from So Chia Chi, Fu Ning.
[205]  We also hope that the brothers and sisters who love us will pray for us and help us weak and little ones stand firm so that we do not shame the Lord's name.
[206]  Thank the Lord that he has rendered us much help in our fellowship.
[207]  Now we have decided with him that we will have a few days of prayer first to see how the Lord leads.
[208]  We especially ask the brothers and sisters in Shanghai to remember the Lord's work in Chefoo in their prayers and to remember His faithful servant especially his health .
[209]  Peace to my fellow member of the Body of Christ,
[210]  On the seventh of this month, six brothers and four sisters were baptized into the Lord's name together.
[211]  Perhaps I can visit the brothers and sisters in Chu Chia Yueh Tze soon.
[212]  Although we have never met, I have known you for a long time in the Lord.
[213]  Thank the Lord, when I had no way out, He showed me the right way.
[214]  Because of this we were weak in life, and sometimes we fellowshipped with the brothers and sisters in the denominations.
[215]  I hope you can write a letter to the brothers and sisters in the fellowship in Shanghai to explain the situation here, so they can pray for us and give thanks before the Lord.
[216]  Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord:
[217]  We praise and thank the Lord because He has called some to meet in His name in Hsi Mao Wang Chuang which is to the northeast ten miles of the Kuang Jau county seat.
[218]  After carefully studying the matter of denominations, we have found that it is not only not in the Bible, but it is also forbidden by the Bible, because Christ is not divided 1 Cor 1:10-13; Gal 5:20 .
[219]  Through the publication Collection of Newsletters your brothers in Hua She have come to know how God uses His faithful servants to work in every place.
[220]  We weak, little ones have received much help from Collection of Newsletters, but we also feel very ashamed because we have seen that we are very immature in many areas.
[221]  May the Lord preserve you brothers in Shanghai in peace and may your bodies and spirits remain healthy in this very hot summer.
[222]  I was able to attend only one meeting of the Third Overcomer Conference.
[223]  I received the important message on "God's Center" which gave me a deeper knowledge of the Lord.
[224]  I really thank the Lord deeply for His grace.
[225]  In this message, you spoke one word which touched me: "Some people listen to the word of truth secretly, read the books which testify to the word of the truth, and receive some light and then follow the Lord.
[226]  I hope you will pray for me when you receive my letter that I may keep the will of God and walk in His way because I feel that I am an extremely weak person.
[227]  To our brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman Nee:
[228]  The people in the denominations here often say that our meeting is not according to the Bible because it is not organized and because in the Bible there are the titles of elder and deacon.
[229]  Although we have the reality, it gives people an excuse to refuse us because we do not have the names.
[230]  If there are people in the meetings that are like elders and deacons, would it be all right to openly acknowledge them before the brothers and sisters and give them the title?
[231]  If a list of these names could be printed and sent to each locality, then when brothers and sisters travel with letters of recommendation from the responsible brothers, whoever sees the letters would know immediately whether the letter is authentic and where they are from.
[232]  In 1925 Brother Watchman Nee came to the denomination here to lead a revival meeting.
[233]  Brother Wang T'an Ch'i was revived and Brother Teng Chu Ch'in received salvation and was later baptized and left the denominations.
[234]  The Holy Spirit caused Brother Kuo, his father Kuo Wan Ch'ing, Brother Wu Feng, and the rest of the brothers to understand from the Bible the error of the Seventh-day Adventists and to see that if they wanted to walk in the Lord's way they had to leave all the traditions of man.
[235]  Although we had only a heart to obey the Lord the brothers and sisters left but not because they hated those in the denominations; moreover, Brother Kuo was the son-in-law of a famous pastor in a large denomination in Fukien , when we started the meetings, we were still very immature with regard to the truth of the church.
[236]  Every Tuesday we preach the gospel in our homes.
[237]  On Wednesday afternoon there is a sisters' prayer meeting.
[238]  We want the brothers and sisters who walk together with us in the Lord's way in all the localities to know the general situation, and we also ask you all to pray for us because we are still immature.
[239]  may you have peace and may you receive much grace and mercy in the great love of the Lord:
[240]  Thank our Lord that He purchased us with His priceless blood so we could pass from death to life and be one in Him.
[241]  Although we are not together and there are some whom we have never met or seen, we are all members together in His Body.
[242]  Because we are members one of another, we have the boldness to report something to the brothers and sisters of the condition of the meeting in the Lord's name in Soochow.
[243]  The sisters did not know that the brothers were having such meetings, so they could only go to Shanghai one Lord's Day a month to break bread and fulfill their desire to remember the Lord.
[244]  On the one hand, we thanked the Lord for His grace that we could meet brothers and sisters in the Lord, and on the other hand, we asked the Lord Himself to enable us to have His own table in Soochow.
[245]  The Lord used His own love the length, breadth, height, and depth of which cannot be to draw many brothers and sisters who loved Him to come one by one to meet with us and break bread.
[246]  I would not have sent them to you except for the request you made in your publication that any news of the work should be communicated as much as possible.
[247]  If there are, please notify me so I can ask the brothers and sisters who love the Lord in Ya Yang to pray.
[248]  To my dear brother in the Lord, Brother Wu Sheng:
[249]  I have been lying in bed all day for the past few days.
[250]  I met with Brother Wang Yu T'ing for several days.
[251]  I received and read the card that you sent before.
[252]  I have been so long in answering, please forgive me for this!
[253]  Because the Lord has not opened a way to us in the environment and in other needs, we could not hold it in July but waited for God's way.
[254]  Concerning the articles for Collection of Newsletters, I personally hope that in the future there will be more news about how the brothers and sisters have consecrated to the Lord, about how they have obeyed the Lord and have taken the Lord as Head over all things, about how they have overcome their dryness and entered into the more abundant life, and about how they were delivered from a sinful life and have overcome sin.
[255]  I am really fearful that in every locality there are brothers who, being limited in understanding and spiritual experiences before God, only have a little knowledge about outward matters such as baptism, head covering, and denominations, and exhaust their effort to publicize these matters.
[256]  By doing so, they cause outsiders to misunderstand us, thinking that we only emphasize these outward things and that we do not exalt Jesus Christ as Lord.
[257]  To the brothers who are my co-believers in Christ!
[258]  Since I have decided to separate myself from the co-workers in Jehol Brethren or C.M.M.L., Christian Mission to Many Lands , my goal in writing this letter is not to criticize them.
[259]  I believe that by doing this I am placing myself in a better position to practice the proper fellowship with all the children of God, especially with those who obey the principles of the New Testament teachings and patterns.
[260]  According to what I have seen in my past three years in China, I know deeply that a gospel region controlled by one person with the help of salaried Chinese assistants almost all of their work receives the supply of foreign money cannot replace a church that is according to the teachings and patterns of the New Testament.
[261]  I believe that if I continue to receive monetary support indirectly from a central organization with authority as the paper The Response does, which uses the money received from subscriptions to help the missionaries connected with it and do not directly receive offerings from believers in simple meetings that are according to the Bible three and a half years ago they gave me to the work in China , I will be one who does not practice what he preaches.
[262]  In the seventh issue of Collection of Newsletters, I read Brother David Hsu's letter from Ningpo and the editor's response.
[263]  I was led by the Holy Spirit and am willing to answer the sisters' question concerning head covering according to the light received from the Lord.
[264]  If we take Christ's mind as our own and have a heart of obedience, we will be able to receive a clear answer from the Lord to any question.
[265]  May the Lord shine His light on us so we can obey and stand in the position we were meant to stand in to serve our God and our Lord Jesus Christ.
