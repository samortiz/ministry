   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Appreciating God's Care for Him</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sustaining Him on His Sickbed</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Making All His Bed in His Illness</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>David also appreciated God's care for him sustaining him on his sickbed and making all his bed in his illness 41:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, this is poetic writing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But do you believe that when David was sick, God came to take care of him just like a nurse, making all his bed?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely God takes care of us, but the apostle Paul did not write anything in his Epistles to tell us that God took care of him like a nurse to sustain him on his sickbed and to make his bed in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For David to speak in this way indicates that he was too much in the self.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. Referring to His Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>and Integrity Again</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>David referred to his righteousness and integrity again in 40:9-10 and 41:12.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>D. Realizing and Confessing</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His Iniquities and Sins</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>David realized and confessed his iniquities and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Psalm 40:12 says, "For evils encompass me until they cannot be counted;/My iniquities have so overtaken me/That I cannot see;/They are more numerous than the hairs of my head;/Thus my heart fails me."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Psalm 41:4 says, "I said, O Jehovah, be gracious to me;/Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To make confession of our sins is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When David was writing Psalms 40 and 41, he was surrounded by his enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He indicated that all his enemies encompassing him were evils which had become so numerous that they could not be counted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, his iniquities were so numerous that he could not see.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was overtaken and bent over by the weight of his iniquities, and the number of his iniquities surpassed the number of the hairs on his head.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows us that he was altogether in a very desperate situation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Enemies were surrounding him, and iniquities were suppressing him.</S>
