   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MATTHEW MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE THE UNVEILING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE KINGDOM S MYSTERIES 5</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible the number seven is composed of six plus one, three plus four, or four plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 are made up of three plus four.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the seven parables in Matthew 13 are made up of four plus three.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first four parables were given in the boat in the open air.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are the parables of the sower, the tares, the mustard seed, and the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The last three were given privately to the disciples in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The previous three parables concerning the outward appearance of the kingdom were spoken publicly by the heavenly King in the boat to the crowds vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2, 34 , whereas the three parables following these were given privately in the house to the disciples v. 36 . This indicates that the things covered by these three parables are more hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In each of the first four parables there was something related to eating.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this we see that the first four parables cover the matter of food.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s intention is to have a people on earth to be the constituents of His kingdom, and these people must be like food that is good to satisfy both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the enemy came in to plant tares among the wheat to frustrate the growth of the wheat and to damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nevertheless some wheat has grown up and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, in the fourth parable we have the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fine flour composing the meal comes from wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason the Lord Jesus sowed wheat seeds was that God desires to have fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Satan, God s enemy, sowed tares among the wheat to frustrate its growth, God cannot be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some wheat grew to produce grain, and the grain was ground into fine flour to make a loaf.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While this was taking place, Satan caused the mustard herb, intended to be a source of food, to grow abnormally into a big tree and thereby to lose its function of producing food.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, it became an evil lodging place.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a picture of Christendom today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the various Christian organizations we see big buildings, offices, and complex hierarchies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We see the branches of the big tree, but nothing of the fine flour or the mustard herb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the fourth parable, Satan then took the further step of adding leaven to the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see Satan s subtlety.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Firstly, he sowed tares among the wheat to frustrate the growth of the wheat; secondly, he caused the mustard herb to grow abnormally and to lose its function; thirdly, seeing that some wheat was produced to make fine flour for a loaf to satisfy God and man, Satan added leaven to the meal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The first four parables are all related to the farm.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1 Corinthians 3:9 Paul says, Ye are God s farm, ye are God s building Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>. In this chapter we see that God s farm eventually produces gold, silver, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How mysterious it is that the produce of God s farm becomes gold, silver, and precious stones, the materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God s farm produces the things of life, and these things of life become the materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, God s farm is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the first four parables in Matthew we have the life growing, and in the next parable we have the treasure hidden in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The treasure must be made up of gold, silver, and precious stones, probably mainly precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the following parable we find the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Jerusalem is built with gold, precious stones, and pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Gold is the material of the city proper, and precious stones and pearl are the two other building materials for the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the first four parables the Lord revealed the life that grows Christ into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the next two parables He revealed the matter of transformation for building.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This brings us back to the basic thought of the Bible life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The parables in Matthew 13 reveal the matters of life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Life is Christ Himself as the seed sown into our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This life grows within us, growing Christ into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The grow ing of this life eventually produces precious stones and pearls.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After spending much time on Matthew 13, I found that its basic thought is the same as that of 1 Corinthians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In both chapters we have God s farm and God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The first four parables are related to God s farm for growing Christ into the kingdom, and the following two parables are related to transformation for producing precious materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we are not impressed with this matter, we shall not be able to understand the fifth and sixth parables.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have consulted a number of books on Matthew 13, but none of them touch the depth of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>None of the interpretations given in those books satisfied us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even D. M. Panton says that the treasure hidden in the field is the kingdom and that the pearl is righteousness, for in 6:33 we are told to seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The teaching prevalent among the Brethren did not get into the depth of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although D. M. Panton saw that the treasure hid in the field referred to the kingdom, he was not clear about the pearl.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this message we need to consider these two parables in a definite way.</S>
