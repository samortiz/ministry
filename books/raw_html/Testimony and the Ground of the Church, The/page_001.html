<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>The church is the eternal purpose of God and the goal of God&rsquo;s work in time. Therefore, we must know the church in order to understand God&rsquo;s plan and work in the universe. The church has a content and function in reality, and it also has an outward appearance and ground in practicality. These two aspects, one inward and the other outward, match each other and are indispensable. According to its content in reality, the church is a mystery that requires a heavenly revelation from God. However, due to the church&rsquo;s degradation in the last two thousand years, the outward expression of the church in practicality has been changed beyond recognition. As a result, people either are ignorant of or filled with misunderstanding concerning the church. Thus, there is a great need for spiritual insight.</p>
<p>During a conference in Taipei in 1957, Witness Lee released numerous messages concerning the testimony and the ground of the church to explain the inward and outward aspects of the church in great detail. Although more than a decade passed before their publication in 1971, these messages are a precious, comprehensive, and systematic guide to those who have a heart to know the church. May Christ, the Head of the church, bless this book and lead His people all over the earth to recover the testimony and the ground of the church to hasten His return!</p>
