   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We must note the word "behold" in Genesis 1:31.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is its meaning?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we have purchased a certain object with which we are particularly satisfied, we turn it around with pleasure and look it over well.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is what it means to behold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God did not just casually "look" upon all that He had made and see that it was good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, He "beheld" everything which He had made and saw that it was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to take note that God was there at the creation "beholding" what He had made.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word "rested" is the declaration that God was satisfied, that God delighted in what He had done; it proclaims that God's purpose was attained and His good pleasure was accomplished to the fullest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His work was perfected to such an extent that it could not have been made better.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason God commanded the Israelites to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God was after something.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God was seeking something to satisfy Himself, and He attained it; therefore, He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the meaning of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not that man should purchase fewer things or walk less miles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Sabbath tells us that God had a heart's desire, a requirement to satisfy Himself, and a work had to be done to fulfill His heart's desire and demand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since God has obtained what He was after, He is at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not a matter of a particular day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Sabbath tells us that God has fulfilled His plan, attained His goal, and satisfied His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is One who demands satisfaction, and He is also One who can be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After God has what He desires, He rests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What then brought rest to God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What was it that gave Him such satisfaction?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the six days of creation there were light, air, grass, herbs, and trees; there were the sun, the moon, and the stars; there were fish, birds, cattle, creeping things, and beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But in all these God did not find rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Finally there was man, and God rested from all His work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of the creation before man was preparatory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All of God's expectations were focused upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God gained a man, He was satisfied and He rested.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us read Genesis 1:27-28 again: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now read Genesis 1:31 with Genesis 2:3: "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good....And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God had a purpose, and this purpose was to gain man man with authority to rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only the realization of this purpose could satisfy God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If this could be obtained, all would be well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the sixth day God's purpose was achieved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good...and he rested on the seventh day from all his work."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God's purpose and expectation were attained; He could stop and rest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's rest was based upon man who would rule.</S>
