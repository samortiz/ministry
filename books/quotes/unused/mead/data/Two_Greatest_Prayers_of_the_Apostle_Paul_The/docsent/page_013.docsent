   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Living by Our New Person</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is wonderful to be born again, but after our new birth, we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To grow simply means to have more of Christ added and worked into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Formerly we were people in the soul, but now we must be people in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our soul, our former person, has already "been crucified with Christ" Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to take this fact and put it into our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Realizing that our former person has been crucified, we should not live in that person, by that person, or with that person anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to deny our former person which the Bible calls "the old man" Rom 6:6; Eph 4:22; Col 3:9 and "the outward man" 2 Cor 4:16 , and we have to live by our new person, "the inner man" Eph 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to realize that we are now another person, the new person in our spirit with Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our person, our spirit, and Christ's life are now one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This new person, our spirit plus Christ as life, is even our personality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now our personality is not in the soul but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not live in the old person anymore, nor should we allow or permit the old person to take any action.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to live by the new person.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How do we apply this in our daily living?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose a brother intends to go to a department store to buy something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He should not check whether that is the Lord's will or not.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first thing he has to check is whether his going is being initiated from his soul or from his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is it being initiated by his former person or by his present person, by the old man or the new man, by the soulish man or the inner man?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It has to be initiated by his new person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It may be easy for us to learn this doctrine, but in most of our living, we may still be absolutely in our old man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To go to the department store to buy something is not bad or evil, but that may still be an activity of our former person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although we are Christians in name, we may still be living in our old person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may do things according to our consideration of whether a thing is right or wrong, good or evil, and not according to the principle of whether it is something of the old person or something of the new person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We, the reborn ones, may very rarely live in our new person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God has no intention to ask you to be a good man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's intention is for you to live in the new person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not matter whether you buy something or not, whether you go shopping or not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What does matter is who goes, the former person or the present one, the person in the soul or the person in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the person in the soul goes, Christ is not there, but if the person in the spirit goes, Christ goes, because in the spirit you are one with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The new person is Christ as life in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When these two, Christ as life and your spirit, are together as one, you have the personality of your new person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You need to see that you were not only saved but also reborn to be another person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Formerly, you were one kind of person, but you have been regenerated to be an absolutely different person.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You were once a person in your soul.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether that person was good or bad does not mean much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may have been born gentle, mild, patient, kind, slow, and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>People always consider that this kind of person is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It may even be hard for you to lose your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everybody would like this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the other hand, I might have been born wild, tough, rough, and quick-tempered, without any patience.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>No one would like me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But whether you were born good or bad does not mean anything because we all need to be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you were born bad, you need to be reborn, but even if you were born good, you still need to be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regardless of our race, nationality, or natural disposition, we all have to be reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this rebirth, we are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After our rebirth, we should no longer live by that old person but absolutely by the new person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The problem is that, even after our rebirth, we still live by our old person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We always consider whether a thing is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If it is right, we will do it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If it is wrong, we will not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Thus, our standard of being a Christian is not a person but a behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the standard today in Christianity, but this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our standard must be a person, not a behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether a matter is right or wrong, good or bad, we should only care for one thing: who is going to do it?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is our old person going to do it or our new person?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not a matter of what you are going to do but of who is going to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The real subjective aspect of the work of the cross is to cross out your old person.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is no more I, the old person, but Christ, the new person Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not a matter of adjusting or improving your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is a matter of shifting your being from the old person to the new person.</S>
