THE PRESENT PRACTICE</h2>
<p>In October of 1984, when I returned to Taiwan to study how to change the system, I emphasized repeatedly the need to discard the old things and adopt the new things. In particular, I focused on the way we met and the methods with which we worked. At that time I &ldquo;blew the trumpet&rdquo; in a clear and loud way. The proclamation was clear, and the explanation was plain. I also pointed out that since the practice of the new way was in its experimental stage, we were not clear about the way ahead of us. We had never taken such a way before, and we needed to study it thoroughly. For this reason, none of our ways was set. Even our co-workers had to try out different ways to meet. Now that a year and a half has passed, we should be able to do a little evaluation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Slowness of the Process<br />
of Changing the System</h2>
<p>First, we must realize that the process of changing the system is very slow. This is the reason that we are having this training at this time. I believe every saint agrees with our proposal to change the system. In practice, however, do we all agree that we need to spread the gospel, meet in the homes, build up the small groups, and teach the truth? I believe all of us would readily agree that we need to beget, nourish, and teach. To spread the gospel is to beget. To build up the small groups is to nourish, and to impart the truth is to teach. We are not forced to do the work of begetting, nourishing, and teaching. As long as we are men, and as long as we have a family, live in a society, and have a nation, we need to beget, nourish, and teach. In order to be a man, we need to beget; in order to have a family, we need to nourish; and in order to have a healthy society and a strong nation, we need to teach. These are clear and reasonable things that we must do.</p>
<p>We may agree with the new way, and we may agree to the change of our system. However, in practice we may still hold on to the habit of the old way and abide by the old system. In my hometown, four years after the Chinese Revolution, the people still kept their pigtail hairstyle. Some had a difficult struggle before they would give up their pigtail. I tell you this to show you that it is not an easy thing to drop the oldness and pick up the new things. At the end of the Ching Dynasty, the Chinese leader Sun Yat-sen promoted the revolution. He had to struggle for a few decades before the revolution finally succeeded. Actually, the revolution only changed the form of government and ousted the imperial dynasty; there was no real change in politics and society as a whole. Later, men like Yuan Shih-kai and Chang Shun rose up and attempted to restore the imperial dynasty. China went through a civil war for a few decades. Countless numbers of people appeared and disappeared from the political scene, but the real revolution was still not realized. The common Chinese people still held on to their oldness. It is difficult to change bad habits.</p>
<p>I hope that the brothers and sisters will see that since we have made up our mind to change the system and have resolved to be renewed, we must change all our ways and be renewed thoroughly. We cannot carry on business as usual and follow the old rules. Unless we make a strong resolution and abandon everything old, we cannot succeed in changing the system. When I was young, my brother and I went to study in an American school. Some students already had adopted Western-style clothing, but we were still wearing the Chinese long blue gown and cloth shoes. Although we were studying in a Western-style school and were learning English, we dared not speak English at home for fear that we would be accused of being influenced by the West. We were even afraid to speak in proper Mandarin, preferring instead to use the local dialect and native colloquialisms. The more unsophisticated we acted, the safer we felt. Although we had studied diligently and learned much, and although a bright future awaited us, the strong tradition still tenaciously held to us. This shows that it is not an easy thing to adopt something new.</p>
<p>Now we have all seen the vision, and we are all clear about the practice, which is to spread the gospel, build up the small groups, and teach the truth. However, we cannot merely shout slogans. We must have the determination to carry things through to the end. Of course, at the beginning we may not do a good job. It always takes a period of time to study and improve before we can succeed in adopting anything new. When the Chinese first immigrated to the United States, they did not speak English well, but as long as they were willing to improve, they eventually picked up the language. Here, in the previous weeks I visited three places. In some places I saw much improvement, but in other places people were still holding on to the old things. This proves that after a year and a half we are still not that absolute in adopting the new system.</p>
<p>Recently the church purchased a piece of land in Lin-ko. Our plan is to build a big meeting hall there. The news spread to all the countries, and in the United States more than two hundred fifty people have applied to come see that land and observe our meetings. When I was in the United States, I learned that even some from the churches in Europe wanted to visit us. After some fellowship, I agreed to give them a quota of four people. Those from the United States are not allowed to come at all. On the surface I told them that we wanted to be spared the trouble of hospitality and of taking care of the differences in habit and food of foreigners. Acts 6:1-6 does speak about this inconvenience. Actually, I have other reasons for refusing them. I know that they all want to come to observe how we are changing the system and adopting the new way. However, we are still groping with the proper way to meet in the small groups. We still do not know how to teach the truth. What do we have to show them? All the churches think that Taipei is in the third heaven. Actually, we are hardly a few feet off the ground, and we can easily fall back to the ground at this point in time. This is the reason I do not want them to come. I say this as an exhortation. We must be absolute in our endeavor. Since we have decided that we will change the system, and since we have put this matter into practice, we should be thorough and absolute in our work. Surely at the beginning it will be somewhat messy and not so proper, but in the end we will succeed.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
