<h2 class="head1">BY EXERCISING YOUR SPIRIT ALL THE WAY</h2>
<p>We should speak by exercising our spirit all the way. Many times when we speak, we disregard our spirit. During the course of our speaking, we may only exercise our spirit when we come to a point which we prefer. Our speaking, however, should not change like the seasons. When we open our mouths to speak, we must exercise our spirits from the first word. Otherwise, we are not qualified to speak. We must speak all the way not only in our spirit but also by exercising our spirit. This is important and it makes a difference.</p>
<p>To exercise your spirit does not always mean that you shout. By your experience you know what it is to speak without the spirit, and you also know what it is to speak with the spirit. These points for our speaking require our exercise and practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING TELLING SEA STORIES</h2>
<p>In our speaking we should avoid telling &ldquo;sea stories.&rdquo; Some try to lay a foundation for the point they are trying to make by telling a long story, and many times they do this without hitting the subject of their testimony. You do not need to tell these sea stories. To give a testimony is not to give a message. In giving a testimony about your history with the Lord you may simply say three sentences. This is enough to cover the entire story. Then the listeners will be happy. They will not be so heavily burdened with a long sea story.</p>
<p>Sometimes the brothers may have to tell the person who is giving a sea story to stop and give time for others to share. It is very hard and not so polite to stop someone while they speak in the meeting. This always hurts people&rsquo;s feelings. However, everyone should consider that there may only be an hour and a half for many people to speak, and a sea story takes too much time. We have seen some who speak in a lengthy way in every meeting they attend. It seems that they have no sensation of time; they only care for their speaking. We are not outside of time. We must care for the hours, minutes, and seconds. We must learn to be limited by time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING ERRORS IN TRUTH</h2>
<p>We must avoid errors in truth when we speak. It is very easy for us to be mistaken. I may make mistakes in my speaking, but I will not publish any message without polishing or revising it. In this polishing and revising, I make many corrections. Learn to speak the truth. If you do not have the assurance in giving numbers or other details, you had better not do it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING EXPOSING OTHERS</h2>
<p>Avoid exposing others in your speaking. It is easy for us to expose someone, even in our testimony, but it is altogether not profitable or helpful. It only damages the situation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING ANGER IN SPEAKING</h2>
<p>You must avoid anger in speaking. If you are angry, you must not speak. Speaking in anger kills the situation and kills your speaking spirit. Sometimes someone may interrupt your speaking. This may easily make you angry, but learn to hold back your anger, and never speak in anger. At other times someone in the audience may ask you a very peculiar question while you speak. This kind of peculiar question also stirs up people&rsquo;s anger. Some who listen to your speaking may not like it and may rise up and walk out. Do not be bothered or touched by that. When you are speaking, do not let anything bother you. Do not focus your attention on any distracting element in the meeting. Continue to speak in a pleasant way, avoiding anger in your speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AVOIDING LENGTHY SPEAKING</h2>
<p>Try to avoid lengthy speaking. This does not mean that you should speak in such a short way that people will have difficulty understanding you. Your speaking should be very easy for people to understand. Some brothers and sisters speak like they are sending a telegram. This is wrong. It is better to lengthen this kind of speaking, but if you speak too long, this is also not good.</p>
