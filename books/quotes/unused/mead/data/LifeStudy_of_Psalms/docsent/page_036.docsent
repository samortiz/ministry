   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this message I would like to ask if we consider ourselves as babes and sucklings?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps some of us have a doctor's degree, or others are high school seniors.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are we seniors, or are we sucklings?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you would ask me, I would say that I am the smallest suckling.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the kingdom of God, there is no old person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus told people, "Truly I say to you, Unless you turn and become like little children, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens" Matt 18:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He also said, "Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens" 19:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord stressed that to participate in the kingdom of the heavens, we must be like little children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the people who are in the kingdom of the heavens are as babes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A brother may be over sixty years old, but in God's kingdom, he is a suckling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Psalm 8 is poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Poetic writing should not be understood in a mere physical and literal way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to understand the terms according to a poetic way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Babes are not the real babes, and sucklings are not the real sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These are the children of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the people who are in the kingdom of the heavens are either babes or sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we consider that we are people with a high degree or status, that we have a doctor's degree, that we are seniors, we are not in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The brothers and sisters who are seniors in high school should not take this standing in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not be seniors, but sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The psalmist means that we, the children of God, all are babes and sucklings, yet God could cause us to praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Psalm 8:2 says that the Lord has established strength out of the mouths of babes and sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Seemingly, strength does not refer to something that comes out of the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord quoted this verse in Matthew 21:16, He used the word praise instead of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Weaker ones in themselves cannot praise.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To cry or weep does not require strength, but to praise requires strength.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we gossip, argue, or reason with people, that does not require strength.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But without strength, we cannot praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some praises may come out of our mouth, but they cannot be considered as perfected praises, because they are not so full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Praises should be full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times when the saints are praising the Lord, we can see the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Septuagint version of the Psalms translated the Hebrew word for strength into praise in Psalm 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This translation was quoted by the Lord in Matthew 21:16.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that the Lord admitted that this translation was right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The scholars who translated the Old Testament into Greek for the Septuagint did have some kind of spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>To praise is to have the strength in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God can work in His redemption to such an extent that the weakest ones and the smallest ones can have the strength to praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God has established this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Hebrew word for established is a hard word to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the Lord's quotation in Matthew 21:16, it says that He has "perfected" praise out of the mouths of the babes and sucklings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Psalm 8 says that He established strength out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, but the Lord Jesus quoted it by saying that He perfected praise.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is our praise perfect?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to admit that our praise is altogether imperfect.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Psalm 8 is not a long psalm, but it is a completed, perfected, and perfect psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are short of strength, we cannot praise.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not have the extra strength, we cannot have a completed, perfected, and perfect praise.</S>
