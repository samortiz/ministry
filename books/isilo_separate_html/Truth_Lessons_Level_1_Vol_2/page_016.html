The Little Horn in Daniel 8</h2><p>In Lesson Twelve, volume one, which covered the captivity and the prophets in captivity, the great image in Daniel 2 and the visions in chapters seven through twelve were mentioned. Daniel 2 describes the great image in King Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s dream; chapter seven covers the vision of the four beasts emerging from the sea; chapter eight speaks of the clash between the ram and the he-goat; chapter eleven cites the things related to the southern and northern kings. What the little horn did in Daniel 8:9-14 and what the king from the north performed in 11:21-32a both refer to the same thing.</p><p>The great image in chapter two is of four parts: the head, the breast and the arms, the belly and the thighs, and the legs (including the ten toes). The fourth part is first divided into two legs and then into ten toes. The following are the ages signified by the first three parts as well as the two legs: the head refers to the Babylonian Empire (605-539 B.C.); the breast and the arms represent the Median and Persian Empire (549-330 B.C.), which, although Media and Persia are likened to the two arms, was one kingdom; the belly and the thighs symbolize the Greek Empire established by the Macedonians (336-323 B.C.); the two legs of the great image allude to the eastern and western Roman Empires (30 B.C.-474 A.D.). All of these, except that which is typified by the ten toes, have been fulfilled in history.</p><p>The four beasts in chapter seven are equivalent to the four sections of the great image in chapter two. The first beast corresponds to the head of the image; the second, to its breast and arms; the third, to its belly and thighs; and the fourth, to its legs and ten toes. The ram and the he-goat in chapter eight parallel the second and third beasts in chapter seven. Thus, the he-goat equals the third beast as well as the third part of the great image. This he-goat has four horns, and out of one of them comes forth a little horn. According to history, the ram signifies Persia and the he-goat symbolizes Greece. G. H. Pember, in his writings on the prophecies, says that signs of a ram could be found everywhere in Persia, especially in its capital. Ancient Greece also abounded with signs of a goat. The Bible symbolizes Persia by a ram and Greece by a he-goat. In this chapter, the he-goat refers to Alexander the Great. It is recorded in history that when he marched into Macedonia, he wore a crown with a he-goat&rsquo;s horn. After a twelve year reign, he died suddenly before the age of thirty-three.</p><p>Daniel 8:8 says that &ldquo;the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones towards the four winds of heaven.&rdquo; The four generals under Alexander the Great carved up the empire, and each established his own kingdom. The Grecian Empire of Macedonia thus became four nations at the death of Alexander. Since these prophecies were written long before Alexander&rsquo;s time, in reading them one cannot but believe in the divine inspiration of the holy Scriptures.</p><p>Daniel 8:9 continues, &ldquo;And out of one of them came forth a little horn.&rdquo; This little horn refers to Antiochus Epiphanes, king of Syria, that is, the king of the north mentioned in Daniel 11:21-35.</p><p>Antiochus Epiphanes was the son of Antiochus the Great, king of Syria, and the younger brother of Seleucus Philopator. He was sent to Rome as a hostage when his father was defeated in the Battle of Magnesia. His older brother, unwilling to see his continuous detainment, exchanged him for his own son Demetrius. Upon his release, Epiphanes went on to Athens. When his brother was murdered by Heliodorus, Epiphanes, with the help of the king of Pergamum, killed Heliodorus and regained power. Since Epiphanes fought on his nephew&rsquo;s behalf, the throne should have been inherited by Demetrius. Yet instead of returning to Rome as a hostage and thereby relieving Demetrius to become king, he claimed the throne for himself. Hence, Daniel 11:21 says that he was a vile person, obtaining the kingdom by flatteries.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> </body></html>
