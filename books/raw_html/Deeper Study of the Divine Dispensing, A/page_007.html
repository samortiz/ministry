<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>THE BELIEVERS’ ENJOYMENT AND APPLICATION OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY AND ITS RESULTS</h1><h1 class="title">OUTLINE AND SCRIPTURE READING</h1><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The believers’ enjoyment and application of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Regenerated to receive God’s Spirit of life, begetting into the believers’ spirit that which is the life of Christ—John 3:3-6.<br><br>	John 3:3-6<br>	Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. (4) Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter the second time into his mother’s womb and be born, can he? (5) Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. (6) That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</li>	<li>Breathing the pneumatic Christ as breath—John 20:22.<br><br>	John 20:22<br>	And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</li>	<li>Drinking the pneumatic Christ as the living water—John 4:10, 14; 7:37-39.<br>	John 4:10<br>	Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that says to you, Give Me a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.<br><br>	John 4:14<br>	But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.<br><br>	John 7:37-39<br>	Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. (38) He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. (39) But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</li>	<li>Eating the Christ who is in the living word of life as the spiritual food—John 6:48, 57b-58a, 63.<br><br>	John 6:48<br>	I am the bread of life.<br><br>	John 6:57b-58a<br>	…so he who eats Me shall also live because of Me. (58a) This is the bread which came down out of heaven…<br><br>	John 6:63<br>	It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</li>	<li>Growing in the bountiful supply of Christ as the true vine—John 15:1, 4-5.<br><br>	John 15:1<br>	I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.<br><br>	John 15:4-5<br>	Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in Me. (5) I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.</li>	</ol></li><li>The results of the believers’ enjoyment and application of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Flowing the rivers of living water—John 7:38-39.<br><br>	John 7:38-39<br>	He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water. (39) But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</li>	<li>Bearing the fruits of life—John 15:5, 16a.<br><br>	John 15:5<br>	I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.<br><br>	John 15:16a<br>	You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit...</li>	<li>Feeding the lambs in the flock—John 21:15; 10:16.<br>	John 21:15<br>	Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs.<br><br>	John 10:16<br>	And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they shall hear My voice, and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</li>	<li>Becoming the bride of Christ, which is the Body of Christ as His increase—John 3:6b, 29-30.<br><br>	John 3:6b<br>	That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.<br><br>	John 3:29-30<br>	He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom’s voice. This joy of mine therefore is made full. (30) He must increase, but I must decrease.</li>	<li>Being the organism of the processed Triune God—John 15:1, 5, 8.<br><br>	John 15:1<br>	I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman.<br><br>	John 15:5<br>	I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing.<br><br>	John 15:8<br>	In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit, and you shall become My disciples.</li>	</ol></li></ol>
