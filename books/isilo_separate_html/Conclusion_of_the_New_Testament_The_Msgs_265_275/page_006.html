Christ</h2><p>In the previous message we saw that the Lord Jesus is the Son of David and the Son of Abraham. Now we must go on to see that He is also Christ. The title Christ is emphasized in Matthew 1:16 to prove that Jesus is the very Christ, the Messiah, prophesied in the Old Testament.<h2 class=head4>a. God&#8217;s Anointed-Messiah</h2><p>Concerning Jesus&#8217; being the Christ, John 1:41 says, &#8220;He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, We have found the Messiah (which translated means Christ).&#8221; Messiah is Hebrew; Christ is Greek. Christ is the anglicized form of the Greek word Christos. Both Messiah in Hebrew and Christos in Greek mean &#8220;the anointed One.&#8221; The term Messiah, the anointed One, is used in Daniel 9:26: &#8220;After the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing.&#8221; This refers to Jesus Christ, who is the anointed One. Christ is God&#8217;s Anointed, the One appointed by God to accomplish God&#8217;s purpose, His eternal plan.<h2 class=head4>b. For Us to Participate in His Kingship</h2><p>Jesus is the Christ for us to participate in His kingship (Rev. 20:4b, 6b). Our receiving the Lord Jesus as the King-Savior does not only bring us into the kingdom of God; it also brings us into the participation in Jesus&#8217; kingship. In other words, our receiving the King-Savior makes us part of the King. We, then, become His co-kings. Even today, all believers who walk in the divine way are kings, and the divine authority is with them. With such believers there is something special-the divine kingship. Therefore, we may experience and enjoy Christ as the One who brings us into the participation in His kingship.<h2 class=head3>4. Jehovah Our Savior</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is Jehovah our Savior. Matthew 1:21 says, &#8220;She will bear a son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for it is He who will save His people from their sins.&#8221; The name Jesus includes the name Jehovah. Jesus is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew name Joshua (Num. 13:16), which means &#8220;Jehovah the Savior,&#8221; or &#8220;the salvation of Jehovah.&#8221; Therefore, Jesus is not only a man but also Jehovah, and not only Jehovah but Jehovah becoming our Savior, our salvation.<h2 class=head4>a. Through Incarnation</h2><p>The Lord Jesus is God incarnate. It was through incarnation that He, Jehovah, became Jehovah our Savior. Jehovah means &#8220;I Am&#8221; (Exo. 3:14). Only God is the eternal One. From eternity past to eternity future, He is the I Am. Because the Lord Jesus is Jehovah incarnate, He could say of Himself, &#8220;Before Abraham came into being, I am&#8221; (John 8:58). Through incarnation Jehovah became our Savior.<h2 class=head4>b. To Save Us from Our Sins</h2><p>As Jehovah our Savior the Lord Jesus saves us from our sins. He saves us from our sin and sins, from all the besetting sins in our daily life, from the evil power of Satan, from everything God condemns, and from all negative things. Day by day we may experience, enjoy, and even express Christ as our Savior and as our salvation, saving us from every sin, both small and great. Whenever we call upon Him to save us, He is Jehovah our Savior, Jehovah our salvation.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
