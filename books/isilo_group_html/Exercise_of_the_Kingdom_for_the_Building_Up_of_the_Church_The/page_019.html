<p>Christ is our life and life supply for the purpose that we might express God. God cannot be expressed through man in an objective way. If He would remain in heaven and not get into us and be wrought into our being, He could not be expressed through us. God had to find a way to enter into us and to be wrought into us. Then our being will express not ourselves, but God. Therefore, the objective God, the God far away from us, has become the subjective God in our very being. He is not only within us, but is being wrought into us. Therefore, the Apostle Paul could say, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Paul did not say, &ldquo;For me to live is Saul of Tarsus, a learned Jew.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ,&rdquo; because the very God in Christ had been received by Paul and wrought into his being. Paul did not express himself, but Christ who had been wrought into him. This is God&rsquo;s purpose, and it is the reason He created us with a spirit and a soul.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, our soul is our being, our character, our person. As persons, we are not intended by God to express ourselves. Rather, God intends that we express Him. In our daily life and in our behavior we should not express ourselves, but God. In order to express God, we firstly need to exercise our spirit and take Him into us. Then we need to live the kind of life in our being, person, and character that expresses Him. Then people will say, &ldquo;This person does not express the American way of life; he expresses God.&rdquo; For us to receive God, we need a spirit; and for us to live Him out and express Him, we need a personality, which is our soul.</p>
<p>Some may think that those who are strong can express God, but that those who are not so strong cannot express Him. Others think that the intelligent ones can express God, but that the dull ones cannot. However, the dull often can express God better than the wise. I have known a number of intelligent believers who did not express God; instead, they expressed their cleverness. But I have also known some country people with very little education who truly expressed God because they lived by God and expressed Him through their personality.</p>
<p>We have seen that we have a spirit to receive God and a soul to live out God. Perhaps you are wondering what the function of our body is. Without a body we would be a phantom. As human beings, we need a tangible physical body. Having such a body, we are normal. Therefore, God created us with a spirit to take Him in, a soul to express Him, and a body to contain ourselves in a normal way. For His purpose, God had to create us with these three parts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S FIRST SIN</h2>
<p>In Genesis 1 we see God&rsquo;s creation, and in Genesis 2 we see clearly that God&rsquo;s intention in creating man was that man would receive Him as the tree of life. But in Genesis 3 the tempter came in to stir up the enjoyment of the soul, tempting Eve with the fruit that would make her like God. The aim of this temptation was to arouse the soul. When the soul is selfish, it becomes the self. It is altogether right to have a soul. But when the soul desires something for itself, it becomes selfish. The soul was created by God for the purpose of expressing Him, not to have its own enjoyment or preferences. Brother Nee put out a book entitled <em>The First Sin of Man.</em> Man&rsquo;s first sin was not adultery, stealing, or murder; it was taking something according to his own preference. To take fruit was not wrong, but to take fruit according to the preference of the soul was the activity of the self. Therefore, man&rsquo;s first sin was to do something for himself, to satisfy the self.</p>
<p>To repeat, the soul was made to express God. But when the soul does something to satisfy itself, it becomes selfish. This is the reason we must deny ourselves. To deny ourselves means to reject the soul&rsquo;s desire, preference, and choice. Whenever the soul wants something for itself, we must deny the soul. The desire of the soul for something for its own satisfaction was the cause of man&rsquo;s fall. By taking the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man fell, and his soul was ruined. The soul created by God for the purpose of expressing God had been ruined by the desire of the self. Because of this, the spirit was defiled and became deadened, having lost its function. Furthermore, the body entered into death. This is a complete picture of fallen man: the soul ruined, the spirit deadened, and the body subject to death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE SALVATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Because we are in such a fallen condition, we need God&rsquo;s salvation. Thank the Lord that He has come in to be our Savior. He put our nature on Himself and became the Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world (John 1:29). Through His redemption, our sins have been forgiven. Now God has a way to contact us and to bring us into His presence. We have been called, we have repented, we have believed in the Lord Jesus, we have been cleansed, and the Spirit of God has come into our spirit. Thus, we have been reborn, and our deadened spirit has been made alive. This is the salvation of the spirit.</p>
<p>Once we have received this salvation, we shall never lose it. This is proved by 1 Corinthians 5:5, a verse that speaks of a sinful brother. Although this one had been regenerated, he fell into a terrible sin. Therefore, Paul delivered him over to Satan that his flesh might be destroyed (probably through sickness), but that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. This indicates that once we receive salvation in our spirit, we cannot lose it.</p>
<p>The salvation of our soul, however, is a different matter. Our spirit has been saved in this age, and we cannot lose this salvation. But it is not yet determined whether or not our soul will be saved at the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Unlike the salvation of the spirit, the salvation of the soul is not a matter of simple faith. By confessing our sins, believing in the Lord Jesus, and calling on His name, we are regenerated and have salvation in our spirit. But the salvation of the soul requires a long process.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Exercise of the Kingdom for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
