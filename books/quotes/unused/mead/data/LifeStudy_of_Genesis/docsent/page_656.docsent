   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN JOSEPH'S DEALING WITH HIS BROTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message, another parenthesis in our life-study, we come back to the line of Joseph's personal life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I love the line of life even more than the line of Joseph as a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As I was contacting the Lord with a praying spirit, the Lord showed me the points in chapter forty-two regarding Joseph's personal life which we shall cover in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. JOSEPH NOT OUT OF CONTROL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IN SEEING HIS DREAMS FULFILLED</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Joseph must have been very happy to see the fulfillment of his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapter forty-two reveals that his brothers came to him and bowed down to him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Joseph was seventeen years old when he had his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the age of thirty he was exalted to rule over the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>About nine years later Joseph's brothers bowed themselves down to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that Joseph would have been probably thirty-nine years of age when his brothers came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, about twenty-two years after his dreams, Joseph saw them fulfilled, but not until he had been betrayed and imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then he spent many years in the dungeon and eventually was elevated to the throne at the time of his exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But still Joseph did not see the fulfillment of his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He had interpreted the dreams of his companions in prison and the dreams of Pharaoh, and the fulfillment of those dreams was a strong confirmation that his own dreams would be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, Joseph had to pass through a long period of testing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It may seem to us that his patience would have been exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Could you have waited twenty-two years for the fulfillment of your dreams?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Joseph did.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then on a certain day his brothers came and bowed down to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we had been Joseph, we would not have been able to contain our excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We would have jumped up and shouted, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Don't you know that I am Joseph?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How happy I am to see you!"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would have been beside ourselves with excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the sisters among us had been there, they would have first wept and then embraced all the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Joseph, however, was not out of control when he saw the fulfillment of his dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, he was calm and his excitement was under control.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was able to control himself in such a way because he was a person with the rulership of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you cannot control your own excitement, you cannot be a proper ruler.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ruling aspect of the mature life knows how to be calm, even in the most exciting situation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may say, "Didn't Joseph weep when he saw his brothers?"</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Yes, he did.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Joseph was a human being full of sentiment and normal feelings, not stone or wood.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, even in his weeping we see that he was a person who ruled himself.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Apart from Joseph, no one else could have controlled himself in such an exciting situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But he conducted himself outwardly as if nothing had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the ruling life, the victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Often it is necessary for us to hold back our excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Aaron's two sons were killed in the presence of God, Moses' words to Aaron implied that he should not weep, and immediately Aaron held back his tears Lev 10:1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many times we also must hold back our tears and place ourselves under the rulership of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A proverb says one who rules his spirit is better than one who takes a city Prov 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The fact that Joseph remained calm under the rulership of the Spirit proved that he was the one qualified to carry out such a vast administration.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even in the most exciting of circumstances, he was not touched by any excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the contrary, he remained calm, sober, and reasonable.</S>
