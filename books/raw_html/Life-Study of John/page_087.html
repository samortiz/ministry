<h2 class="head2">A. The Disciples&rsquo; Opinion</h2><p>In 11:8-16 we see the disciples&rsquo; opinion. When the news came about Lazarus&rsquo; sickness, the Lord&rsquo;s heart was not moved. The disciples must have been puzzled and perplexed. You can imagine how disappointed the disciples were. After two days, the Lord suddenly expressed the desire to see Lazarus. He said, &ldquo;Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep; but I am going that I may awaken him out of sleep&rdquo; (11:11). The disciples immediately said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover&rdquo; (11:12). Here we see the disciples&rsquo; human opinion. When the Lord did not want to go, they were puzzled, and when the Lord was about to go, they thought that it was not necessary to go. Once the Lord expressed His desire to go and see Lazarus, all of the disciples expressed their opinions. They told the Lord that it was dangerous to go because the Jews sought to stone Him (11:8). This is human opinion, which always contradicts the Lord&rsquo;s will. However, once the Lord made up His mind that He was going to see Lazarus, no one could change it. Eventually, the disciples agreed to go, but with a martyr&rsquo;s attitude fearing the Jews&rsquo; persecution, for one of them said, &ldquo;Let us also go, that we may die with Him&rdquo; (11:16). Many times in every local church the situation is exactly like this. There are plenty of opinions.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Martha&rsquo;s Opinion</h2><p>When the Lord came, Martha was the first one to meet Him (11:20). But before the Lord could say anything, Martha opened her mouth and gave forth another opinion: &ldquo;Lord, if You were here, my brother would not have died&rdquo; (11:21). She was complaining that the Lord had come too late. The Lord said to her, &ldquo;Your brother shall rise again&rdquo; (11:23). This means that the Lord would raise him immediately. However, Martha said, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day&rdquo; (11:24). Martha expounded this word of the Lord so as to postpone the present resurrection to the last day. What an expounding of the divine word! What devastating knowledge of fundamental teaching that frustrates people from enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s present resurrection life! Then the Lord Jesus said to her, &ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live; and every one who lives and believes in Me shall by no means die forever&rdquo; (11:25-26). The Lord seemed to be telling her, &ldquo;It is not a matter of time. There is no problem of time with Me. Nothing is too late, and nothing is too early. As long as I am here, everything will be all right, for I will raise up your brother.&rdquo; Then the Lord asked Martha, &ldquo;Do you believe this?&rdquo; Martha replied, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming into the world&rdquo; (11:27). What she answered absolutely was not what the Lord asked. She was not clear about what the Lord was saying. Her old, preoccupying knowledge prevented her from understanding the Lord&rsquo;s new word.</p><p>Martha is like many Christians today who have a great deal of knowledge and doctrine. Martha said, &ldquo;I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day.&rdquo; This sounds quite scriptural and correct. Then the Lord asked her if she believed that He would raise Lazarus up, and she said, &ldquo;I have believed that You are the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo; She believed in a certain kind of doctrine that the Lord is the Christ and the Son of God. She believed in the doctrine that the Lord will raise up all of the dead saints in the last day. She had all the knowledge, but it was not the living knowledge that the Lord taught. All of her different opinions were due to the fact that she had all the knowledge. Today, many Christians have opinions because they have so many teachings. When someone talks with them about the inner life, they immediately begin to share their opinions. Too much knowledge and too many doctrines breed endless opinions.</p><p>After Martha said that she believed the Lord to be the Christ, the Son of God, she went away and called her sister Mary. Martha said, &ldquo;The Teacher is here and is calling you&rdquo; (11:28). However, I cannot find a word saying that the Lord had called for Mary. That was Martha&rsquo;s suggestion. It was her self-assuming opinion. Again we see in Martha a person who was so full of her own opinions. She was so active in her opinion that she could never be silent. Perhaps you also love the Lord very much, but, like Martha, you cannot be silent.</p>
