<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Satanic Chaos with the Kings,<br>the Priests, the Prophets, and the People</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. David Falling into Sin,<br>and His Family Becoming a Mess</H2><P>David fell into sin, and his family became a mess (2 Sam. 11&#151;18). This was an issue of David's sins of murder and fornication. As a result of David's sins, his family did not have peace. Absalom, one of his sons, killed another of the sons and then rebelled against David and even sought to kill him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Solomon Falling into Sin<br>and His Kingdom Being Divided into Two</H2><P>Solomon fell into sin, and his kingdom was divided into two (1 Kings 11:1-40).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Decline of the Kings, the Corruption<br>of the Priests, the Falsehood of the Prophets,<br>and the Evils of the People of Israel<br>Being Intolerable</H2><P>The decline of the kings, the corruption of the priests, the falsehood of the prophets, and the evils of the people of Israel were intolerable. This chaotic situation is recorded in 1 and 2 Kings and in the books of the prophets.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Jerusalem Being Destroyed,<br>the Temple Being Burned,<br>and the People of Israel Being Captured<br>by the Babylonians</H2><P>Eventually, Jerusalem was destroyed, the temple was burned, and the people of Israel were captured by the Babylonians (2 Chron. 36:17-20). What chaos! This chaotic situation still continues with Israel today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. The Divine Economy<br>with the Returned Captives</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Captives Returning to Their Fathers' Land</H2><P>After seventy years of captivity, the captives were released and returned to their fathers' land (Ezra 1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Temple of God with the Altar<br>for the Offerings Being Rebuilt</H2><P>The temple of God with the altar for the offerings (typifying Christ) was rebuilt (Ezra 3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Returned Remnant of David<br>Bringing Forth Christ as Their Messiah<br>in His First Coming</H2><P>The returned remnant of David brought forth Christ as their Messiah in His first coming (Matt. 1:1, 6b-16; Luke 3:22-31). Through Joseph and Mary, descendants of the returned captives, Christ was born.</P>
