   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No doubt, the new covenant here is the new covenant spoken of in Jeremiah 31:31.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This new covenant is emphasized by Paul in Hebrews 8, where he quotes Jeremiah 31 in a very particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the entire Bible God made eight covenants with man, seven in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first was God's covenant with the created man Gen 2:8-9, 15-17 , and the second was His covenant with fallen man 3:8-21 .</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first covenant is called the covenant of law, and the second covenant is altogether wrapped up with God's divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The law is a portrait, a picture, of God, depicting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the law is not God Himself.</S>
