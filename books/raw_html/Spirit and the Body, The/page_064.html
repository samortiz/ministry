<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JOINT-HEIRS, JOINT-BODY, JOINT-PARTAKERS</H2><P>The Body is also a matter of being joint-partakers (Eph. 3:6, Gk.). According to the Greek, the word "heirs" in Ephesians 3:6 should be rendered "joint-heirs." The same Greek word appears before the words rendered "body" and "partakers." Hence, we are joint-heirs, a joint-body, and joint-partakers. If we would have the Body, we must learn the lesson that the Body is such a joint matter. The more we are joined to others, the better. Never be isolated, for isolation is against the principle of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE UNIQUENESS OF THE BODY AND THE SPIRIT</H2><P>We have seen that Ephesians 4:4 says, "one body, and one Spirit." This verse not only reveals the uniqueness of the Body; it also shows that the one Body is determined by the one Spirit. Because there is one Spirit, there is one Body. There is not another Body because there is not another Spirit. We must keep the oneness, the unique oneness of the Body, because the Body and the Spirit are unique.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BODY BUILT UP BY THE MEMBERS</H2><P>In Ephesians 4:11 and 16 we see that although the Body is produced by the transmission of Christ, it is built up by the gifted persons, by the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. However, the Body is not built directly by the gifted persons; rather, it is built directly by all the members of the Body. Therefore, Ephesians 4:16 says that every part has a measure of function and that the Body is built up by the function of every part in love.</P><P>If we put together all the points we have seen in this message, we shall have a general view of the Body. The Body is produced by the transmission of Christ. In order to have the Body in practical reality, all the ordinances must be abolished. Furthermore, we must recognize that the Body is a joint matter and that it is altogether in the Spirit. If we have the Spirit, we have the Body. Because there is one Spirit, we are limited to having one Body. We are compelled to keep the oneness of the Body. The Body is now being built up through the gifted persons who perfect the members to function so that the Body may be built directly through them.</P>
