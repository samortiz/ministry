   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4 Trial</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 12:9 13:18 we see Abraham's trial.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word trial is not a pleasant word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one likes to experience trials.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do you like to have trials in your life?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although no one likes trials, they are good experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Not too long after Abraham was called and began to live by faith, a trial came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not pray, "Lord, You are so good to me.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Don't let any trials come to me."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This kind of prayer will only hasten the coming of the trials.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord will answer your prayer in just the opposite way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you say, "Lord, don't send any trials," the Lord will say, "I will send a trial very quickly."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am assured that no one can say that since he was called by the Lord he has always enjoyed good times.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No one can say that.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our God is not only the God of love but also the God of sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our God is not only the God of love, the God of light, and the God of life, but also the God of sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everything is under His dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He manages the whole world just for us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must all believe that God manages the entire universe for every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may say, "How small I am!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How could the sovereign God manage the universe just for me?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But He does manage it just for you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You are not so small that God does not sovereignly arrange your environment for you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You are big enough to have God's sovereign arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have learned this from my own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Fifty years ago I did not like this story of Abraham going down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I simply could not be happy with that experience.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When, at that time, I read some messages on Abraham's downward experience, I did not understand it and did not feel good about it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I even questioned God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But now, after many years of experience, I am very happy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How we need to hear this message on Abraham's trial!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is easy to reach the high point in our experience with God, but it is not easy to remain there.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Look at the environment that surrounds you on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was sovereignly arranged before you were born.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although you may consider yourself a small creature, as far as God is concerned, you are a very important person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before the foundation of the world, God arranged everything for you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He even arranged that you would be reading this message right now.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are under God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not try to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you escape to a certain place, you will find that place to be the exact place that God arranged for you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When you reach old age, you will bow down and say, "Lord, I am fully convinced that You arranged everything for me before the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Abraham's trial was for him to learn a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all need to learn some lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We cannot learn these lessons from our parents or from the experienced brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all must learn some lessons of God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>a Famine</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we have seen, the second aspect of Abraham's experience was living by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He had to live by trusting in God for his daily needs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 12:10 we read that there was a grievous famine in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This famine was a test to see whether or not Abraham would trust in God in the matter of making a living, in the matter of his daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you examine 12:10-20, you will see that in this situation Abraham was weak and low.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He failed to keep the God-appointed position and went down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Behind Canaan was Babel, beside Canaan was Egypt, and close to Canaan was Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Abraham moved gradually southward until he went down to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As we shall see, in Egypt he sinned by lying.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Probably none of us would believe that Abraham could be so weak and low.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God had appeared to him at Ur, at Haran, and at Shechem.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At Shechem, God said to Abraham, "Unto thy seed will I give this land" 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God told Abraham definitely that He was going to give that place to his descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Who was the God that spoke to Abraham?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was the Creator, the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was the very God that appeared to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the famine came, Abraham should not have had any doubts but should have said, "I don't care about the famine because I have the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am not concerned about the lack of food because the One who called me, brought me here, and reappeared as a confirmation to my journey is the Almighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have put my trust in Him and now I am living by trusting in Him for my daily need.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I don't care whether there is food or not."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Abraham should have prayed in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, what did Abraham do when the famine came?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Did he pray?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Did he say to his wife, "Dear, let us pray"?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No, it seemed that Abraham forgot to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When such a period of testing came to him, he did not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not laugh at Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When everything is going well, you find it easy to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But when the famine comes, you forget that you are a Christian and only remember that you are a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You forget the living God who appeared to you, only remembering that you have a stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Abraham was concerned about his stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He looked at the situation: in the land there was famine, and in Egypt there was plenty of food.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Abraham and his wife did not talk very much.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Immediately they both agreed to go to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I believe that even before they made this decision, they were already going downward.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Both the husband and the wife forgot God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They did not consider where God wanted them to go.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It was as if they had no God.</S>
