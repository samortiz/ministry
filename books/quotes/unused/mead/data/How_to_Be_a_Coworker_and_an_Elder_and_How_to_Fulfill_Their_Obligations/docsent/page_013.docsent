   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To Be Begotten as God's Firstborn Son a. From Eternity Past without Beginning, Christ Was God's Only Begotten Son</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From eternity past without beginning, Christ was God's only begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As such, He possessed only divinity and was without humanity, because He had not yet become flesh to pass through death and enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Gospel of John the Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life" 11:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In eternity past He was already resurrection just as He was life, but He had not yet entered into the experience of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, you may be a professor but still lack the experience of being a professor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord is resurrection, and He has been resurrection from eternity past because He is God, who is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To be resurrected is to overcome and transcend death, that is, to enter into and come out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the only begotten Son of God, Christ is resurrection from eternity, but then He did not have the experience of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not until after He had accomplished His ministry in the flesh through His death that He entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Incarnation the Only Begotten Son of God Became Flesh to Be a God-man, a Man Possessing Both the Divine Nature and the Human Nature</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In His incarnation the only begotten Son of God became flesh to be a God-man, a man possessing both the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through Death and Resurrection Christ in the Flesh as the Seed of David Was Designated to Be the Firstborn Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Romans 1:3-4 tells us that through His death and resurrection Christ in the flesh as the seed of David was designated to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before His incarnation, Christ, the divine One, was already the Son of God John 1:18; Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>By incarnation He put on an element, the human flesh, which had nothing to do with divinity; that part of Him needed to be sanctified and uplifted by passing through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By resurrection His human nature was sanctified, uplifted, and transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, by resurrection He was designated the Son of God with His humanity Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His resurrection was His designation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the upcoming winter training, we will have a further crystallization-study of Romans to see something more concerning Christ's human nature and divine nature and how He was designated to be the firstborn Son of God.</S>
