   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SECOND TABERNACLE THE HOLY OF HOLIES,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SIGNIFYING THE NEW COVENANT AS A REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies that the new covenant is a reality, not a type vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>3-5, 7-8, 10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even during the old testament age, the Holy of Holies was not a type.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was a reality because God s shekinah glory, presence, and speaking were there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was there that God met with people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in the old testament age, not all the people could come into the Holy of Holies, because the way of entering into it had not been manifested yet.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Place was a type.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Were the lampstand and the table in the Holy Place real?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No, they both were pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But what about the shekinah glory and God s speaking in the Holy of Holies?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were realities.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the way into the Holy of Holies was not manifested in the old covenant age, it has been manifested today.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, we should no longer remain in the Holy Place; we must come forward into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we enter into the Holy of Holies, we are in the new covenant enjoying all the bequests of the new covenant, which has become a testament.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These bequests include God s presence, God s speaking, and God s meeting and having fellowship with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While we have fellowship with God, He infuses and transfuses Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the reality of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you realize that today we are here in the Holy of Holies?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you seen that we are now in the oracle enjoying God s presence?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah, we have crossed the river!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have left the Holy Place on the other side and we are now on the golden side in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. The Greater and More Perfect Tabernacle</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>the Better Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 11 says that Christ has come a High Priest of the good things that have come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The greater and more perfect tabernacle is the better covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Holy of Holies and the new covenant, which is the better covenant, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Not of This Creation, Not Made by Man s Hand</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, is not made by hand, that is, not of this creation v. 11 . It is made by God and is heavenly and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>C. A Reformation, the Reality of the Old Covenant,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Setting Things Right</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 10 speaks of the time of setting things right.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This phrase may also be rendered as reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the old testament age nothing was set right; nearly everything was upset.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The time of setting things right occurred when Christ came the first time to fulfill all the shadows of the old testament so that a new covenant might replace the old one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ has set everything in its right position.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The reality of the old covenant has set things right.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that there has been a right arrangement, a right ordering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, it is a reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is different from the restitution in Acts 3:21, which will occur at Christ s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ Having Come a High Priest</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>of the Good Things That Have Come</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The reformation depends upon Christ s first coming.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has come a High Priest of the good things that have come v. 11 . His first coming is mainly for Him to be the High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is through His priesthood, the kingly and divine priesthood which He is now exercising in the greater and more perfect tabernacle as a more excellent ministry, that all things are set right with life in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The good things that have come are the things ministered by the kingly and divine priesthood of Christ.</S>
