   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. His Brothers Giving Vent</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Their Anger</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In these chapters two gross sins are recorded.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter thirty-seven there is the sin of anger 37:18-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Joseph's brothers seized the opportunity to give full vent to their anger.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was not an insignificant case of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The one Joseph's brothers were plotting to kill was not a thief, but their own brother in the flesh, the dear son of their own father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If they had had any human affection at all, they would never have considered doing such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Reuben, however, did think of how it would affect their father; and Judah suggested that they not kill him, but sell him, which was far superior to shedding his blood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, in chapter thirty-seven we see the anger of Joseph's brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the next chapter, chapter thirty-eight, we have Judah's indulgence in lust, even in incest 38:15-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the fall of man, the first issue to come forth was the killing of a brother in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And the sin that brought in the flood as God's judgment upon the fallen race was the indulgence in lust.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These two sins, the sins of murdering a brother in the flesh and of indulging in lust, are repeated here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. Joseph Emerging from Anger,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Surviving in a Death Situation</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The anger of his brothers afforded Joseph the opportunity to live as a sheaf of life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While all his brothers were drowning in the water of anger, Joseph, the reigning aspect of the mature life, lived as a sheaf of life, emerging from the death water of human anger.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The record, under God's inspiration, uses fallen anger as the background to demonstrate how much life was in the sheaf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This sheaf was filled with life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When all the rest had sunk into the death water of human anger, this sheaf emerged and survived in that situation of death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is this not also the record of our life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Day after day, we are surrounded by the death water of human anger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But instead of drowning, we emerge out of the death water and survive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If this is a portrait of your daily life, then you are the reigning aspect of the victorious life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although, humanly speaking, we are prone to lose our temper, we nonetheless have the constitution of Christ that emerges out of the situation of anger.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, we are today's Josephs, sheaves of life rising up and standing up.</S>
