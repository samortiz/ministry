   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE MISUSE OF DEPUTY AUTHORITY AND GOD'S GOVERNMENTAL JUDGMENT Scripture Reading: Num 20:2-3, 7-13, 22-28; Deut 32:48-52 A DEPUTY AUTHORITY SHOULD SANCTIFY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Israelites wandered in the wilderness for over thirty years, we find in Numbers 20 that they forgot the lesson that they had learned through their rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When they came into the wilderness of Zin, they were without water, and they murmured and spoke against Moses and Aaron vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Moses and Aaron had learned many lessons before the Lord already.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But this time Moses erred in acting as God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to consider how God judges a deputy authority when he fails.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God was not angry this time at the people's murmuring; He told Moses to take the rod, which was a symbol of God's authority, and to speak to the rock so that it might yield its water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows that Moses and Aaron were God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God did not say that He wanted to punish the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moses and Aaron were not young men, yet they still failed in their position as God's deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 10 shows that Moses was very angry when he said, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring forth water for you out of this rock?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The phrase you rebels is strong in English as well as in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is a short expression in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moses used very strong words.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was angry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He might have thought, "This rebellious people has been causing trouble for decades, and they are causing trouble still."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He forgot God's command and struck the rock with the rod twice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although Moses was wrong, water flowed out just the same v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This act prompted God to rebuke His servant.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said, "You did not believe in Me, to sanctify Me in the eyes of the sons of Israel" v. 12a . This means that Moses and Aaron had not sanctified God; they had not separated God from themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Moses' speaking was wrong and his striking was also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His spirit was completely wrong, and he represented God in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In reading the Bible we have to touch the spirit of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It seems that God was saying, "I saw that My people were thirsty, and I gave them to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Why are you rebuking them?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God said that Moses and Aaron had not sanctified Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that they had not set Him apart as the holy One.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems that God was saying, "You have involved Me in your errors."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person's words have to do with his attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moses' word did not sanctify God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His attitude was different from God's attitude, and his feeling different from God's feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God did not rebuke the people, but Moses did.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This caused the Israelites to misunderstand God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They thought that God was fierce, that He was quick to condemn, and that He was a merciless God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is imperative that an authority represent God properly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether in wrath or in compassion, he should be like God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are wrong, we should confess that we are wrong; we should never drag God into our mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do, we will bring judgment upon ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a serious thing to drag God into our mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moses had been a deputy authority for decades, but he implicated God in his error.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He represented God wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why God had to judge him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a deputy authority makes a mistake and does not confess it, God will step forward to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It would be wrong for God to not judge Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's dealing with Moses and Aaron meant that this act was committed by Moses and Aaron only, and that God had no part in it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Israel's murmuring could have been a rebellion in attitude only; their spirit might have been different.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why God did not judge them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moses should not have judged them rashly when God had not judged them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He should not have uttered any unrestrained words according to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moses rebuked the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This was his own attitude and his own wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But this easily could have lead the Israelites to believe that this was God's attitude and God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Man's wrath does not accomplish the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is why God needed to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He had to separate Himself from Moses and Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He had to show the whole world that what Moses did that day was done by Moses alone; it was not done by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The words Moses spoke on that day were his own words; they were not God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can never implicate God in our mistakes or our personal failures, or give others the impression that our attitude is the attitude that God is expressing through His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do, God will have to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A deputy authority acts on behalf of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we become angry, we can only say that we are angry, that it is we who are behind it, not God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We have to separate the two.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>My worst fear is that man would become so bold as to associate his own acts with God's work, and think it unnecessary to identify his actions as his own.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are too prone to errors.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once we make a mistake, we should acknowledge it.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the one hand, this will save us from wrongly representing God and falling into the evil one's ensnarement.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the other hand, this will save us from falling into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we take the lead to acknowledge our mistakes, God will not have to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Otherwise, we will fall into God's governmental hand.</S>
