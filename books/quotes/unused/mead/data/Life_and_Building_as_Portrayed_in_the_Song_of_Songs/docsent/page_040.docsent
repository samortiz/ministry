   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANOTHER DISCREPANCY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now the seeking one has answered the Lord's call to come down to the valley to become a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But she is still not yet a city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In a sense, the garden is close to the city; yet when we consider the Bible, the garden is far removed from the city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The garden is at the beginning of the sixty-six books, and the city is at the end. She is now a garden, growing out the things she once enjoyed of the Lord; however, even in being a garden, some kind of discrepancy between her and the Lord still exists.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>5:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen the discrepancy between the Lord and the seeking one in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as we read the record in chapter five, it seems nearly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In chapter two, she was in the house and the Lord was outside the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now, the Lord is satisfied with her as a garden, and she is content and happy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She even declares that her outward man is dead, for she declares that she sleeps outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She has retired from all of her activities.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet inwardly she is awakened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She says, "I sleep, but my heart waketh."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This poetry indicates that while she is so content, she suddenly hears the voice of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that she realizes the Lord is not with her.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again she is inside, and the Lord is outside.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A DEEPER EXPERIENCE OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the reason for this discrepancy?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It seems that she did nothing wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She is now a garden for the Lord's enjoyment why is there still some discrepancy?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In our earlier years, we spent much time trying to understand this point.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not until 1935, when Brother Nee was going through this book with a few of us, that this point became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was then the Lord showed us that this was a deeper experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord said, "My head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What He means is that while the seeking one is content and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He is suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a picture in poetry depicts the suffering Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is also shown in this manner in Isaiah 53:3-4.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is really the man of sorrows.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Especially at the garden of Gethsemane, He was under the dew of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord's words to the seeking one reveal Himself as such a suffering one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is "a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>And now He is calling her to be such a suffering one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before the Lord became man, He was in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the time came for Him to be incarnated, and He put on our human nature as a kind of cloak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He became the "man of sorrows," and He was suffering under the dew of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now the seeking one is in the heavenlies, and the Lord calls her to come down out of the heavenlies to put on something to suffer for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But she tells the Lord, "I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, she is saying, "I have put off the old nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am in the heavenlies; therefore, how can I put it on again?"</S>
