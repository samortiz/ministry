   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT TRUSTING IN OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The only thing is this: when you take action, you should not do anything by trusting in yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Always hold the following prayerful attitude: "Lord, regardless of how much I've been working for You, without You I am nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I don't depend upon anything from the human side.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I only trust in You."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1963 I started to visit a group of saints in Las Vegas.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Eventually, they made the decision to sell their hall and move to Los Angeles to meet with the church there, although I never said anything to them about doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I simply went there to minister Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before I came to the United States, I did not dream that such things would happen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I did not dream that the Lord's recovery would spread from the United States to countries like Russia and Poland.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should not think that I can do something in the Lord but you cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All of you can do something in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You should just take action.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The result depends upon His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the years this has been my loving prayer: "Lord, I trust in Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I trust in Your blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I trust in Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I trust in Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I trust in Your Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I don't have any trust at all in myself, in anything else, or in anyone else."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all need to pray such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many of us have received much equipping in the years that we have been in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we remain simple and single toward the Lord and take action in Him, He can work through us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I would not have taken action to come to the United States thirty-two years ago, that would have been a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am saying this to encourage us all to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>CONTACTING PEOPLE AND SOWING THE SEED OF CHRIST INTO THEM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we take action, we should not forget that the main thing is to contact people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must have an interest in people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must love people and like to talk to people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether or not you know how to talk does not matter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You had better speak something you do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes I did this as a young person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>People thought I knew a lot, but actually I did not know that much.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when we speak, the Lord has a way to speak through us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not forget that you do not need to talk too much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Just say a few sentences concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must sow the seed of Christ through your contact.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This seed will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now is the time for you all to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The more that you do, the more you will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What I have received through the years was mostly gained by doing and learning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A WORD TO THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would like to say a word to the elders concerning the going on of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The elders should be those who shepherd the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They may be one hundred percent for the vital groups and yet not charge the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am concerned that they may not contact the individual sheep to find out how they are doing in the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The elders must do something to raise up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are not only the shepherds but also the "head sheep" at the head of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the head sheep would not take action, the whole flock will be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The elders do not need to rebuke others.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They just need to take care of the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every week they should contact a few saints for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such fellowship will stir up the saints to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The elders should take some action to supervise, but they may not like to oversee others to find out the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some of them may be afraid to do this for fear that the saints will be offended.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But I assure you that most of the saints want the elders to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Most of the saints love the elders and want to see them and fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A certain saint may not like the elders, but the elders should still try to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After two years, he may tell a particular elder, "Probably you don't know how much help you rendered to me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without your coming to visit me two years ago, I would not be here.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I might be out of the church life."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not do things according to our culture or constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should do things according to the need of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord needs a flock; the Lord needs the elders to shepherd the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Of course, I noticed that many of the elders are very careful not to offend the saints or make them unhappy.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is good.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if the parents are always so good to the children and do not correct them, the children will be spoiled.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am saying this to point out that eventually the perfected saints will be grateful to the elders who care for them properly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am burdened for both the elders and the rest of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The saints may think, "We are small; we have only one talent.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What can we do?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even if we do something, there will probably be no result, so it is better not to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is better to wait."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then the elders may think, "We need to be careful not to touch the saints too much.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we touch them too much, we will interfere with them, bother them, offend them, and lose them."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Thus, the elders do not feel free, because they have been bound by the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I am burdened that all the saints would rise up to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I am also burdened to see the elders rise up to supervise and shepherd the flock in order to help them go on in the way of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If all of us rise up to contact people every day, the Lord will really have a way to gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Just contact one or two people each day.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If you do not know how to speak, just speak.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If you speak, you will learn how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This training should usher in your action.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There is no reason or excuse that you would not take action to contact people.</S>
