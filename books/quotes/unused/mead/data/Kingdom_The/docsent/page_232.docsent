   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE KINGDOM IN HEBREWS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What a wonderful book Hebrews is!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It reveals that Christ is superior to every item of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a Christ is eventually the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hebrews is a book concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we prove that Hebrews is a book related to the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us read Hebrews 1:8: "But as to the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse says, "as to the Son, Your throne" and "Your kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It does not say Your redemption, Your salvation, Your love, or Your power.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fact that it says "Your throne" and "Your kingdom" indicates the matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us also read Hebrews 12:28: "Wherefore, receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly with godly fear and awe."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Does it say we are receiving salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Or redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Or peace?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It says we are receiving a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the pure Word of the Lord, Hebrews is not merely a book on salvation, but on the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the kingdom?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The kingdom is the maturity of Christ as life to us, and it is the ultimate consummation of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hebrews is a book on the enjoyment of Christ, and this enjoyment will consummate in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>SUPERIOR TO THE ANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hebrews surely shows that Christ is much better than all of the items of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What are the main items of Judaism?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First were the angels, through whom the law was given; next were the leaders such as Moses and Joshua; next were the priests such as Aaron; and last was the Old Testament, the Old Covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, the writer of Hebrews compared Christ with all of these items, showing that Christ was superior to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the first two chapters Christ is compared with the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is much higher and much superior to the angels because He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He created all things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He tasted death for us, and He destroyed Satan and the authority of death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord Jesus accomplished everything for us, was glorified, and is crowned in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Presently, He is working to impart Himself into us to make us His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the Son of God, and He is making us also into sons of God as His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now He is bringing us into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did everything for us He suffered, He delivered, He saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is such a wonderful One!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How about the angels?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The angels are simply ministering spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They cannot compare with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is such a wonderful One, and He is our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our salvation is not a "thing," but a wonderful Person!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Oh, how great a salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The writer was short of words to describe this great salvation, so he simply used the word so!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How great a salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is impossible to describe how great.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the writer says that if we neglect so great a salvation, we will surely suffer something Heb 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Have you realized that the book of Hebrews was not written to unbelievers, but to the Hebrew believers?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>All of them were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But there was a problem they were distracted from the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They were saved, and they had begun to participate in Christ, but they were in the dangerous position of being distracted away from Christ back to Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If this were to happen, they would lose the enjoyment of Christ in the fullest way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that they would neglect so great a salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they were distracted from Christ and should neglect so great a salvation, they would suffer a kind of punishment from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we neglect so great a salvation, how can we escape some kind of punishment?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do not think, though, that this means we can lose our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our salvation is for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once we have been saved, we can never be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hebrews even calls our salvation "eternal salvation" Heb 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But after we have been saved, we need to go on to enjoy Christ more and more until the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is not a matter of being saved or lost.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is a matter of more and higher enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we neglect the enjoyment of so great a salvation, we will suffer some loss.</S>
