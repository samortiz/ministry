[1]  In this chapter there are a number of specific things that I wish to discuss with you.
[2]  If I were to stand before you, although I may not be moving, you could see that my nose, mouth, and face all bear a living expression.
[3]  The day before yesterday, I attended a morning watch in Hall One, where all the ones there were elderly brothers.
[4]  But when those brothers began to read, To be watchful is just to check yourself, to see whether or not you are in spirit right now, or Prayer is to bring yourself into the spirit, keeping yourself in spirit and staying in the spirit, or The most difficult time for us brothers to remain in spirit is when we speak to our wives.
[5]  The second thing I want to fellowship with you is that there are different kinds of speaking.
[6]  In the past, when we came to the big meetings, as soon as the leading brothers arrived, our mouths were sealed.
[7]  Do not think that since we are now free in the home meetings, we can talk about anything and everything.
[8]  No matter what age we are, we must pay attention to this one thing: if we want to speak in the meetings we must be well acquainted with the Bible in our daily life.
[9]  Every time we come to meet, we are meeting around the Lord s Word, contacting the Word and getting help from the Lord.
[10]  When you help people to read the footnotes and the Life-study messages, you must be careful.
[11]  Do not give others the impression that you are a leader or a core member.
[12]  CHAPTER TWO A THREE-IN-ONE LIVING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:1, 3, 24, 31-32; 12:7-8; Gen 20:7; Neh 8:9; 2 Sam 12:1
[13]  It seems as if all of us have nothing else to do besides hurrying to meetings, busily going to meetings, and attending meetings.
[14]  Actually, it is not that we have nothing else to do.
[15]  Rather, we are those who have been called by the Lord Jesus out of all our busy engagements to meet together.
[16]  Although I do not know much about music, and although I do not have a good voice or an ear for music, I do love to sing.
[17]  These dear brothers and sisters are not only reluctant to speak; they simply cannot understand what this Brother Lee has been doing.
[18]  If you are under a powerful speaking ministry which ministers the Lord s word to you, and you are being moved and edified, your experience tells you that even to say a small Amen from your heart will make a big difference.
[19]  But if you come to a home meeting with eight brothers sitting in a brother s living room, it would be impossible for you not to speak.
[20]  When your love towards the Lord is fresh, when you have such a sweet fellowship with Him in the morning, you wish that the evening would come sooner so that you may go to the meeting.
[21]  EXERCISING ALL THE TIME TO SAY O LORD, AMEN
[22]  Whether young or old, all of us must exercise to do one thing: from the time we wake up in the morning until we go to bed at night, as long as we are awake and breathing, we must set our minds on the Lord.
[23]  Perhaps you would say, I want to do this.
[24]  I admit that sometimes I forget the Lord also.
[25]  But one thing which I have learned makes it hard for me to forget the Lord: I always call on the Lord.
[26]  If you would call O Lord all the time, you will be reminded of Him.
[27]  I have learned a secret: no matter how busy I am, I would learn always to say O Lord, Amen.
[28]  When you go to the home meeting, you must go with a spirit of prayer.
[29]  Whether anyone arrives before you at the meeting, and regardless of how many people there are in the meeting, as soon as you arrive, you should begin to pray.
[30]  I have told you before that the home meetings should not have any leader.
[31]  Now I would add that there should not even be any so-called core members.
[32]  Constantly we maintain a fellowship with the Lord and always exercise ourselves to say O Lord, Amen.
[33]  CHAPTER THREE WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4; Eph 5:18-19; 1 Thes 5:16-19
[34]  In this chapter we will continue to speak concerning the key points on the home meetings.
[35]  I want to have some fellowship with you based on my experience and observation.
[36]  If we are burdened for the home meetings, the first thing we must take care of is that which is recorded in Romans 8:4.
[37]  But I wish to tell you that although my scholarship cannot be compared with yours, I have one thing that you do not have.
[38]  If we walk according to the Spirit, our spirit will be filled with God.
[39]  This is what Ephesians 5:18-19 refers to: Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.
[40]  Once we are filled with God in spirit, we will spontaneously sing psalms, hymns, and songs with our heart, speaking to one another and praising the Lord.
[41]  While I take a walk, I sing one hymn after another:
[42]  Now let me ask you a question: If I were to say, I am about to get angry, what hymn do you think I should sing?
[43]  But we are only asking you to attend three important meetings in a week: the Lord s Day morning truth meeting, the evening table meeting, and one home meeting.
[44]  CHAPTER FOUR EXERCISING TO SPEAK THE LORD S WORD Scripture Reading: Eph 3:16-17; 2 Cor 3:16-18 LEARNING TO SING AT HOME
[45]  The hymn we just sang, hymn 987, was written at the beginning of this century.
[46]  At that time, the liberal theology was flourishing, which said that the Bible is not the word of God, that miracles are not real, and that the resurrection of Jesus was merely a resurrection of His ideas.
[47]  I hope you brothers and sisters would all pick up the burden that from now on, whenever you have some free time at home, you would sing these hymns until you know them well.
[48]  All of you young people who have studied away from home do know that when you come home for vacation, the one thing that your mothers love most to do is to sit you down and feed you the food they have prepared for you.
[49]  We all need to have a proper concept of the meetings.
[50]  We do not come to the meeting to worship ; we come to the meeting to enjoy.
[51]  When we read the Old Testament, in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy we do see numerous instances where God told the Israelites that their center of worship was to be Mount Zion in Jerusalem.
[52]  I said yesterday that if you come to the home meetings, it proves that you love the Lord.
[53]  If you have not thoroughly prayed before the Lord for three weeks, even though you may have been busy attending meetings, pursuing the truth, working on the campus, and doing all kinds of spiritual works, you will not sense that Christ is making His home in you.
[54]  At those times my greatest hope is that the meeting time would come quickly; I have a strong appetite for the meeting.
[55]  When we all behold the Lord with unveiled face, that is, when we behold Him face to face, we reflect the Lord and are transformed into His glorious image, from glory to glory.
[56]  If we allow the Lord to make His home in our hearts, and are willing to have our veils taken away, we will have an unveiled face to behold Him and will be transformed into His image.
[57]  As you fellowship with the Lord this way, you may say to the Lord, No cordial like gladness my strength can restore, for joy is the fountain of healing.
[58]  If in your daily life you let the Lord make home in you, and if you are being transformed into His image by beholding His glory with unveiled face, then He will lead you.
[59]  Brothers and sisters, you need to see that the key to the home meetings is that we live in the Lord in our daily life.
[60]  When we come to the meeting, I bring the Lord I have enjoyed, you bring the Lord you have enjoyed, he brings the Lord he has enjoyed.
[61]  CHAPTER FIVE EVERYONE BRINGING IN PEOPLE Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:8; John 1:40, 42; Acts 10:42; 16:31; John 5:2, 4, 5, 8-16; 4:39-42; 21:15-17; Acts 11:25-26; 1 Thes 5:14; James 5:19-20
[62]  I have a Savior, He s pleading in glory,
[63]  For you I am praying, for you I am praying,
[64]  Let us go on to see a key to the home meetings.
[65]  Today we want to bring out one key to the home meetings, that is, to bring others to our meetings.
[66]  If we desire to see our home meetings prosper, everyone must bring others to the meetings.
[67]  If you would do this, and he would do this, soon the number in the home meetings would increase.
[68]  Her word to the Lord was, Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock?
[69]  If you do not bear fruit, you are doing something other than the Lord s destiny for you, and you will lose the enjoyment of the Lord.
[70]  John chapter one shows us that after Andrew met the Lord, immediately he found his own brother and said to him, We have found the Messiah v. 41 . He then led him to see Jesus.
[71]  When Philip met the Lord, he went and found Nathanael, and said to him, We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and prophets, wrote v. 45 . Nathanael had more knowledge than Philip did.
[72]  Every lover of the Lord must be like paste; he must be able to be spread anywhere.
[73]  There are still many relatives and intimate friends whom we must try our best to bring in. Acts 1:8 says, But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
[74]  SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 3:15-16, 2, 9; 2 Tim 2:2, 15; Rev 1:2, 9
[75]  In the home meeting, when we say that we want everyone to speak, we mean that everyone should speak God s word.
[76]  I am giving you all these examples to show you that within the last fifteen years the Lord has moved on tremendously all over the world.
[77]  Through the home meetings, the brothers and sisters will all receive nourishment from the Lord s word, and the word of the Lord will spread everywhere.
[78]  Starting from December 15, every Lord s Day morning we will be divided into classes for our truth lessons.
[79]  Then on the Lord s Day evening, after the Lord s table meeting we will reserve half an hour for fellowship concerning a message on life.
[80]  By the time the weekend comes, when we come to the home meetings, we will have prepared another message for fellowship.
[81]  Then when you go to visit people one-on-one, you will have at least one or two spiritual messages with which to supply them.
[82]  When we love the Lord, fellowship with Him, walk according to the Spirit, and are filled in spirit, we will speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and we will sing and praise with our hearts to the Lord.
