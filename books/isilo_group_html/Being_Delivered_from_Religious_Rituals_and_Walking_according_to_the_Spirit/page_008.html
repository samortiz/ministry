ACCORDING TO THE LETTER OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Let us now consider three examples in the Gospel of John that show how knowing just the Bible can cause us to miss Christ. The first example is in John 1. After Philip met the Lord, he went and told his friend Nathanael, saying, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth&rdquo; (v. 45). Nathanael replied, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (v. 46). Nathanael seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Christ is from Nazareth? I know what the Bible says. Christ should come from Bethlehem.&rdquo; People who have mere mental knowledge of the Bible run the risk of missing Christ. We cannot say that their knowledge is right, nor can we say that their knowledge is wrong. Was the Lord Jesus the son of Joseph? The answer is both yes and no. Did the Lord Jesus come from Nazareth? The answer is both yes and no. The Lord Jesus is not simple.</p>
<p>A person cannot know Christ merely according to the Bible. The Bible says that Christ would be born in Bethlehem. This means that He comes from Bethlehem. This being the case, how could He be from Nazareth? This reasoning is logical and correct; however, this way of reasoning will cause a person to miss Christ. We often miss Christ because we know too many doctrines. Philip did not reason with Nathanael; he simply said, &ldquo;Come and see&rdquo; (v. 46). By going to see, Nathanael met the Lord and was caught by the Lord (vv. 47-49). Therefore, instead of arguing with people concerning doctrine, we should lead them to Christ.</p>
<p>The second example is in chapter 7. The Lord Jesus went up to Jerusalem for the Feast of Tabernacles and did many miracles. On the last day of the feast, He cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (v. 37). Some of the people who heard this said, &ldquo;This is truly the Prophet,&rdquo; and others said, &ldquo;This is the Christ.&rdquo; However, some said, &ldquo;Does then the Christ come out of Galilee? Has not the Scripture said that the Christ comes out of the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?&rdquo; (vv. 40-42). In this portion of the Scriptures, people missed Christ because of their knowledge of the Bible. They knew the Bible, but their Bible knowledge caused them to miss Christ.</p>
<p>The third example is also in chapter 7. There arose a division among the crowd because of the Lord Jesus (v. 43). The Pharisees reprimanded their attendants because they did not seize the Lord Jesus. Nicodemus, who had gone to see the Lord Jesus previously, spoke on behalf of the Lord, but the Pharisees rebuked him in anger, saying, &ldquo;Are you also from Galilee? Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee&rdquo; (vv. 45-52). It is true that no prophet had ever arisen out of Galilee. However, out of Galilee arose the greatest Prophet.</p>
<p>Nathanael nearly missed Christ because of his knowledge of the Bible. The Jewish religionists missed Christ because of their knowledge of the Bible, and the Pharisees also missed Christ for the same reason. There may still be Nathanaels, religionists, and Pharisees today, but may we not be Pharisees or religionists! We need to be Nathanaels who go to see the Lord. We should not care for our Bible knowledge; rather, we should care only for contacting the living Lord, the living Spirit. May the Lord have mercy on us and deliver us from religion, doctrines, and Bible knowledge so that we may live in the light and in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We must pray for ourselves, for others, and for the church not to miss Christ. We desire that every saint in the church would be a Joseph or at least a Nathanael.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Being Delivered from Religious Rituals and Walking according to the Spirit &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
