They are apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers. The goal of these gifts is "for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry." These five kinds of gifts are for the purpose of perfecting the saints to participate in their ministries. The ministries of the believers are miscellaneous in nature, whereas the five gifts are specific&mdash; they are for the purpose of helping the believers fulfill their ministries. These gifts are the ministries for the believers' ministries. They are like the bank of the banks, or the central bank. Every bank conducts its own business. In addition, the central bank helps to facilitate transactions between various banks. These five ministries are also like the teachers of a teachers' college. Their goal is to produce teachers. Hence, they can be called the teachers of the teachers.</p><p>The job of the various ministries is to perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry. Hence, they are the ministries of ministries. Those who help others in this way should have at least one of these five gifts, or they can have all five gifts. If a man does not have any of these five gifts, he cannot have a part in these ministries of ministries because he cannot perfect others into their ministries. Of course, an ordinary believer can do the work of these five gifts even when he does not have God's calling. The result of his work is the same in nature as the work of those who have the calling for such ministries.</p><p>Matthew 25 tells us that the Lord distributed talents to the slaves. Some had five talents, some had two talents, and some had one talent. Every slave had at least one talent. According to the distribution of these talents, we can conclude that some slaves signify those who have ordinary gifts while other slaves signify those who have particular gifts. Those who received one talent received ordinary gifts, whereas those who received two or five talents received special gifts. "Prophecy" and "teaching" in Romans 12:6 and 7 refer to the gifts of prophets and teachers in Ephesians 4:11. The gift of apostleship in Ephesians 4 does not just refer to those who have physically seen the Lord face to face.</p><h2 class="head2">The Joints of Supply</h2><p>All the gifts in the church which do not belong to the five kinds spoken of in Ephesians 4 should submit themselves to these gifts. In this way, no one will be puffed up or become proud through his own gift. Ephesians 4:13 says, "Until we all arrive." This proves that the work of the preceding five ministries has been going on continuously. This work will go on until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith, at the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. It will go on until we are all joined to the Head, Christ. This means we still have apostles today. The condition in Ephesians 4:13-15 proves that the five gifts are still available and still exist. Verse 16 speaks of "every joint of the rich supply." Man's physiological organs can be divided into two categories. The first category is the consuming organs which consume energy, such as hands and legs. The second category is the supplying organs, such as the mouth, the ears, and the eyes; they receive things from outside the body. The five gifts mentioned above are joints of supply. Before the Lord, we must seek to supply other members. When others are supplied, we also receive the benefit. But if we are not one of these gifts, we will have nothing with which to supply others. In that case, it is better that we receive the supply from the gifted ones.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_068.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_070.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 41: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (1) &nbsp; pg 69</div><br></body></html>
