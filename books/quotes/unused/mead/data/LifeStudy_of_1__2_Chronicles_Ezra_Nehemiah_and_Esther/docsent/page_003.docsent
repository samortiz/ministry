   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TIME</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first book covers about 41 years, from 1056 to 1015 B.C., not including the forefathers genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second book covers about 479 years, from 1015 to 536 B.C.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These two books might have been written in Jerusalem after Ezra s coming back from the captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>V. THE CONTENT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The books of 1 and 2 Chronicles cover the genealogy of mankind from Adam to Abraham and the genealogy of God s elect from Abraham to the family of Saul, and the history of Israel from Saul the king to Israel s return from their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this we see that 1 and 2 Chronicles cover three kinds of history: the history from Adam to Abraham, which concerns the whole world; the history from Abraham to Saul, which concerns the forefathers of the race of Israel, before they were formed into a nation; and the history of the kingdom of Israel, from the time of Saul to the coming back from their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE CENTRAL THOUGHT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The matter of the central thought of 1 and 2 Chronicles is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A. To Give a Full Chronology</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of God s Move in Man s History</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The central thought is, first, to give us a full chronology of God s move in man s history by including the genealogy from Adam to Samuel, indicating that God s move in man s history to prepare the way for God to carry out His eternal economy in humanity by becoming a man that man may become God is not a matter that concerns only the history of God s elect but a matter that concerns the history of the entire race of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The central point of view in 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings is the chosen people of God, but in 1 and 2 Chronicles it is the entire race of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This needs a lineage not from Samuel but from Adam to Christ, which corresponds to the genealogy of Christ as recorded in Luke 3, not as presented in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The view in Matthew 1 is narrow and is limited to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The view in Luke 3 is broad and includes all of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a strong evidence that the coming Christ as the embodiment of God is not only for the one race chosen by God but for the entire human race created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to see that God s move is in man s history.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Have you ever heard such a phrase as God s move in man s history ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you believe that in today s tumultuous world situation God is still moving in man s history?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to believe that God has been moving and is still moving in and through man s history.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Adam s history God moved, and in Abel s history God also moved.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was a move on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But God moved even in Cain s history.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was a move on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can testify from my observation of the world situation since 1918 and from my study of the prophecies in the Bible that God surely moves in man s history.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us consider, for example, the dispute over Palestine, that is, over the good land, that has been going on for hundreds of years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Who is the landlord, the rightful owner, of the good land Israel or the Arabs?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Jews say that Palestine is the land of their forefathers, and the Arabs claim that it is the land of their forefathers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This issue has not been settled but is still on the negotiating table.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The statesmen involved in these negotiations are foolish men, for they do not know God or the Word of God, the Bible, yet they are talking about God s affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is the landlord of Palestine, and only He can solve the problem concerning this land.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I believe that while the statesmen are negotiating over the ownership of the good land, the Lord is in the heavens laughing Psa 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The decision regarding the good land will not be made by statesmen; it will be made by the One who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Soon the Lord Jesus may come back and settle this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When He comes He may say to the statesmen of the world, This is not your business it is My business.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have pointed out that the chronology in 1 and 2 Chronicles indicates that God s move in man s history is to prepare the way for God to carry out His eternal economy in humanity by becoming a man that man may become God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If this cannot be accomplished, there is no way to solve the problems of today s world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the problems on this earth are waiting for one thing for a good number of men to become God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This matter concerns not only the history of God s elect, Israel, but also the history of the entire race of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The world situation has changed greatly during the past fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In these fifty years God has blended together people from everywhere on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In our semi-annual trainings saints come together from fifty nations.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This would have been impossible fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This blending of the nations is something that could have been accomplished only by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through such a blending thousands of God-men will be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Russia, for instance, the God-men are spreading and increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The whole world is open to the ministry in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This ministry has reached to all six continents, and I have received letters of appreciation from saints in many different countries saying that they are open to receive this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Recently I released the matter of the high peak of God s revelation the revelation that God became a man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead for the producing of the Body of Christ as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now we need to pray that the Lord will give us a new revival, a revival which has never been seen in man s history.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such a revival will be something new, for it is related to God s hobby, to His good pleasure, to the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God s good pleasure is that God would become a man to make man God in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the desire of God s heart, the hobby in His heart, and He will accomplish it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As we have seen, whereas the central point of view in 1 and 2 Samuel and in 1 and 2 Kings is the chosen race of God, the central point of view in 1 and 2 Chronicles is the entire race of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This indicates that God thinks not only about Israel but also about the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Most of us are not of the people of Israel, but God thought about us in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Ephesians 1:4 tells us we all were chosen by God before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We praise the Lord for choosing us in Christ before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>B. To Present Some Important Details</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>of God s Dealing with the Kings of Judah</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The central thought of 1 and 2 Chronicles is also to present to us some of the important details of God s dealing with the kings of Judah that are not recorded in 1 and 2 Samuel and in 1 and 2 Kings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many readers of the Bible feel that 1 and 2 Chronicles are somewhat repetitious, covering things which have been covered already in 1 and 2 Samuel and in 1 and 2 Kings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We need to see that at the beginning of 1 Chronicles a part of mankind s history is recorded that is recorded neither in 1 and 2 Samuel nor in 1 and 2 Kings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Furthermore, at the end of 1 Chronicles there is a supplement to David s history, and in 2 Chronicles there is a supplement to the history of the kings of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Israel was divided into two nations: the northern kingdom, called the kingdom of Israel, and the southern kingdom, called the kingdom of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The good kings were not in Israel but in Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Second Chronicles does not touch the kings of Israel but covers only the kings of Judah, giving us details not found elsewhere concerning God s dealing with them and also telling us the reasons why God dealt with them in the way He did.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>C. To Give a Complete History</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>of God s Move in Man s History</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Finally, in 1 and 2 Chronicles we have a complete history of God s move in man s history from Adam to Abraham, from Abraham to Samuel, and from Samuel, who brought in the kingship, to Israel s return from their captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>THE SECTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>OF THE COVERAGE OF THE PRESENT STUDY</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this life-study we will not cover all of 1 and 2 Chronicles but only certain parts of these books.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Mainly we will cover those parts of 1 and 2 Chronicles that are a supplement to the history in 1 and 2 Kings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The matters covered in the life-study of 1 and 2 Samuel and in the life-study of 1 and 2 Kings will not be repeated here.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The sections of the coverage of our present study include the genealogy from Adam to the twelve tribes of Israel 1 Chron 1 9 ; the supplement to the history of David 1 Chron 22:2 29:30 ; and the supplement to the history of the kings of Judah 2 Chron 11:5-23; 13:1-21; 14:6 15:15; 17:1-19; 19:1 20:30; 21:12-18; 24:14b-24; 25:5-16; 26:6-21a; 28:8-15; 29:3 32:8; 33:11-17; 34:3-7; 36:20b-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, this study will cover three things: the genealogy of mankind, the supplement to the history of David, and the supplement to the history of the kings of Judah.</S>
