[3]  The four major works of Watchman Nee in the 1920s are The Christian Life and Warfare, The Christian magazine, The Spiritual Man, and The Present Testimony magazine.
[4]  In addition to these, we have collected some of Watchman Nee's miscellaneous works during the early stage of his ministry in this present volume.
[5]  Chapters one, two, three, and four are of a deeper nature and are for Christians.
[6]  CHAPTER ONE THE WORD OF THE CROSS I. DYING WITH THE LORD TO SIN
[7]  When the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for the sinners, opening a living way for sinners to obtain eternal life and to come to God, He also died with the sinners on the cross.
[8]  If the effectiveness of the cross were merely in the aspect of substitution so that sinners would have eternal life and be saved from perdition, God's way of salvation would not be complete.
[9]  This is because a person who is saved by believing in Jesus Christ Acts 16:31 still lives in this world; there are still many temptations.
[10]  Moreover, the devil often cheats him, and the sinful nature within him operates continually.
[11]  Therefore, in His salvation the Lord Jesus had to accomplish both aspects: to save man from the punishment of sin and also to save man from the power of sin.
[12]  When the Lord Jesus died with the sinners on the cross, He delivered man from the power of sin the old man is dead, and man is no longer a slave of sin.
[13]  We do not die by ourselves; rather, we die together with the Lord.
[14]  We were baptized "into His death" Rom 6:3 ; "we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death" v. 5 ; "we have died with Christ" v. 8 ; and "our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves" v. 6 . We cannot crucify ourselves and die.
[15]  The death of the Lord Jesus is a fact; that the Lord Jesus died for us is also a fact, and our being crucified together with Him is also a fact.
[16]  "Has been crucified," according to the original, is a continuous word; it is in the absolute perfect tense, which means that our old man's crucifixion with the Lord Jesus is an act that was accomplished once for all when the Lord died.
[17]  To reckon yourself dead to sin is to reckon yourself already crucified.
[18]  It is to reckon that your old man has already been crucified and that the cross of the Lord Jesus was also the cross for your old man; it is to reckon that the death of the Lord Jesus is the death of your old man and to reckon that the time the Lord Jesus died nineteen hundred years ago is the time your old man died.
[19]  The old man has already been crucified on the cross with Christ.
[20]  If we reckon in our heart the things we believe in, God will accomplish the same things.
[21]  This being the case, how we need to be watchful and on the alert so that the old man will never have a day to rise up again!
[22]  Therefore, in order for the cross to work in the believers, they must have the empowering of the Holy Spirit.
[23]  The cross and the Holy Spirit can never be separated.
[24]  The cross makes it possible for the believers to overcome sin; the Holy Spirit makes real in the believers' lives what the cross has accomplished.
[25]  In our experience, death to self is deeper and more advanced than death to sin.
[26]  Usually God's children pay much attention to overcoming sins.
[27]  They know very well how that after they sin, their regenerated life grieves over the evil and bitterness of sin.
[28]  Therefore, after they have received the light and have realized how to die with the Lord and how to reckon themselves dead to sin, they rely on the power of the Holy Spirit and begin to seriously reckon themselves dead and to allow the victory of the cross to be expressed in their heart and through their body.
[29]  Because believers are unaware of the source of self and do not realize that it can produce that which both God and man condemn as evil as well as that which is recognized by man as good, they remain in the realm of the "self" and fail to enter into the enjoyment of the full and rich life of God.
[30]  The self is our personality and everything contained in our personality.
[31]  Out of the self grow our personal opinion, taste, thought, longing, bias, love, and hatred.
[32]  The self-life is the power by which one lives.
[33]  We must keep in mind that the self is just ourself plus our likes and dislikes.
[34]  Its life is the natural power by which we perform good and do work.
[35]  The self is a life, because it lives in the believers whose self has not been removed.
[36]  We should come before God to rebuke our self and offer up everything to Him.
[37]  By the Spirit of the Lord, we should put to death everything that is included in our self-life.
[38]  We should tell God, "Hereafter, it is no longer I, no longer my own likeness, opinions, tastes, or preconceptions.
[39]  Starting from today, I will live only according to Your will.
[40]  The self includes the will, the emotions, the intelligence, etc. This does not mean that when we believe in our self being crucified with Christ, our will, emotions, intellect, etc., will be annulled! No one can annihilate the few faculties which make up his being just by believing in his having been crucified with the Lord! To die with the Lord simply means to no longer allow the self to be the master, to no longer act according to one's own will, emotions, and thoughts, and to no longer allow the self-life to have its way; it means to allow the Lord's Spirit to rule over everything that the self encompasses so that the person can obey God's life within.
[41]  Our common thought is that we are very willing to give our bad, filthy, sinful, and satanic things over to Christ and have them nailed on the cross with Him.
[42]  We are very willing to get rid of the evil things in the self.
[43]  However, our frequent problem is that we think we should keep the good things of the self.
[44]  In the sight of God, the self is totally corrupted and deeply affected by the fall of Adam.
[45]  According to God, He cannot heal the life of the self, nor can He remedy it.
[46]  There is no other way but to crucify it with Christ on the cross.
[47]  If we are truly willing to die, and if we truly die, we will lose many praises of man.
[48]  Formerly, we might have had the intelligence to come up with many new reasonings and theories.
[49]  When the self dies, we will have to wait for the Lord's direction and leading and will not dare to depend upon our own intelligence anymore.
[50]  Formerly, we might have had love and could have loved many.
[51]  When the self dies, we will have to let the Lord's love love through us, and we will have to allow the Holy Spirit to permeate our heart with the Lord's love.
[52]  Formerly, we might have had emotions and could be joyful, angry, sad, and happy at will; we could fellowship with the Lord through our feelings and could sense His joy.
[53]  Recently many people seem to be tired of hearing the word of the cross.
[54]  However, we thank and praise God the Father that He has reserved for His own great name many faithful ones who have not bent their knees to Baal.
[55]  Still, I feel that there is one thing the faithful servants of Christ should know.
[56]  Why, after they have done so much preaching of the cross, have the results been so discouraging, and people have not had much change in their lives after hearing the true Word of God?
[57]  We who labor for the Lord should understand why we cannot gain others by the gospel we preach.
[58]  I hope that we would pray quietly before the Lord and ask the Spirit of God to enlighten our hearts that we may know where our failure lies.
[59]  The message Paul preached was the Lord Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[60]  If we forget the cross and do not make the cross and Christ our unique subject, how much will we and our audience miss!
[61]  I believe that we are surely not those who do not preach the cross.
[62]  Those who are not crucified cannot be and are not worthy to preach the message of the cross.
[63]  The cross which we preach should crucify us first.
[64]  The message we preach should burn in our life first so that our life and our message can be mingled together.
[65]  In this way our life will become our living message.
[66]  If we do not have the experience of crucifixion in our life, if we do not have the experience of dying together with the Lord in overcoming sin and self, if we do not have the experience of bearing the cross and following the Lord to suffer for Him, and if we only know the word of the cross from others' speaking and writings but have no experience of it ourselves, we surely cannot give life to others.
[67]  We have said that our work is to dispense life to others.
[68]  However, we ourselves do not have the life to give to others, to enliven others, and to nourish others.
[69]  The life of God flows through us and flows out from within us.
[70]  The word of the cross is doing the dredging work, removing all that belongs to Adam and the natural man, so that we can receive the life of the Holy Spirit and be saturated with the Holy Spirit.
[71]  In this way, our spirit will constantly bear the cross of the Lord to the extent that our life becomes the life of the cross.
[72]  If we truly allow the cross to do a deep work in us, to the extent that we become filled with the Holy Spirit, we will spontaneously flow out life to nourish those whom we touch whenever we speak or preach in public or to individuals.
[73]  After we read 2 Corinthians 4 please read it , we will realize the inner experience of this servant of the Lord.
[74]  The secret of all his work was "death operates in us, but life in you" v. 12 . He passed through death daily.
[75]  Every day he allowed the cross to do a deeper work in his heart so that others could gain life.
[76]  If one does not have the death of the cross in himself, others cannot gain the life of the cross.
[77]  We know that Paul not only preached the cross as a crucified person, but he preached the cross in the spirit of the cross.
[78]  In his daily life he was a crucified person; in his preaching he was also a crucified person.
[79]  Paul was a person who was crucified with Christ.
[80]  When he announced the cross, he did not exercise his "excellence of speech or wisdom," or "persuasive words of wisdom" 1 Cor 2:1, 4 which he was good at.
[81]  Because he preached the Savior of the cross with the way of the cross, he had the demonstration of the Spirit and of power v. 4 . We ought to be able to say with Paul that "our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance" 1 Thes 1:5 . If the Spirit and His power are not working behind our speaking, our words are useless even if they are enticing.
[82]  Herein lies the key to the difference between fruitfulness and fruitlessness in an evangelist.
[83]  Sometimes, we see two evangelists having the same utterance and expressions.
[84]  The other may be spiritual and scriptural in his speaking, and his audience may also pay much attention to him, but nothing results from his speaking; there is no fruit.
[85]  It is not difficult to discover the reason behind this difference.
[86]  What we lack is the deep work of the cross in us, which results in the Holy Spirit working with us in our gospel preaching and in His life flowing out through us.
[87]  We have mentioned earlier the matter of our natural abilities.
[88]  Some people are more intelligent; they are naturally sharper than others.
[89]  Some people are very eloquent; when they speak, their arguments are always very reasonable.
[90]  Some people are very analytical; they can analyze a problem logically.
[91]  We know that God does use man's natural abilities, but man often takes occasion in God's use of his abilities to trust in all his natural abilities.
[92]  In our practice, every time and anywhere the Lord burdens us to testify for Him, we should drive away afresh any desire that is in us to rely upon our natural abilities.
[93]  We should set aside our emotions and pay no attention to our own feelings.
[94]  Even at times when we have no feelings at all, or when our emotions are as cold as ice, we need to kneel down before the Lord and ask Him to do a deeper work of the cross in us so that we can be able to direct our emotions and can act according to the Lord's command, regardless of whether our emotions are cold or hot.
[95]  We can ask the Lord to strengthen our spirit and apply a fatal blow to our soul on the cross.
[96]  If we do this, the Lord will be gracious to us and will defeat our cold emotions.
[97]  Even though we already know what we are going to preach, we do not try to dig out such teachings from our head or our mind.
[98]  Rather, we humble ourselves before God and ask Him to freshly enlighten us with the teachings that we have known before and to freshly impress such teachings upon our spirits so that what we preach does not become merely a recollection of our old experience but a fresh encounter in our life.
[99]  It is best for us to spend a long time before the Lord prior to our preaching to allow His word some of which we have been familiar with for a long time already to be impressed upon our spirit afresh.
[100]  Satan does not like our preaching of the cross at all.
[101]  When we are faithful in speaking about the cross of the Lord, he surely will raise up many oppositions.
[102]  He can frequently initiate the following attacks against the messengers of the cross.
[103]  Satan attacks the messengers of the cross by causing them to be ill or to lose their voice in the course of giving a message.
[104]  Many believers do not grow in their spiritual life because they do not know how to walk in God's will.
[105]  This appears to be God's will, and that also appears to be God's will.
[106]  God's will has been fully declared in the Bible.
[107]  All those who seek to know His will can find His intention concerning any matter through searching the Scriptures.
[108]  Many believers in the church today depend solely on supernatural visions as a guide for their conduct.
[109]  They tell others about their encounters with Jesus and what the Lord has said to them.
[110]  They dream about heaven on certain days, and they tell others what the Lord has revealed to them concerning their future and what they should do.
[111]  Some believers are used to making decisions on their own.
[112]  Seeking after the Lord's will in everything and acting accordingly is like putting a bridle in the horse's mouth for them; it is not easy for them to be subdued.
[113]  Sometimes they reluctantly seek after the Lord's will, but before the Lord tells them anything, they charge ahead anyway.
[114]  Once I asked a Christian, "How do you know that this is the Lord's will?"
[115]  He answered, "Because I have prayed over it."
[116]  An architect must have a blueprint to lay down the specifications of a building he is about to build.
[117]  The size, height, and dimensions must first be drawn out in detail.
[118]  Only then can he carry out his plan according to his design.
[119]  Most modern buildings are designed in this way before they are built.
[120]  In knowing God's will, the most important thing for us to do is to drop our opinions.
[121]  Our prejudice often hinders God from revealing His will to us.
[122]  When a man is prejudiced, God will not reveal His will to him.
[123]  Our own experience indicates that our self-will keeps us from understanding God's will.
[124]  Sometimes, our self-will is hidden in the innermost part of our heart.
[125]  If we do not remove our own will, we will encounter many difficulties in understanding His will.
[126]  Once it is removed, God will reveal to us His will.
[127]  We must not consider or follow only one of these three ways.
[128]  If we only consider one way, it will be easy for us to fall into Satan's snare.
[129]  If we consider the three ways together, we will not fall into error.
[130]  Dr. Meyer said, "When we see the Holy Spirit, the Bible, and the environment line up in a straight line, we know that we are walking in God's will." Indeed, when all three things testify that we are standing on the right ground, we know that we are walking according to God's will.
[131]  We have covered some conditions related to the prompting of the Holy Spirit.
[132]  Now for the sake of the weakness of God's children, we will say a few more words.
[133]  This means that when we are about to do something, God will give us the assurance that what we are about to do is according to His will.
[134]  This kind of assurance comes in a calm way.
[135]  When He gives us this assurance, He will put a calm peace in our heart and refresh our heart.
[136]  If there is faith to maintain it, we will see this assurance always abiding; it will not change through time and place, and we will not doubt if this is God's will.
[137]  After a child of God thinks that something is the prompting of the Holy Spirit, for the sake of safety, he should verify what he is about to do with the biblical teaching.
[138]  Biblical teaching does not refer to isolated verses in the Bible taken out of their context.
[139]  Many believers act in a haphazard way; they read one or two verses and consider them to be God's ordained will for them.
[140]  If they unfortunately find some contrary indications, or if verses they read have nothing to do with their affairs, they think that God has not said anything to them, or they unnaturally interpret the passage to make it fit into their situation.
[141]  The environment is often the best instrument for the manifestation of God's will.
[142]  This does not refer to man's reactions of approval or disapproval.
[143]  Before we are clear about God's will, it is best that we not do what we are not clear about.
[144]  We should absolutely wait before God until we are clear, and then act accordingly.
[145]  Sometimes God sees that we will profit if He delays revealing His will to us.
[146]  At such times, we should adopt the attitude that we will not do what we do not know.
[147]  Therefore, before we are clear, and when things are "too high" for us, we should not do anything lest we regret it later.
[148]  In seeking to know God's will, we have to be honest and practice what we know.
[149]  It is for the sake of practicing God's will that we seek it.
[150]  If we have no intention of practicing, what good does it do if we know His will?
[151]  If we do not put to death the deeds of the flesh and do not walk according to God's will, our life will suffer a great blow.
[152]  God wants us to do His will; He is not satisfied with us only knowing His will.
[153]  The question covered in this book is a very important one.
[154]  He was seen by human eyes Luke 24:34 ; He was touchable v. 39 ; He could eat food v. 43 . The Lord Jesus Christ has now ascended into heaven v. 51; Acts 1:9-11 . If heaven is not a place, how can Jesus Christ physically reside there? If we say that the Lord Jesus Christ ascended into heaven with a body, it must mean that heaven is a place.
[155]  The location of heaven mentioned in the Bible is above.
[156]  When the people built the tower of Babel, God said, "Let us go down" Gen 11:7 .
[157]  My intention here is not to interpret the meaning of these few verses, but to mention the points related to the question being studied, i.e., where is heaven.
[158]  This Lucifer, son of the dawn who fell from heaven, is Satan.
[159]  If we compare this passage with Luke 10:18, Revelation 12:7-12, and 1 Timothy 3:6, we can see that this one is Satan.
[160]  However, regardless of who he is, in these verses there is a clear and accurate mention of where heaven is.
[161]  He was proud, desirous to rob the position of God and to be like the Most High.
[162]  Psalms 48:2 also mentions "in the uttermost parts of the north" according to the original text .
[163]  "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, / is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, / the city of the great King."
[164]  It seems this Mount Zion, the city of the great King, refers to the earthly Jerusalem because it is "the joy of the whole earth."
[165]  The earthly Jerusalem is not in the uttermost parts of the north.
[166]  Therefore, this mount should at least imply "Mount Zion...the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem" Heb 12:22 .
[167]  Psalms 75:1 says, "Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, / unto thee do we give thanks: / for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare."
[168]  The teaching of a universal fatherhood, that is, the teaching that says everyone in the world is a child of God, is one of the many important questions in these days.
[169]  If all the people in the world are God's children, then they do not have to repent, they do not have to confess their sins, and there is no need to receive the Lord Jesus as Savior.
[170]  However, if this is not the case, then the gracious gospel revealed in the Bible becomes necessary.
[171]  Hence, we are willing to look into what God in His Bible has taught us concerning this matter.
[172]  May God open our eyes that we will not be deceived by the philosophy of this world.
[173]  At present, there is a very popular and modernistic teaching which says that God is the Father of all mankind and that all people in the world are brothers and children of God.
[174]  The Bible has shown us four aspects of sonship in which the people of the world have no part.
[175]  Just by looking at these four aspects of the doctrine of sonship, we can see that the people of the world are different and that not all people are sons of God.
[176]  His being the Son of God is very special and unique; He has something different from the other sons of God.
[177]  When Paul was preaching in Athens, he said that God "made from one every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, determining beforehand their appointed seasons and the boundaries of their dwelling, that they might seek God, if perhaps they might grope for Him and find Him, even though He is not far from each one of us; for in Him we live and move and are, as even some poets among you have said, For we are also His race.
[178]  We can read the Word of God again and consider at the present time whose sons the men of the world are.
[179]  The Israelites said to Christ, "We have one Father, God" John 8:41 .
[180]  "If God were your Father you would love Me....You are of your father the devil,...for he is a liar and the father of it" vv.
[181]  Our Lord clearly referred to the Israelites as the sons of the devil because they followed the desires of the devil v. 44 . If the chosen Israelites are not sons of God but rather sons of the devil, then the rest of the world, even more, are sons of the devil.
[182]  ...Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God.
[183]  Therefore come out from their midst and be separated, says the Lord, and do not touch what is unclean; and I will welcome you'; and I will be a Father to you, and you will be sons and daughters to Me, says the Lord Almighty'" 2 Cor 6:14-18 .
[184]  "That you may be blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as luminaries in the world, holding forth the word of life" Phil 2:15-16 .
[185]  The only begotten Son of God, the Lord Jesus, is without blemish.
[186]  Although there is a generation that is crooked and perverted outwardly, we are the children of God without blemish inwardly.
[187]  Those who are children should be like their fathers; likewise, the children of God must also be the same in nature as their heavenly Father.
[188]  The "children of God" is not only a title, a privilege, or a relationship, but a life from heaven, because "the Father...brought us forth by the word of truth" James 1:17-18 in order that we might "become partakers of the divine nature" 2 Pet 1:4 .
[189]  "In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest" v. 10 . Those who live in sin habitually and do not have the power of deliverance are not born of God but belong to the devil.
[190]  Since not all who are in the world are the children of God, and since the children of God are as described above, the most important question is how can one become a child of God?
[191]  Before we can become sons, we must first be born.
[192]  Before we become the sons of God, we must be born of God.
[193]  Whoever sees the danger of being a child of Satan and the calamities that are to come, and desires to become a son of God, does not need to do anything; all he needs to do is believe in the testimony of God concerning His Son, Jesus Christ, to trust in Him wholeheartedly, to obey Him, to accept Him as Savior by faith, to believe in the effectiveness of the salvation which He accomplished on the cross, and by faith to offer Jesus Christ up as the sinner's sin offering.
[194]  "Beloved, now we are children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we will be.
[195]  We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is" 1 John 3:2 .
[196]  Although the future has not yet been manifested, nevertheless, do not the two words "like Him" include everything?
[197]  In this age of modern science, it seems that everything must be questioned before it can be believed.
[198]  Of course, this is very meaningless because the condition for obtaining truth is not skepticism, but impartiality and the lack of prejudice.
[199]  The higher criticism is formulated by those who do not believe in the revelation of God.
[200]  Since its founders hold this view, can a Christian follow these teachings?
[201]  Christianity has only one book that reveals the Christian concept concerning God.
[202]  When we were sinners, how did we know that believing in the Lord Jesus' vicarious death on the cross for us would result in our salvation?
[203]  Some men with equal or higher intelligence than these critics have pointed out the unreliability of their arguments.
[204]  Modern scholarship has gradually overturned the authority of higher criticism.
[205]  Many of the higher critics are unable to answer the challenges of books written by their opponents.
[206]  A recently published book Is Higher Criticism Reasonable? was written by Dr. Wilson who came to China two years ago 1923 . The higher critics have not been able to answer the challenges made in his book.
[207]  The knowledge of one critic or the knowledge of all the critics combined are not enough to overturn the authenticity of the Bible!
[208]  The higher critics are only a disguised form of the devil who said, "Yea, hath God said?"

[215]  LESSON ONE EXCUSES FOR NOT RECEIVING CHRIST Not being able to understand: "But a soulish man does not receive" 1 Cor 2:14 "Perishing...blinded the thoughts" 2 Cor 4:3-4 "To do His will" John 7:17 First believe then understand Rom 3:11; Prov 3:5; Hosea 6:3; Psa 25:14 Fear of not being able to stand firm unto the end: "I will help you" Isa 41:10, 13 "Able to guard you" Jude 24 "By no means perish" John 10:28 "Guarded by the power of God" 1 Pet 1:5 See also Heb 13:5; 2 Tim 1:12; 2 Cor 12:9; Phil 1:6 The conduct of many believers is very corrupt: "Will give an account concerning himself to God" Rom 14:10, 12 "Do not judge" Matt 7:1-2 "Who are you"?
[216]  James 4:12 "For you who judge practice the same things" Rom 2:1 Hindered by business affairs: "They are requiring your soul from you" Luke 12:20-21 "The love of money" 1 Tim 6:9-10 "Forfeit his soul-life" Mark 8:36 "Treasures on the earth" Matt 6:19; Eccl.

[218]  LESSON TWO THE TRUTH OF CHRIST'S SALVATION The state of man without Christ: "Lost" Luke 19:10 "Perish" John 3:16 "Condemned already" John 3:18 "Their works were evil" John 3:19 "Hates the light" John 3:20 "The wrath of God" John 3:36 "Your father the devil" John 8:44 "From within...proceed evil" Mark 7:21-23 The death of Christ is needed to save man: "My blood...poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" Matt 26:27-28 "To give His life as a ransom" Matt 20:28 "I lay down My life for the sheep" John 10:11, 15 "Lifted up" John 3:14-15 .
[219]  The perfect redemption of Christ: "It is finished!"
[220]  John 19:30 "One sacrifice for sins" Heb 10:12 "Bore up our sins in His body" 1 Pet 2:24 The condition to be saved by Christ: "Your faith" Luke 7:50 "Your faith" Luke 8:48 "Believes" Mark 9:23 "Every one who believes" John 3:16 "Believes...disobeys" John 3:36 "Believes" John 5:24 The perfectness of the promises of Christ: "By no means perish forever" John 10:28 "Able to guard" 2 Tim 1:12 "Complete it" Phil 1:6 The perfect work of Christ's intercession: "Holy Father, keep" John 17:11 "To save to the uttermost" Heb 7:25 "If anyone sins, we have an Advocate" 1 John 2:1 Man receives the nature of God through regeneration: "Begotten of God" John 1:12-13 "Christ our life" Col 3:4 "Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20 "I live, you also shall live" John 14:19
[221]  LESSON THREE GOD'S MESSAGES You are a sinner: "There is no man that sinneth not" 1 Kings 8:46 "There is none who does good" Psa 14:1 "All have sinned" Rom 3:23 Your nature is corrupt: "In sin...conceive" Psa 51:5 "The heart is deceitful" Jer 17:9 "In me...nothing good dwells" Rom 7:18 "Enmity against God" Rom 8:7 God loves you: "God so loved the world that..."
[222]  John 3:16 "While we were yet sinners" Rom 5:8 "The love of God was manifested among us" 1 John 4:9 "He loved us..."
[223]  1 John 4:10 Christ died for your sins: "Takes away the sin of the world" John 1:29 "Christ died for our sins" 1 Cor 15:3 "Bore up our sins" 1 Pet 2:24 You who believe in Christ shall be saved: "Has eternal life" John 3:36 "Has eternal life" John 6:47 "Everyone who believes is justified" Acts 13:39 "Shall be saved" Acts 16:31 Christ gives you great promises: "Receive you to Myself" John 14:3 "He may be with you forever" John 14:16 "Ask and you shall receive" John 16:24 "Neither by any means shall I abandon you" Heb 13:5 "Confess his name" Rev 3:5 Unbelievers shall be condemned: "Shall be condemned" Mark 16:16 "Condemned already" John 3:18 "Die in your sins" John 8:24 "Wrath and fury.
[224]  Tribulation and anguish" Rom 2:8-9 "Their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone" Rev 21:8
[225]  LESSON FOUR A GREAT COMPARISON Acts 28:24 Some were persuaded Acts 28:24a Those who believe are born again: "Regenerated" 1 Pet 1:23 "Begotten...of God" John 1:13 Those who believe have redemption: "Redeemed us out" Gal 3:13 "We have redemption" Eph 1:7 Those who believe have become near to God: "Become near" Eph 2:13 "Before Him" Eph 1:4 Those who believe are made sons of God: "Sons of God" Gal 3:26 "Children of God" 1 John 3:2 Those who believe have the love of God: "God commends His own love to us" Rom 5:8 "He loved us" 1 John 4:10 Those who believe wait for Christ and glory: "Christ...will appear...to those who eagerly await Him" Heb 9:28 "You will receive the unfading crown of glory" 1 Pet 5:4 Those who believe are guaranteed to go to heaven: "An inheritance...kept in the heavens" 1 Pet 1:4 "Into His heavenly kingdom" 2 Tim 4:18 Those who believe have passed out of death into life: "Has passed out of death into life" John 5:24 Some did not believe Acts 28:24b Those who do not believe are born in sin: "Shapen in iniquity" Psa 51:5 "Born of the flesh" John 3:6 Those who do not believe are cursed: "Under a curse" Gal 3:10 "Fall under the judgment of God" Rom 3:19 Those who do not believe are far from God: "Far off" Eph 2:12-13 "Separation between you and your God" Isa 59:2 Those who do not believe are the children of Satan: "Of your father the devil" John 8:44 "Children of the devil" 1 John 3:10 Those who do not believe have the wrath of God: "Wrath of God abides upon him" John 3:36 "The coming wrath" Matt 3:7 Those who do not believe wait for death and judgment: "Die once, and after this comes judgment" Heb 9:27 "In the day of judgment" Matt 12:36 Those who do not believe are guaranteed to go to the lake of fire: "Their part will be in the lake which burns with fire" Rev 21:8 "Cast them into the furnace of fire" Matt 13:41-42 Those who do not believe have "been condemned already" John 3:18 .
[226]  LESSON FIVE WHAT TO SAY TO LOST ONES All have sinned: "There is none righteous" Rom 3:10, 23 "Stumbles in one point" James 2:10 "Like sheep have gone astray" Isa 53:6 "Incurable" Jer 17:9 See also Gal 3:10; Ezek.
[227]  18:4 "Eternal fire" and "eternal punishment" Matt 25:41, 46 "Being in torment" Luke 16:23 See also Psa 9:17; 11:6; Rev 20:15; 21:8; 14:11 Christ died for our sins: "Bore up our sins" 1 Pet 2:24 "Suffered once for sins" 1 Pet 3:18 "Died for the ungodly" Rom 5:6 "Propitiation" 1 John 4:10; Rom 5:8; Isa 53:5; Gal 3:13; 1 Cor 15:3; Heb 1:3 Salvation is prepared for all men: "Every one" John 3:16 "That which is lost" Luke 19:10 "Not intending that any perish" 2 Pet 3:9 "Him who comes to Me" John 6:37; 1 Tim 1:15; 2:4; Rev 22:17; Isa 1:18; Mark 2:17 Saved through faith: "Believes" John 3:16 "Received...believe" John 1:12 "Believes" John 3:18 "Believes" Acts 13:39 See also John 3:36; 5:24; 6:47; 20:31; Acts 10:43 There is only one way to be saved by grace: "For neither is there another name under heaven given" Acts 4:12 "Not out of works in righteousness" Titus 3:5 "For the grace of God, bringing salvation to all men, has appeared" Titus 2:11 "The gift of God" Eph 2:5, 8 See also Rom 4:4-5; 11:6; Gal 2:21; 2 Tim 1:9 Confessing Christ before men is joyous: "Saved" Rom 10:9-10 "I also will confess in him before My Father" Matt 10:32 "Sing unto the Lord" Psa 96:2
[228]  LESSON SIX WHAT SHALL I DO TO BE SAVED?
[229]  The position of man and his end before God depends upon whether he receives or rejects the works which His Son, Jesus Christ, accomplished on the cross.
[230]  If he lives in unbelief until his death, he is hopeless and eternal condemnation is guaranteed.
[231]  There is no need to ask if he will perish when he dies.
[232]  If a man has not received the blood shed by God's Son, Jesus Christ, for the covering of his sins, he is "condemned already" John 3:18 .
[233]  An unbeliever is under the wrath of God: "The wrath of God abides upon him" John 3:36 "Having no hope" Eph 2:12 "Blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers" 2 Cor 4:3-4 "Will die in your sins" John 8:24 "Shall be condemned" Mark 16:16 "In flaming fire...vengeance" 2 Thes 1:7-8 "Lake which burns with fire and brimstone" Rev 21:8 Saved by believing in the heart:
[234]  Believing merely in a historical Christ is neither having the faith which saves by believing in the heart, nor the receiving of Christ, the believing of the testimony that God gave concerning His Son.
[235]  "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness" Heb 9:22 .
[236]  The only passport to salvation is the blood of the Lamb of God.
[237]  Only this blood can protect man from the wrath which is to come.
[238]  LESSON EIGHT THE PROBLEM OF SIN What is sin?
[239]  Sin is A transgression, an offense against God, a serious shortcoming, a violation Webster's Dictionary.
[240]  "Sin is lawlessness" 1 John 3:4 "Not out of faith is sin" Rom 14:23 Who is the originator of sin?
[241]  9:18 "Sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death" James 1:15 "The wages of sin is death" Rom 6:23 The sin of the unbelievers: "Will render an account...in the day of judgment" Matt 12:36 "Thou...canst not look on iniquity" Hab 1:13 "After this comes judgment" Heb 9:27 "Die in your sins" John 8:24 "Sins...follow after" 1 Tim 5:24 "Him to whom we are to give our account" Heb 4:13 The sins of the believers: Where were they?
[242]  Unbelievers have two errors: They think that 1 Christians are bound, and 2 unbelievers are free.
[243]  But God says that unbelievers are under bondage and that believers are free!
[244]  The love of God not only cuts off and purges the root and stem of sins in the hearts of evil men, it also changes sinners from being cursed to being blessed, from being morally corrupted to being capable of every good deed, from being servants of Satan to being messengers of God, from being people of darkness to being children of light, and from being those who indulge in their lusts to being servants who obey Christ.
[245]  "As You have loved Me" John 17:23 Breadth "every one who" John 3:15-16 Length "eternal" Jer 31:3 Depth "for me" Gal 2:20 Height "in the heavenlies" Eph 2:4, 6 Whom does God love?
[246]  "Freely" Hosea 14:4 As the Father John 16:27 "To the uttermost" John 13:1 What did God's love do for us?
[247]  "A propitiation for our sins" 1 John 4:10 "Has released us from our sins" Rev 1:5 "Saved us" Titus 3:4-5 "Would not perish, but would have eternal life" John 3:16 "Raised...seated us together" Eph 2:4-6 "Eternal comfort and good hope" 2 Thes 2:16 What will God's love do for us?
[248]  LESSON ELEVEN THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION How are we saved?
[249]  "Grace...faith" Eph 2:8-9 "Believe on the Lord Jesus" Acts 16:31 "Not out of works in righteousness" Titus 3:5 When are we saved?
[250]  The Bible teaches us that being saved is a present matter.
[251]  Every Christian feels that he has two natures, but not every Christian knows the reason why.
[252]  Because he does not know how to deal with this kind of experience, much sorrow and discouragement may fill his heart.
[253]  The nature that is born of the flesh has no goodness at all; but the nature that is born of God does not commit sins.
[254]  The source and nature of the new man and the old man are opposites.
[255]  BETWEEN LAW AND GRACE Deuteronomy 21:18-21; Luke 15:21-32 Law: What is the law?
[256]  "Holy" Rom 7:12 "Perfect...faithful" Psa 19:7 "Right...clear" Psa 19:8 What does the law say?
[257]  From the law, man cannot receive any help at all: "Guilty of all" James 2:10 "Fall under the judgment of God" Rom 3:19 The law cannot accomplish anything: "Not able to be justified" Acts 13:39 "Perfected nothing" Heb 7:18-19 Why did God give the law?
[258]  A person can be very polite, moral, strict, and conscientious and yet be very far away from the holiness of God.
[259]  He can endeavor to work, with sweat on his face, and can offer offerings to God like Cain.
[260]  He can read the Bible, pray, and listen to sermons and yet, at the same time, be waiting for death and judgment!
[261]  Believe in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son 1 John 5:10-12 "Believe in your heart" Rom 10:9-10 Abraham believed in God's word Gen 15:6 Abraham believed God's speaking Gal 3:5-6 "Having heard the word...believing" Eph 1:13; Rom 10:13, 17 What can faith do?
[262]  "Repay each man according to his doings" Matt 16:27 "Receive the inheritance as recompense" Col 3:22-24 "My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is" Rev 22:12 Works that are without faith: Fleshly and worldly Of the self Inward and downward Leading to darkness and hardship According to man's wavering condition Faith: Of God and of heaven Based on Christ's accomplished work Outward and upward Leading to light and peace According to God's unchanging truth
[263]  When a lost person receives Jesus, he freely obtains an eternal and perfect salvation.
[264]  His sins are forgiven, righteousness is imputed to him, and the records of his sins are forever erased.
[265]  God calls sinners to receive salvation and calls saints to receive the reward.
[266]  Salvation is given through the righteousness of the Lord Jesus.
[267]  The meaning of justification is deeper than the meaning of forgiveness of sins.
[268]  Forgiveness of sins means that even though we have sinned, God has forgiven our sins.
[269]  Justification means that God not only forgives our sins, but also justifies us.
[270]  Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus is justified by God.
[271]  We should not only believe that each one of us has been justified by God, but we should also always have the boldness of justification to stand before God.
[272]  Sometimes we may be weak and we may stumble, fail, or sin, yet we are still justified by God; our justification will not change because of our sins.
[273]  No matter what our condition is, we have the right to believe that every day we are justified by God through the Lord Jesus' merit.
[274]  Believers are justified by the Lord of the heavens and the earth: "It is God who justifies" Rom 8:33 Grace is the source of justification: "By His grace" Rom 3:24 "By grace you have been saved" Eph 2:8 "Having been justified by His grace" Titus 3:7 Justification is based upon the obedience of Christ: "Through the obedience of the One" Rom 5:19 "Becoming obedient even unto death" Phil 2:8 The price of justification is the precious blood of Christ: "In His blood" Rom 5:9 "Through His blood" Eph 1:7 Justification is gained by faith: "Out of faith" Rom 5:1 "Through faith in Jesus Christ" Gal 2:16 "Everyone who believes" Acts 13:39 The proof of justification is the resurrection of Christ: "Was raised for our justification" Rom 4:25 "Having been raised from the dead" Rom 6:6-9 "Raised us up together" Eph 2:6 The result of justification is good works: "Faith without its works is useless" James 2:20-26 "Let your light shine before men" Matt 5:16 "Zealous of good works" Titus 2:14 "Be careful to maintain respectable works" Titus 3:8 "For good works...that we would walk in them" Eph 2:10
[275]  Many doctrines in the Bible have three aspects, including the doctrine of sanctification.
[276]  The believer, upon receiving the blood of Jesus Christ to cover his sins, is sanctified positionally before God Heb 10:10 .
[277]  The believer, being sanctified by the work of the Holy Spirit, is experientially delivered from the evil and bondage of sin by the word of God daily John 17:17-19 .
[278]  At the coming of Christ, the spirit, soul, and body of the believers will be wholly sanctified 1 Thes 5:23 .
[279]  We are sanctified by God the Father: "In God the Father" Jude 1 "Without blemish" Eph 1:1-4 "You shall be holy" 1 Pet 1:15-16 We are sanctified in Christ Jesus: "In Christ Jesus" 1 Cor 1:2, 30 "Are all of One" Heb 2:11 "For by one offering" Heb 10:10, 14 We are sanctified in the Holy Spirit: "In the Holy Spirit" Rom 15:16 "In the Spirit" 1 Cor 6:11 "In sanctification of the Spirit" 2 Thes 2:13 We are sanctified through the blood of Jesus Christ: "Through His own blood" Heb 13:12 "The blood of Christ" Heb 9:14 "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us" 1 John 1:7 We are sanctified by faith: "By faith" Acts 26:18 "Cleansing their hearts by faith" Acts 15:9 "Has overcome the world our faith" 1 John 5:4 We are sanctified in the truth: "In the truth" John 17:17-19 "Through the word of God" 1 Tim 4:5 "By your obedience to the truth" 1 Pet 1:22 The believers must be sanctified in everything: "Sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body" 1 Thes 5:23 "But sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts" 1 Pet 3:15 "Pursue...sanctification" Heb 12:14
[280]  In the Greek language, the word "church" is ekklesia.
[281]  This word is very hard to translate, and "church" can hardly express the meaning of the word.
[282]  Its original meaning is the called-out congregation or the called-out ones gathered together.
[283]  Hence, "church" is the name given to those who are called out of the world by the grace of God to meet together.
[284]  Therefore, those who are not called out of the world do not belong in the church.
[285]  "All those who believed" Acts 2:44 "Those who were being saved" Acts 2:47 "Those who had believed" Acts 4:32 "The church...apostles" Acts 8:1 "The church...disciples" Acts 11:26 "Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints" 1 Cor 1:2 "The saints" 2 Cor 1:1 "His Body" Eph 1:23 "His Body" Col 1:24
[286]  "Convicted those without " 1 Cor 14:24-25 The work of the church: Evangelizing Matt 28:19 Witnessing Luke 24:47-48 Announcing the word Acts 8:1, 4 Praying Acts 12:5 Suffering Rom 8:17 Living to the Lord 2 Cor 5:15 Glorifying God Eph 3:21 Making known to the enemies the wisdom of God Eph 3:10 Presented to Christ Eph 5:27 Satisfying Christ Isa 53:11 Awaiting the return of the Savior 1 Thes 1:10; Phil 3:20
[287]  Some think that when the last day comes there will only be a general judgment for all.
[288]  They assume that whether they are Jews, Gentiles, believers, sinners, sheep, or goats, they will all come before God the Father to be set on the left or right.
[289]  But there is no such doctrine in God's Word!
[290]  The sins of the believers have been judged: Time: A.D. 33 Place: The cross John 19:17-18 Basis: The death of Christ Rom 5:8; 1 Cor 15:3 Result: The believers made righteous 1 Pet 2:24; 2 Cor 5:21 The work of the believers will be judged: Time: 1 Cor 4:5; Luke 14:14; 2 Tim 4:8 Place: "In the air" 1 Thes 4:16-17 Basis: "Each one's work" 1 Cor 3:13 Result: "Reward" or "loss," but "he himself will be saved" 1 Cor 3:14-15 The nations will be judged: Time: "When the Son of Man comes" Matt 25:31-32 Place: "The valley of Jehoshaphat" Joel 3:2, 12, 14 Basis: "My brothers" Matt 25:40 Result: Matt 25:46 The dead will be judged: Time: "He has set a day" Acts 17:31 One thousand years after the first resurrection Rev 20:5, 7 Place: "A great white throne" Rev 20:11 Basis: "The things which were written in the scrolls" Rev 20:12 Result: Rev 20:15 A Table of Comparison between III. and IV.
[291]  LESSON TWENTY THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST John 14:3; Hebrews 9:28
[292]  The Bible does not tell Christians to prepare to die, but asks them to watch, wait, and expect Christ to come again.
[293]  He will come again at any time: "Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes" Matt 24:42 "Watch therefore" Matt 25:13 "Eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ" 1 Cor 1:7 "Eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ" Phil 3:20 "And await His Son from the heavens" 1 Thes 1:10 "Awaiting the blessed hope" Titus 2:13 The Lord will come again to the earth with a body: "I go...I am coming again" John 14:2-3 "This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way" Acts 1:9-11 "Will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him" Heb 9:28 "Because the Lord Himself...will descend from heaven" 1 Thes 4:16 The relationship to the church: "Will be caught up...in the clouds to meet the Lord" 1 Thes 4:16-17 "We will be like Him" 1 John 3:2 "Will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory" Phil 3:21 "Will reign with Him" Rev 20:6 "And made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father" Rev 1:6 "And death will be no more, nor will there be sorrow or crying or pain" Rev 21:4 "Not having spot or wrinkle...and without blemish" Eph 5:27 The relationship to the world: "Every knee should bow...on earth" Phil 2:10 "And every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord" Phil 2:11 "They will render an account concerning it" Matt 12:36 "God judges the secrets of men" Rom 2:16 "Go away from Me" Matt 25:41 "Learn righteousness" Isa 26:9 "Neither shall they learn war any more" Micah 4:3 The relationship to Israel: "All Israel will be saved" Rom 11:25-26 "Settles them in their land" Isa 14:1-3 "The ransomed of Jehovah will return...with a ringing shout and eternal joy" Isa 35:8-10 "I will exult in Jerusalem" Isa 65:19-20 "As a meal offering to Jehovah" Isa 66:20 "Will dwell securely" Jer 23:6 "He will reign over the house of Jacob" Luke 1:32-33
[294]  The conditions for a fruitful work in the Lord:
[295]  Abiding in the Lord: "Abide in Me" John 15:4-5 "Bear much fruit" John 15:8 Obedience: "Obey God" Acts 5:29 "Rose up and went" Acts 8:26-27 "Becoming obedient" Phil 2:8 Be filled with the Holy Spirit: "Were all filled with the Holy Spirit" Acts 4:31 "Full of the Spirit" Acts 6:3 Being cleansed by the word: "Cleansing her...in the word" Eph 5:26 "Able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart" Heb 4:12 Prayer: "With one accord in prayer" Acts 1:14 "Had so besought" Acts 4:31 "Help in this by petition" 2 Cor 1:11
[296]  Whoever abides in Jesus must obey Him, be filled with the Holy Spirit, be cleansed by the word, and pray with one accord in one spirit.
[297]  When we read the Bible, we should carefully meditate on the words and should consider the type of people to whom they refer.
[298]  We should know which verses deal with those who do not believe the Bible, those who do not believe in God, those who do not believe in the existence of the spirit and soul, those who do not know they have sins, those who know they have sins, those who are indifferent, those who are eager for their salvation, those who are self-righteous, those who believe but do not have the assurance of salvation, those who have turned away, those who are disappointed, those who love the world, and those who refuse without a reason.
[299]  LESSON TWENTY-TWO OFFERING To whom should we offer?
[300]  "An offering unto the Lord" Exo 35:5 "Well-pleasing to God" Phil 4:18 How to offer: According to set principles: "On the first day of the week" 1 Cor 16:2 According to oneself: "A willing mind" 2 Cor 8:12-13, KJV "Each one of you" 1 Cor 16:2 According to proportion: "Whatever he may have been prospered" 1 Cor 16:2 "Every tithe of the land" Lev 27:30 "The tithes" Mal 3:8, 10 The pleasing offering: "A cheerful giver" 2 Cor 9:7 "Of their own accord" 2 Cor 8:3 The limitation of offering: "All the living that she had" Luke 21:3-4 "The depth of their poverty" 2 Cor 8:2 What kind of offering?
[301]  "Not out of sorrow" 2 Cor 9:7 Based upon what Christ gives: "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ" 2 Cor 8:9 The reward for the offering: "More blessed" Acts 20:35 "Treasures in heaven" Matt 6:20 "God loves" 2 Cor 9:7 "God is well pleased" Heb 13:16 "Pour you out a blessing" Mal 3:10 "In everything always having all sufficiency" 2 Cor 9:6, 8 The manifestation of the offering: "Gave themselves first to the Lord" 2 Cor 8:5 "Abundance of their joy" 2 Cor 8:2 No entreaty is needed 2 Cor 8:4 "Completing out of what you have" 2 Cor 8:11
[302]  LESSON TWENTY-THREE THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT He is the power of life: "Born of...the Spirit" John 3:5 "It is the Spirit who gives life" John 6:63 "The Spirit of the living God" 2 Cor 3:3, 6 He regenerates men with the word of truth: "The word of truth" James 1:18 "Through the living and abiding word of God" 1 Pet 1:23 He is the power of testimony: "Power" Acts 1:8 "As the Spirit gave to them" Acts 2:4 "He will testify concerning Me" John 15:26 He is the power of prayer: "The Spirit...intercedes" Rom 8:26 "Praying in the Holy Spirit" Jude 20 He is the power of knowledge: "Teach you all things" John 14:26 "Teaches you concerning all things" 1 John 2:27 He is the power of guidance: "Was led by the Spirit" Luke 4:1, 14 "Having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit" Acts 16:6-7 "Walk by the Spirit" Gal 5:16, 25 "Do not quench the Spirit" 1 Thes 5:19 He is the power for distributing ministries: "The same Spirit" 1 Cor 12:4-11 He is the One who operates all things within the believer's spirit: "May be with you forever" John 14:16-17 "You were sealed unto the day of redemption" Eph 4:30; see also 2 Cor 5:5 "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit" 1 Cor 6:19
[303]  As we study the Bible, we will know the Spirit.
[304]  The believers must understand the position and work of the Spirit.
[305]  All of God's will is accomplished by the Spirit.
[306]  The devil is full of sin, decadence, and unrighteousness Isa 14:12-14 .
[307]  He was created with beauty, wisdom, fullness, and power.
[308]  He envied man who was created to take his place and damaged man by tempting him to try to be equal with God.
[309]  His nature: "Steal"; "snatches away" John 10:10; Matt 13:19 "Craftiness" 2 Cor 11:3 "He was a murderer from the beginning" John 8:44 He has ten names: "The great dragon typifying cruelty " Rev 12:9 "Serpent typifying the liar " Rev 12:9 "The Devil typifying the tempter " Rev 12:9 "Satan typifying the enemy " Rev 12:9 "The ruler of the world" John 14:30 "The ruler of the authority of the air" Eph 2:2 "The angel of the abyss" Rev 9:11 "The authority of darkness" Col 1:13 "A roaring lion" 1 Pet 5:8 "An angel of light" 2 Cor 11:13-15 His works: "Seeking someone to devour" 1 Pet 5:8 "Sowed tares"; "leaven" Matt 13:25-29, 33 "Blinded the thoughts" 2 Cor 4:4 "Hindered" 1 Thes 2:18 "Accuses...day and night" Rev 12:10 "Destruction of...flesh" 1 Cor 5:5 "Buffet" 2 Cor 12:7 His subordinates: When the last days come, he will be reborn into man and become flesh and be called Antichrist 1 John 2:22 .
[310]  ARE NOT ANSWERED BY GOD Knowing clearly that one has sinned, yet not judging oneself: "I regard iniquity in my heart" Psa 66:18 "The Lord is far from the wicked" Prov 15:29 "Your hands are full of blood" Isa 1:15 "Your sins have hidden His face from you" Isa 59:1-2 Therefore, you should examine yourself whether you have indulged in sins.
[311]  If so, confess immediately to God and forsake them Prov 28:13 .
[312]  The heart of unbelief stops the blessing: "Doubting nothing" James 1:6-7 "If you believe" Matt 21:22 "Must believe that He is" Heb 11:6 Thanks be to God, for His gift is real.
[313]  Therefore, we can come before Him and apply the apostles' prayer, saying, "Lord, Increase our faith" Luke 17:5 .
[314]  One who loves pleasure loses the heart to fellowship with God.
[315]  Therefore, there is no grace for him from the throne: "Spend...on...pleasures" James 4:3 "Lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God" 2 Tim 3:4 "Gives...to pleasure is dead while living" 1 Tim 5:6 Pride impedes the mercy of God: "None giveth answer, because of the pride" Job 35:12 "The proud he knoweth afar off" Psa 138:6 "He is able to abase those who walk in pride" Dan 4:37 "God resists the proud" James 4:6; 1 Pet 5:5 A cold heart stops the ascending of prayers: "Smote thrice, and stayed" 2 Kings 13:18 "Because of his...persistence" Luke 11:5-9 An unforgiving heart kills prayers:
[316]  "Neither will your Father...forgive" Mark 11:25-26 The prayers of those who despise or ignore the word of God are worthless and loathsome: "Turneth away his ear from hearing" Prov 28:9 "Great wrath came" Zech 7:11-12 "All Scripture is God-breathed" 2 Tim 3:16
[317]  God will not accept the prayer of those who do not believe that all Scripture is inspired by God.
[318]  Salvation manifests that Christ Jesus is the wisdom of God.
[319]  The following verses compare the wisdom of men to the wisdom of God.
[320]  Since the world comes short of God's wisdom concerning salvation 1 Cor 1:21 , salvation must be preached through God's wisdom, Christ.
[321]  This was done in the past: Freed from the punishment of sins: "Save...from their sins" Matt 1:21 "Forgiveness of their sins" Luke 1:77 "Forgiveness of offenses" Eph 1:7 "Gave Himself for our sins" Gal 1:4 "Being justified freely" Rom 3:24 "Was accounted to him as righteousness" Rom 4:22-25 This righteousness is gained by the sinner by believing in Christ: "Through faith in Christ" Phil 3:9 "Through His name" Acts 10:43 "Through Him" Rom 5:9 "Through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus" Rom 3:24-25 "Accounted to him as righteousness" Rom 4:22-25 Such faith renders three results: Forgiveness of sins Imputation of righteousness Freedom from the punishment of sins forever.
[322]  The Holy Spirit, the practice of overcoming sins: "The Spirit of God dwells in you" Rom 8:9-10, 13 "The Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us" Titus 3:5-6 "Led by the Spirit" Gal 5:16-18 "God who operates in you" Phil 2:12-13 "I in him" John 15:5 "He who is in you" 1 John 4:4 On the negative side, the believers have died with the Lord Jesus.
[323]  There are three elements in redemption: The complete sanctification of the Spirit: "Spirit" 1 Thes 5:23 "For now is our salvation nearer" Rom 13:11 The glorification of the body: "The day of redemption" Eph 4:30 "Will transfigure" Phil 3:20-21 "We will be like Him" 1 John 3:1-3 Partaking of the glory of Christ: "Obtaining of the glory" 2 Thes 2:14 "Glory...I have given to them" John 17:22 The "glory" obtained through sufferings Rom 8:17-18 In brief, by the blood of Christ, we are saved from the punishment of sins; by the Spirit of Christ we are freed from the power of sin; and by the glory of Christ we are delivered from the presence of sin: Righteousness, by His first coming.
