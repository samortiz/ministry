   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-FIVE CHRIST IN THREE STAGES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 5:25-27 presents Christ to us in three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 25 says that Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here we see Christ in the stage of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 26 speaks of Christ sanctifying the church, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this verse we have Christ in the stage of the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Finally, a third stage of Christ is revealed in verse 27, which speaks of Christ presenting the church to Himself in His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, in this stage Christ will be the Bridegroom receiving His Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first of these three stages was in the past, the second is in the present, and the third will be in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first stage Christ was the Redeemer; in the second, He is the life-giving Spirit; and in the third, He will be the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this message we need to consider certain points found in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, I wish to point out that our concern is not doctrinal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Lord s recovery there is no need for us to pay very much attention to doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The important matter is that we see what a Christ we have and come to experience and enjoy Him more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although Christ is God, He is not God only.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If He were simply God, He could not be our Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be the Christ to us, He had to be incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through incarnation, Christ became a man with flesh, blood, and bones.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How wonderful that God put on human nature!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our God is not merely God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Christ He has become a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was in the flesh that the Lord gave Himself up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He had not given Himself up as a man in the flesh, there would have been no way for us to gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not spirits; we are flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Angels are spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has no intention for us to become spirits like angels.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s concern is not with angels, but with men of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing is more pleasing to God than a man of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At times we regret that we are fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, if we see ourselves from God s point of view, we shall realize that there is a positive aspect of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Hebrews 2, Christ did not take on the nature of angels, but He did take on blood and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, John 1 says that the Word which was God and was with God became flesh v. 14 . Great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 . God cannot be manifest in angels; He can be manifest only in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The portion of the angels is to behold the manifestation of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Word became flesh and God was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yes, we must condemn the sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But there is also a positive aspect of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are not spirits as angels are we are flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our Christ did not become an angelic spirit; He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Christ who gave Himself up for us was God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If Christ had not put on human nature, it would be impossible for us to receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The very Christ we take as our person is the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is impossible for us to take in God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only after God has become the God-man can we take Him into our being to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A PROPER HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some Christians think that they should behave as if they were angels.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They try to live like heavenly beings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the eyes of God, this kind of living is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He does not want His children to imitate angels; on the contrary, He wants them to be very human.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the members of the church should have a genuine humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For this reason, Ephesians, a book dealing with the church, covers various human relationships: the relationship between wife and husband, between children and parents, between servants and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order to have a proper church life, we must have a proper human life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The very Christ we have received and gained is not an angel or some kind of heavenly being, but a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It was as a man in the flesh that He gave Himself up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, it is as a man that He is able to fit into our situation and meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He has put on human nature in order to be like us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now He lives in us as our life and as our person to be manifested from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When a sister takes Christ as her person in submitting to her husband, her submission will be glorious, full of the reality of Christ lived out from within her.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Likewise, when a brother takes Christ as his person in loving his wife, Christ will be expressed in his love for her.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such a manifestation of Christ is possible because as the God-man He gave Himself up for us.</S>
