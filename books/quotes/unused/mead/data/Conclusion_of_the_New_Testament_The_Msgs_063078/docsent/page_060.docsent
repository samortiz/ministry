   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Lion-Lamb, the Overcoming Redeemer, Opening the Scroll of God's Economy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the divine administration Christ, as the Lion-Lamb, the overcoming Redeemer, opens the scroll of God's economy Rev 5:3-7; 6:1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12; 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Revelation 5:1 the One sitting on the throne has a scroll in His hand sealed with seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These seven seals are the contents of the scroll, and the scroll itself is the new covenant, enacted with the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the new covenant is a scroll covering the redemption of the church, Israel, the world, and the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see the secrecy of God's administration in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Throughout the centuries, wise men have earnestly tried to learn the secret of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But they failed because they did not have the revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although the new testament was enacted by the death of Christ, it has been a mystery to mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the book of Revelation the resurrected and ascended Christ opens the scroll of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As the One who opens the scroll, Christ is portrayed as the Lion-Lamb, as the overcoming Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Revelation 5:5 we have this word: "Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then verse 6 goes on to speak of a "Lamb standing as having been slain."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is both the fighting, victorious, and overcoming Lion and the Redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Lion, He is the Fighter against the enemy, Satan; as the Lamb, He is the Redeemer for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has fought to redeem us, and He has won the battle over the enemy and accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Lion of the tribe of Judah, Christ has overcome the enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He has solved this problem for God and has removed the hindrances to the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's purpose needs someone to carry it out who can solve all the problems of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The problems which God had were the rebellion of Satan and the fall of man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the Lion, Christ has defeated rebellious Satan, and as the Lamb He has taken away the sin of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because He has solved these problems for God, He is worthy to open the scroll of God's economy and its seven seals.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ opens the first four seals in Revelation 6:1-8.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These seals comprise four horses with their riders in a four-horse race.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These riders are not real persons but personified things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The rider of the second horse, the red horse, is war v. 4 ; the rider of the third horse, the black horse, is famine vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>5-6 ; and the rider of the fourth horse, the pale horse, is death v. 8 . According to historical facts, the rider of the first horse, the white horse, is the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>White signifies clean, pure, just, and approvable.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The white horse with its rider is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel which is clean, pure, just, and approvable both to men and to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Immediately after Christ's ascension, these four things the gospel, war, famine, and death began to run like riders on four horses and will continue until Christ comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The opening of the fifth seal Rev 6:9 discloses Christian martyrdom from the first century to the time near the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the gospel is being preached, there is always the martyrdom of the faithful saints.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Revelation 6:12 Christ, the overcoming Redeemer, opens the sixth seal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This seal, which marks the beginning of supernatural calamities, is God's answer to the cry of the martyred saints in the fifth seal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the opening of the sixth seal, the Lord comes in to shake the earth and the host of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This great shaking will be a warning on earth to repent and turn to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This calamity is not the actual wrath of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rather, it indicates that God will soon come in to avenge the martyred saints and to vindicate Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whereas the first four seals of the scroll of God's economy are simultaneous, the fifth and sixth seals are consecutive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The seventh seal includes everything from after the sixth seal to eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the seventh seal, consisting of the seven trumpets, is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation 8:1 says that when the Lion-Lamb "opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This silence indicates solemnity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the opening of the seventh seal, all heaven becomes silent because the age is about to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The period before the opening of the seventh seal was the age of God's toleration.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For the sake of His purpose of preaching the gospel to produce the churches to fulfill His eternal plan, God has been tolerating the sinful situation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But with the opening of the seventh seal the age of toleration is terminated, and another age is brought in the age of God's wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The opening of these seven seals is Christ's work as the overcoming Redeemer in the divine administration.</S>
