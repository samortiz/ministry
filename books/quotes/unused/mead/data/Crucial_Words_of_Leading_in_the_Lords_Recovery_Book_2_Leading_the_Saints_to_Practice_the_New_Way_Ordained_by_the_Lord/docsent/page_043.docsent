   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN LEARNING THE TRUTH FOR PROPHESYING 3 THE CHURCH SERVICE TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING OPEN TO ALL THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The new way is entirely open to all the saints and all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All of the opportunities in church service preaching the gospel, home meetings, and group meetings are open to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are many opportunities for us to function, and we all need to function to preach the gospel and to participate in home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Presently, there are about ten thousand who attend the various meetings home meetings, group meetings, and district meetings of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who attend are not merely numbers; each one represents an actual person with a name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In addition, there are approximately ten thousand saints who have become dormant over the years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have also contacted over thirty-eight thousand people through door-knocking during the training.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are now able to take care of only eight thousand, but the remaining thirty thousand are left unattended.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Through the brothers study and fellowship, we have found that it is worthwhile to continually labor on at least twenty thousand of these newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to this calculation, there are at present about forty thousand brothers and sisters who are waiting for us to labor on them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This demonstrates that if we temporarily stopped knocking on doors to gain new ones, we would still have forty thousand people waiting to be led and served.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through our fellowship with all the churches and our consideration before the Lord, we feel that there are three places that urgently require our care and our labor Tainan, Taichung, and Hsinchu.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should pay attention to the campus work in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we ignore the campus work in these places, it is like eating chickens but ignoring their eggs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That would be pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if we labor in these places, we will have to divert a part of the energy from Taipei, which still requires our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, because of the great need and high quality of people in Taipei, many things can still be learned in this large church, that is, unless we do not have the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we have the heart, we should remain in Taipei to observe and compare all the different aspects, whether right or wrong, whether good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we would do this, we will receive much benefit, and at minimum our field of vision will be broadened.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>ENDEAVORING TO PURSUE THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>IN ORDER TO PROPHESY WELL</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today in the church there is not only the need to take the lead well and to teach well, but there is also the need to prophesy well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are currently ninety-six districts in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If in every district there is a prophet who can minister the word strongly and speak God s words precisely, accurately, and to the point, the entire church in Taipei will be able to spread rapidly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a person were to ask why we stay in Taipei and do not go elsewhere after having been in the church for so many years, we should answer by saying, I am waiting for the ninety-seventh district to be formed so that I may go and be a prophet there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If all of us strive to press on in this way, perhaps two hundred districts will be produced by the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Each of these two hundred districts will need at least two prophets, and for this reason, we need to endeavor to exercise to be prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In fact, if there is a strong prophet in each district, the situation will stabilize.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if the leading is not adequate, the condition of the district will be fine if there is a strong prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if the teaching is not satisfactory, the teaching can be strengthened in the prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if all the other aspects are strong except for the prophesying, the manifestation will be poor and the need will not be met.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul realized the importance of prophesying; thus, he wrote 1 Corinthians 14, an entire chapter concerning the matter of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In verse 1 he says to desire earnestly...that you may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In verse 39, the last verse, he again charges, Desire earnestly the prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moreover, in verse 12, in the middle of the chapter, he says, Seek that you may excel for the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this chapter Paul repeatedly spoke of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His hope for the church was that the church would prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 1 says, Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this verse Paul speaks of three things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, he speaks of love, which is easy to understand and is appreciated by everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Next, he speaks of the need to desire earnestly spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then Paul goes on further to say that in desiring spiritual gifts, one should especially desire to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word prophesy is rendered speak the word as a prophet in the Chinese Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Prophesying is a big lack in Christianity and has been neglected even among us because of the harm done by the traditional concept and system.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now that the old system has passed away, everything in the church life is open to the saints, and everyone has the opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is a great opportunity for all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the elders in all the churches rise up to urge the saints to learn the truth, dive into the truth, and enter into the riches of the spiritual publications, the content of the church life will be greatly enriched.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Currently, among the churches in the United States, the churches in Texas are the best in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Life-studies are everywhere in the saints homes in the bedrooms, on the dressers, on the nightstands, and even in the bathrooms and kitchens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In their homes there is no place without at least a few Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Each saint s home is full of spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A person can go to any corner of the saints homes and receive benefit by opening and reading any paragraph on any page of any book.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the significance of the saying Reading is always beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Such an atmosphere is worth promoting.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>People in the world pay much attention to education and know that education is the foundation of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the church we highly regard the truth; hence, we should pay much attention to the cultivation of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the truth is given the free way and the proper standing among us, the church will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Studying the truth is basic and fundamental, and we should pay much attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am afraid that although many brothers and sisters purchase the Life-studies, they merely put them on their bookshelves without spending much time to read them; this is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Recovery Version of the New Testament is the crystallization of the collection of the knowledge of the divine revelation seen by all the saints throughout the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we study properly by entering into the text and footnotes of the Recovery Version and by entering into the Life-studies, the church life will undergo a noticeable change.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we enter into the riches of the Recovery Version and the Life-studies, within a few years the outcome will be astonishing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our entering into the riches of the truth will be a great help to the success of the new way, because the success of the new way depends upon speaking the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In order to speak the Lord s word properly, we need the proper materials, preparation, foundation, and base.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, people who speak Mandarin or Taiwanese do not all have the same degree of proficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A person with an elementary school education speaks in a certain way, whereas one who has received a high school education speaks in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Moreover, a person who has received a college education speaks in an even more sophisticated manner.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A person s level of education has a definite effect on his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today our spiritual education is fully related to the Bible; however, most people read the Bible according to their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Bible is not easy to apprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even if we read it a hundred times, we may still not be able to understand its meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because it is not easy to understand the Bible, people tend to read it according to what they think they understand based on their particular knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the Recovery Version of the New Testament there are over nine thousand footnotes to help us understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Bible verses that are difficult to understand have footnotes to help guide our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we find that the footnotes are inadequate in answering our questions, we can read the Life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>As long as we search carefully according to the chapter and verse, there will always be an explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we study systematically in this way, we will definitely obtain many riches from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Perhaps we may not all be able to buy our own set of the Life-studies of the New Testament, but at least several saints should have one set in common.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>One-third of the set may be at one saint s home, another third may be at another saint s home, and the final third may be at the home of yet another saint.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we do this, we can read according to a monthly rotation.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In terms of the application of our time, the brothers and sisters with jobs can put a book in their briefcase and bring it with them.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>While they wait for the bus or have a break at work, they can freely read a few pages.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In short, we must try our best to urge the saints to pursue to know the truth, which comes from familiarity with the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the base, the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When the saints have this base, this foundation, we should then encourage them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When Brother Nee first promoted the matter of everyone speaking, he proposed that we use the brothers meetings and sisters meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In this way everyone could exercise together.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This way was good because there were no chairmen or leaders in the brothers meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Everyone was a brother and was absolutely equal.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Everyone was free to call hymns, pray, and give testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, eventually we did not how to go on in these meetings because the meetings depended primarily upon everyone giving their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In half a year everyone had exhausted their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The same situation occurred in the sisters meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hence, it is not easy for the brothers and sisters to learn to speak the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>There are three practices that can strengthen the participation in the meetings: first, calling on the name of the Lord; second, pray-reading the Lord s word; and third, sing-speaking the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>These practices are a great help to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When we come to a meeting, we can begin by calling on the name of the Lord, then we can find a verse from the Bible, read it, and pray over it.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We can also begin by choosing a hymn and sing-speak it together; these practices will be a great help.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Moreover, there are several crutches that can help us speak: the Life Lessons and the Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If we think that these two sets of books are too rigid, there is a third crutch, the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>If some think that the Life-studies are too broad, there is yet a fourth crutch, that is, the other spiritual publications, such as The Knowledge of Life, The Experience of Life, and God s New Testament Economy.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>All these books are our crutches for us to use.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>They are there to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>For the long term, however, we must help the brothers and sisters to learn to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Without prophesying, nothing can be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The key to our advancing is that we who love the Lord and His recovery must learn to prophesy; some must advance in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>For a school to do well in basketball, not every student needs to play basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Out of one thousand students, there may be five or six teams, that is, thirty to fifty basketball players.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>In the church in Taipei there are several thousand brothers and sisters who love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If they exercise to speak, some competent prophets will soon be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>For this reason, I hope that hall by hall and district by district the elders in the church in Taipei will take this word and immediately begin to lead the brothers and sisters to exercise to read the Bible, the footnotes, the Life-studies, and other related spiritual publications.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In this way, over a period of several months and years, the saints will unconsciously acquire a deposit of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Moreover, we all need to acquire some experience.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we have the practical experience as well as the truth, we will have light when we speak for the Lord.</S>
