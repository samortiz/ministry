Because I did not want my superiors to misunderstand, I asked a friend to explain for me. I was surprised when my superior's secretary returned my letter of resignation the same day that I handed it in. Today is Monday, and I went in to personally ask to resign. My superior refused to accept my resignation again. I asked him to find a replacement for me as a department head as soon as possible. I told him that I could wait for a short period of time. He agreed to consider it for a few days and said that I was not old enough to retire, nor was I physically disqualified for work. I have been very frustrated. It appears that I will have to insist on my retirement. My desire is to leave my job, and I have quit twice in four days. I am in a dilemma; I cannot resolve it. I hope you could give me some direction as to how to plan the next step.</p><p>Brother Lee Shi-chun also studied chemistry. He used to make soap and now wants to start his own business. Every time there is a meeting I must travel more than twenty miles. It is really difficult and time consuming. If we had one billion, we could be partners in a small soap factory. We would sell our products in the brothers' stores or market stalls.</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Yu-lan<br />April 26, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: 30 Tse Tang Alley, Chung Shan East Road, Nanking</p><h2 class="head2">Letter Two</h2><p>I wrote a second letter of resignation and received the following answer: "Please be constrained to remain. Wait until I return from America to discuss this." My supervisor will go to America for three months on the nineteenth. I think it will be hard to resign. I plan to wait for three months before doing anything else. When are you coming to Nanking? The church here has no way to care for the saved ones. We cannot nourish the children we beget. We plan to have a baptism meeting on the twenty-first. I can do nothing. I am not good at nourishing. I hope you will come to make some arrangements.</p><p>Peace to you in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Yu-lan<br />May 10, 1948</p><h2 class="head1">THE SIGNS OF KNOWING ONESELF</h2><p>When my mother returned during summer vacation last year and passed through Shanghai, you asked how I was doing. You asked because I had sent you a letter. I have been bothered about this because I should have sent a letter long ago telling you of my current situation, lest you worry.</p><p>I confess that much of the time I am in the valley of the shadow of death with darkness on all sides. It seems that I am in a hopeless situation. There is no human hope left, and God is hidden from me. Despite this, I have passed through all these circumstances. They only prove the words: "My grace is sufficient for you." If I recounted God's leading over the past few years, I am afraid that you would not have the patience to listen. I can only briefly give an outline. In general, all that I have passed through has caused me to know myself. I have also gradually learned that apart from dying to all things, man cannot gain God Himself; he can only gain gifts. Whether in the church, in my family, or in my personal life, God is constantly dealing with me so that I do not have any desire apart from Him. I know that if a man can really deny himself, he will enter true rest and peace. A man does not have peace, rest, or happiness because he loves himself. I do not know if I am right in saying this or not.</p><p>Thank you for your concern. I am very well. I have many difficulties, but I believe God can resolve them.</p><p>Respectfully,<br />XX<br />March 31, 1948</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
