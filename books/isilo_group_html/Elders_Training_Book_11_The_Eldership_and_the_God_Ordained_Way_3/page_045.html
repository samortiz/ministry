The telephone may be used for this purpose. One person can be scheduled at 6:15 a.m., the next person at 6:30, and the next person at 6:45. Within one hour, you could contact three persons in the morning. You could contact the same three persons every morning to pray-read with them, fellowship with them, and enjoy Christ with them in a very brief way. Within three months each person can be contacted at least eighty times. After three months of this kind of consistent contact, these ones can be gained for the Lord's interest.</P><P>Logically speaking, this practice works, but will we do it? Of course, when we endeavor to have morning watch with other brothers, we should ask them what time will be convenient for them, and try to fit into their schedule. We should restrict our time with them in the morning to pray-reading the Word and having a little fellowship about the enjoyment of Christ. This practice will enrich us and the ones for whom we are caring. Furthermore, we will gain them.</P><P>After many years of study, I can tell you that it is not necessary to go out to knock on many doors in our labor for the gospel. We should practice selecting and taking care of three people. We should go to see each of them at least once a week. We do not need to talk too much, and we should not be hurried to baptize them. When we went to Taipei in 1986, we were experimenting to find the most effective way to preach the gospel and gain people for the kingdom of God. We found out that we should not baptize people so quickly. Mainly we need to go to visit them again and again, week by week. When we visit them, we should not speak too much of the truth to them, nor should we try to gain them in a quick way. We just need to go to them continually.</P><P>If we visit a person consistently for three months, that will work out a lot. Then we will gain the real and remaining fruit yearly. To take care of three persons in this way for a year is not too slow. Actually, this is very fast. If one-third of the saints in a locality practiced this, the church there could double within a year. We do not need to worry about what to say when we visit people. The main thing we need to do is visit them and contact them consistently.</P><P>I hope that we would take this charge to visit people consistently. We may feel that this is too difficult. But if we cannot contact three persons every day, at least we can see them once a week. After three months, we will have contacted each person twelve times. We will see a positive result from this kind of labor. I want to say again that we should not try to be that quick, looking for quick results. Instead, we should visit people consistently over a period of time. Perhaps we would not read The Mystery of Human Life with someone until we have visited them three times. The fast way does not work well. The slow way works successfully if we persevere. If we continue to visit three persons three times a week, we will see something happen positively. If we want to see our church increased, we must practice this.</P><P>For the preaching of the gospel, the feeding of the new believers, and the perfecting of the saints, we must visit people. A proper elder, a top elder, must be a person who practices visiting people regularly. We may feel that we do not know how to perfect people, but we all can go to them. We should focus our attention on going to see people and letting them see us. This practice will bring in the increase. Because I love the churches, I am concerned for their increase.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
