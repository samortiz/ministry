   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>MAINTAINING THE ABIDING IN THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Abiding in the Lord is the way to maintain and continue in our experience of the fact of being in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As soon as we are saved God puts us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But how can we continually maintain the fellowship with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First John points out two means: the blood and the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. The Cleansing of the Blood</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First John 1 directly and clearly shows us that we need to maintain the fellowship through the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once you have fellowship with God and touch Him, you cannot escape being in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fellowship places you before God, and it also puts you in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once you are in the light, you will inevitably see your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, at first glance the air surrounding us seems to be very clean.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If, however, we observe that same air under intense sunlight, immediately we will notice that there are innumerable dirt particles floating in that air.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without the exposing of the light of the sun we would not be able to see them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Likewise, if we lack the fellowship with God and are therefore not in the light, we can never be conscious of our own mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But once we enter into fellowship with God and we are put in the light, we discover that we are full of impurities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are impurities in our mind, our emotion, our will, our intention, our motive, and even in the consciousness of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we are in the light, our condition surely becomes manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And once it becomes manifest, our conscience will condemn us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there is not the cleansing of the blood, offenses will definitely be present in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once there are offenses in our conscience, the fellowship between God and us is interrupted, and we thus come out from the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, in our daily living there are still many actual sins which could offend our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have previously mentioned such things as going to the movies and losing our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without any need of teaching from others, you, yourself know too well that these things are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As one who is saved, who is in Christ, and who is in the light, you automatically have this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, because of your weakness, you may have done such things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>And because you did those things, there were offenses in your conscience, and you felt that you had come out of the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that very moment you need to be cleansed by the blood of our Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship one with another 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Under the light of such a fellowship, we see our sins and spontaneously confess them before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The blood of Jesus His Son will then cleanse us and remove the offenses from our conscience 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we sense that we are again in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The blood is able to restore and recover our fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This recovery is the maintenance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Old Testament, on the day of atonement, the high priest would bring the blood into the Holy Place and put it upon the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then he would bring it into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, which is to sprinkle it before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hebrews 9 tells us that the Lord Jesus also brought with Him the blood which He shed on the cross, into the presence of God and sprinkled it before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To this day, the blood of the Lord Jesus is still speaking well of us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It speaks on our behalf and is the ground of atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is based on this blood that we confess our offenses before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we thus confess, the Spirit applies the effectiveness of the cleansing of the blood upon our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our conscience is purged of all its offenses, so that there is no more barrier between God and us, and the fellowship is restored.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, our abiding in the Lord is first maintained by means of the blood.</S>
