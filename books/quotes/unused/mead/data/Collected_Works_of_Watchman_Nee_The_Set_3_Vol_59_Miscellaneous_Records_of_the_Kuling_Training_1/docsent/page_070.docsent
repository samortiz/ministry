   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO APPLY THE NAME OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we apply the Lord's name, He will honor it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brothers and sisters, do we see our position?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we have not seen it yet, we cannot work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems as if the Lord is saying, "If you dare to say yes to anyone, I will say yes as well."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the reason the Lord said in Matthew 18:18, "Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord has put His authority in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who are we?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose we become rebellious and disobedient and exercise this name irresponsibly.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Everything will be thrown into confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord says that He will back up whatever promise we give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who do not see the gravity of their responsibility are foolish; they are living in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In receiving the saints, we cannot receive those whom we like and reject those whom we dislike.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are doing it in the name of the Lord, and we cannot be careless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more the Lord entrusts Himself to us, the more careful we must be.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should say, "I am not qualified to use this name.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am afraid of making mistakes."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The greater the commission, the more we should walk in submission.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The responsibility is too great.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only a careless and foolish person will act rashly when he receives such a commission.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, we are not qualified to do things in the Lord's name at all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to experience the Lord's breaking before we can learn obedience little by little, and before we can work in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What if we belong to the category of those described in the Gospels, who use the Lord's name but do not follow Him Mark 9:38 ?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Or what if we are walking after the footsteps of the seven sons of Sceva in Acts, who took it upon themselves to cast out demons in the name of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They acted in the name of the Lord, yet they did not know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The demons ignored them 19:13-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am not asking if we are able to do a certain thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am asking if we dare to do it if the Lord commits His name to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No one working for the Lord should fail to be struck by the aura and tremendous honor of doing things in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is most glorious for the Lord to entrust His name to us when we preach His word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This does not give us license to speak in any way we want.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, we should learn to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not know authority and if we are ignorant about obedience, we will not be able to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every worker of the Lord has to be able to apply the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord has given this seal to us unconditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only a foolish man would dare to use it carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When authority is in my hand, I am induced to greater submission.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I would not dare to be careless or rash.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Gospels the Lord Jesus made reference to His own name no more than twenty times.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But after His resurrection the New Testament speaks of His name more.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Gospel of John speaks of the Lord's name in reference to coming events as does Luke 10.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Acts speaks of His name thirty-seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Acts 4:12 we find that the one thing the Jewish synagogue opposed was this very name.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts records the sequence of events which happened after the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this book we find the greatest number of references to doing things in the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today we have the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can keep this name like a gold or silver coin in our pocket, and we can use it any time we want.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The preaching of the apostles in all the Epistles, beginning with the book of Romans, involves the exercise of this name.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE NAME JESUS AND THE NAME OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is a difference between the name Jesus and the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The name Jesus was given by man to the Lord when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Jesus was His personal name on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Philippians 2, however, tells us that when the Lord resurrected and ascended, God gave Him the name which is above every name, the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The name of Jesus exceeds all other names.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although the two expressions appear to be the same, they are very different in flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Matthew 1 we have the name Jesus, and in Philippians 2 we have the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The two names are different in scope.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After His resurrection, the Lord's name was exalted above all other names.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>BEING SUBJECT TO AUTHORITY AND</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>TAKING THE NAME OF JESUS WITH CARE</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now the name which is above every name has been given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The name of Jesus is living.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The example of a seal is not very appropriate because a seal is dead, while the name of Jesus is living.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This name is more accessible to us than a dead seal.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord says that we can now act in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>How should we act?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We dare not act rashly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must first touch God's authority and know what it means to submit to this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must be subject to it before we dare to use the name of Jesus fearfully.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Our eyes must be opened to see that authority is in the name of Jesus; we do not have any authority in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today God has given us His name; we can walk and act in His name, but we must act the same way as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord received this name through the process of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Before we can apply this name, we must also learn submission.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do not think that the church has fallen into desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>On the one hand, we can say that the church is in ruin.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But on the other hand, it is not in ruin, because the name of Jesus is still here.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The light we have received today is much brighter than at the time of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They only had the beginning; we have the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We are closer to the day of the Lord than Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Therefore, we have to humble ourselves under God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May we not be sloppy or careless in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Today Satan has no authority of his own; all authority is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All the power added together cannot overcome authority, and all authority is in the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It seems as if the Lord is saying, "Go and do whatever you will and say whatever you will; I will honor it."</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For this reason our flesh must be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The name of Jesus is applicable both to God and to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is only a matter of how we are going to apply this name.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>May we prostrate ourselves before God and drive away any spirit of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>May we see greater accomplishments in these days than in the days of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we speak only positively and speak nothing negatively, we will have a continual open door before us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we are absolute in our submission, we will be free to supplicate for others, confess our sins to God, and wait on Him all in the name of Jesus.</S>
