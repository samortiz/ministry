<div class='line'><b>1</b> Born of my father, descended from Adam,</div>
<div class='line'>A life in my flesh is God's enemy.</div>
<div class='line'>I have inherited God's condemnation,</div>
<div class='line'>Death and sin were reigning in me.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> But love eternal appeared and He called me,</div>
<div class='line'>Out from the lost and hopeless race.</div>
<div class='line'>Into His Son now I have been transferred,</div>
<div class='line'>Born of the Spirit, into His grace.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> I am God's child now, free to enjoy Him.</div>
<div class='line'>The Spirit of Life is reigning in me.</div>
<div class='line'>Christ is my walking, my living, my breathing,</div>
<div class='line'>All that I have and ever will be.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> Chosen and guided into His purpose,</div>
<div class='line'>From individual to corporate man.</div>
<div class='line'>Now in His Body, we can experience</div>
<div class='line'>All the unlimited grace of His plan.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> This is the mystery hidden from ages.</div>
<div class='line'>For this God brought us from sinner to son.</div>
<div class='line'>Practical church life, daily transforming</div>
<div class='line'>Into the oneness, God's expression.</div>
