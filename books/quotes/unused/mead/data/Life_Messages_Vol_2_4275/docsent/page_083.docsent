   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO LIVE CHRIST Scripture Reading: John 6:57; 16:9; Gal 2:20; Phil 1:21a</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The central revelation of the Bible is Christ as our life to complete God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is God's eternal plan to have a body of people to manifest Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For God to be expressed through man, He must enter into him and live within him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This God, who thus becomes our life, is Christ, who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>MAN CREATED TO EXPRESS AND CONTAIN GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first chapter of the Bible tells us that God created man in His own image and according to His likeness Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are two reasons why man was created in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first is that he might be able to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Suppose I take a picture of you, but it turns out to look like a tiger.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a picture cannot express you, because it does not look like you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For man to be able to express God, he had to be made in God's image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The second reason is that God might one day be able to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The container must be shaped like its content.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For a glove to contain a hand, the glove must be shaped like a hand, with a thumb and four fingers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a glove is a good fit, the hand feels comfortable in it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When God enters into man, He feels as comfortable as that hand in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He feels that He is where He belongs.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the creation of man God used two materials: one, visible and of the earth; the other, spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Man's body was formed of the dust of the ground Gen 2:7 ; this physical part was not living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Hebrew the word breath is the same as the word translated spirit in Proverbs 20:27.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The breath of life, though it could not be seen, was living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When it came into man, man became a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He then had an outward body, a soul within, and a spirit within that soul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>RECEIVING GOD BY EATING</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spirit is the organ by which man can receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man was created in God's image, yet he did not contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Genesis 1 and 2 man was an empty vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God placed him in a garden and called his attention to the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This tree signified God Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God wanted man to receive Him; the way for man to do this was to eat of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Right at the beginning of the Bible, then, it is plain that God is received into man like food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we eat, the food is broken down metabolically and assimilated by all the cells of our body, thus becoming part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we eat Christ, we become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To speak of eating God is offensive to some Christians; to say that God becomes part of us, in their view is heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But it was the Lord Jesus Himself who said, "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me" John 6:57 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul could declare, "To me to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His very living was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>ONLY ONE COMMANDMENT FOR UNBELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Old Testament there were ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the New, however, there are only two.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first is that we must repent and believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 16:9 says, "Concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For unbelievers the one sin for which they will be judged by God is that of not believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether their behavior is good or bad is inconsequential.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The kind, honest people and the thieves and liars will end up in hell together, if they do not believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The sin for which they will be condemned is that of rejecting Him.</S>
