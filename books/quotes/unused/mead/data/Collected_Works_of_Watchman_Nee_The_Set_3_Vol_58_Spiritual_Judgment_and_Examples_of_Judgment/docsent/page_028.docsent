   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Killing Light</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I will mention another important matter: We need light to bring us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have not received scorching light, we should ask for it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is true that we are weak enough, but when light comes, it makes us even weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we become extremely weak, we die.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are like the lepers; the more the leprosy breaks out in the body, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the whole body is covered with leprosy, the leper becomes clean.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Scorching light brings us to nothingness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Logically speaking, how can a man resurrect if he has never died?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without death there cannot be the possibility of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, any grace that we claim before death takes us further from resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Life, gift, and work should only come to us after death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Genuine light will remain with us until we die.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not the time to ask for life, power, resurrection, and the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the time to ask for a thorough shining of the great light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are in weakness, we should not ask for power immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Death does not require power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is God's mercy that we can die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without death, there can be no life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who have not passed through death cannot have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that the brothers and sisters see this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When you are weak, you should not seek for power, but for light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you find evil in you, you should not ask for an increase in life, but for a stronger shining of the light.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have to say to the Lord, "I need more light, greater light, intense and absolute light from You."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The mistake of our human nature is to seek to be useful when we find out that we are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Has anyone ever realized that resurrection only comes after a consciousness of extreme uselessness?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who find death working in them, but who do not overcome in the end, are engaged in an act of suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who are able to overcome in the end enter the realm of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This does not mean that we should seek death in order to have resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not think that we can exchange death for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All we should do is put ourselves under God's shining.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should say to Him, "I do not ask for power or anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I only ask for light."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our incompetence is absolute, and our corruption is thorough.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we lie down in bed tonight, we do not know if we will rise up tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is strange that many people want to resurrect before they die.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The light has not done enough work in them, yet they seek for recovery and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Let me repeat that we should not pray for resurrection or for power before we have died.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should only pray for the Lord's mercy and light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to allow the Lord to shine on us until we fall flat on our face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not accept help lightly or prematurely when it comes to the matter of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Asking for resurrection before we have died is the greatest hindrance we can pose.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord wants us to fall down, not to climb up.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is impossible for a person, who has not received an intense and absolute shining and who has not crumbled completely, to ask for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Resurrection is God's business, not ours.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Another thing we should beware of is looking inwardly at our spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should never look inwardly to find out if we have received any light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is most foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should trust in God's shining.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should trust in His mercy and trust that He will bring us into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we want to be useful in His hand and want to serve as a deputy authority, we need more shining.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more we see our own weakness and corruption, the closer we are to death, and consequently the closer we are to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Any "grace" that we grasp hold of before we experience the shining of the great light is a delay to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have only one basic need before the Lord, which is to know ourselves as God knows us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God exposes us through the light, and we know ourselves through the light.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May the Lord be gracious to us.</S>
