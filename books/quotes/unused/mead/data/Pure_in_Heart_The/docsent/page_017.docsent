   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEALING WITH THE CONSCIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every saved one has to deal with his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If he does not deal with his conscience, he will not have peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If he does not deal with his conscience, he will not be able to pray properly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he does not deal with his conscience, his Bible reading will be tasteless and his gospel preaching will be powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he does not deal with his conscience, he will not be able to walk the pathway ahead of him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the saved ones have to pass through this stage of dealing with their conscience if they want to go further on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our conscience is like a window and our being is like a room; the light that the room our being receives must pass through the window our conscience .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Originally, there is no light inside of us but only darkness, but our conscience is like a window which allows the light to come in.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before we are saved, our conscience is like an extremely dirty window smudged with putty through which no light can penetrate.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This results in a state of complete darkness in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, once we are saved, the Holy Spirit enters into us to enlighten us, causing our inner being to be full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At this time, we immediately feel that we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we should repent and confess our sins before God, and we should deal with our sins before man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every time we confess or deal with a sin, we wipe the putty-covered window once.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The wonderful thing is that before we wipe the window, we do not know how dirty it is; so the more we wipe it, the dirtier it seems to become.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once we wipe the window even slightly, all the greasy dirt is stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then when the sunlight shines through the window, it seems even dirtier than before.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in the end, the window will be clean.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is the same with our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we were first saved, we may have thought that we had committed only a few small mistakes before God, but after we began to confess these mistakes, we immediately saw many greater sins.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, the more we deal with our sins, the fewer sins we have.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like wiping a window: The more we wipe it, the less greasy dirt it has.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As a result of this process, we have peace within, and spontaneously we can easily pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the rain splashes mud or sand onto a dirty window, we can hardly see anything inside the house; however, after the window has been cleaned, when a little bit of sand or mud is splashed onto the window, we will notice it immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many people have done something wrong yet never sense that they are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This proves that they have never dealt with their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>CONSCIENCE AND FAITH PROCEEDING TOGETHER</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One who desires to proceed on the path of God s life must deal with his conscience, because conscience and faith go together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we pray, we need to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prayer without faith equals not praying at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God listens only to the prayers of faith, and He will not listen to any prayers which are not out of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, once we have a problem with our conscience, faith is gone, and once there is a hole in our conscience, faith leaks away.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can still pray and plead, yet if we do not have faith and our conscience does not have any feeling, we will be like a tire with a hole in it the more air we pump into it, the more air it leaks out and the flatter it becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Timothy 1:19 says, Holding faith and a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The trend of society toward corruption is not something that was there in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It was not this way in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today even the academic circles are full of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Teachers cheat their students, and students deceive their parents.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every place is full of lies.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the case among the young people in particular.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even young people who are Christians tell lies both at home and in school.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They think that it is very difficult not to tell lies.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the reason why they have no progress in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have a feeling when we tell a lie for the first time, we should carefully deal with it and not allow it to pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we tell a lie to someone and do not have peace in our conscience, we have to go to that person and deal with it immediately, saying, I am sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The thing that I just said to you is a lie; it is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way our inner being will be full of light.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Perhaps we will be full of light for three days.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we may encounter another incident and tell another lie.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as this happens, we should deal with the feeling that we receive from our conscience right away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not, then after three or four experiences like this, the feeling in our conscience gradually will be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once the feeling of our conscience is lost, not only will we tell more lies, but we will also do worse things and become shipwrecked regarding the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, I am afraid that many Christians consciences are not able to withstand the test.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A preacher once told me about something that he saw one time when he went to visit a pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When they sat down, the pastor s child came and told his father that someone was looking for him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Then the pastor told his child in front of the preacher, Tell him that I am not home.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This shows us how very easy it is to tell a lie because a lie settles everything.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, once we tell a lie, inwardly our conscience is branded, as if with a hot iron.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we do this again and again, we will have no further feeling in our conscience; our conscience will become deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The conscience of many people is not a living conscience but a deadened conscience because telling lies has become their habit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A Christian will not be able to genuinely pray after he has lied, neither will he be able to genuinely pray after he has lost his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some people say that they have seen Christians who have lost their temper but were able to pray immediately afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are people like this, but God never listens to the prayers of one whose conscience is numb.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If a person does not listen to the voice of his conscience, neither will God listen to that person s voice.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those who do not have any feeling in their conscience certainly do not have faith in their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God does not listen to the prayer of a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once a person s conscience is corrupted, leaking, or numb, he will no longer be able to understand the feeling of his conscience, and God will not listen to the prayer of this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>ALWAYS HAVING A CONSCIENCE WITHOUT OFFENSE TOWARD GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Acts 24:16 Paul said, Because of this I also exercise myself to always have a conscience without offense toward God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A conscience without offense is one that is without holes or leakage.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we confess our sins before God and deal with our sins before man, our inner being will be without sins and our conscience will be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can serve God only with a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If we want our service to touch God, we have to serve with a pure conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If our conscience is not pure, not only will our prayers not be answered, but they will never touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some people s conscience is like a wrecked ship.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although some have forsaken their conscience, those who are saved should not overlook even a small mistake; rather, we should deal with it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We do not need to encourage people to be enthusiastic, because enthusiasm in blindness does not profit anything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we want to follow God in life to walk on the way ahead of us, we must follow Him and fulfill His principles.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If we want to serve and touch God, we must always have the presence of God within us, and we must be full of light and have faith all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this way, light, revelation, life, and power will become our constant experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As long as we thoroughly deal with our conscience, we will be able to walk on this path in a straight and proper way.</S>
