   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>24 And Jesus answered and said to the chief priests and elders of the people , I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell Me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>25 The baptism of John, from where did it come, from heaven or from men?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And they reasoned among themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven, He will say to us, Why then did you not believe him?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>26 But if we say, From men, we fear the crowd, for all hold John as a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>27 And they answered Jesus and said, We do 1 not know.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He too said to them, 2 Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>28 But what do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man had two children.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And he came to his first son and said, Child, go today and work in the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>29 And he answered and said, I do not want to; yet later he regretted and went.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>30 And he came to the other and said likewise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And he answered and said, I will, sir; yet he did not go.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>31 Which of the two did the will of the father?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They said, The 1 first.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>32 For John came to you in the way of 1 righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And you, when you saw it, did not later regret it to believe him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>27 1 This was a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>27 2 This indicated that the Lord knew that the Jewish leaders would not tell Him what they knew; hence, neither would He tell them what they asked.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They lied to the Lord in saying, "We do not know."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the Lord spoke the truth wisely to them, exposing their lie and avoiding their question.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>31 1 In Luke 15:1-2, 11-32, the Lord likened the leaders of Judaism to the firstborn son, and the tax collectors and sinners to the second son; but here the Lord likened them in the opposite order.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that the Jews were the firstborn of God Exo 4:22 and had the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, because of their unbelief the birthright was shifted to the church, which has become God's firstborn Heb 12:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>32 1 The Gospel of Matthew, as the book on the kingdom, stresses the matter of righteousness, for the kingdom life is one of strict righteousness, which we must seek 5:20, 6; 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John the Baptist came in the way of such righteousness, and the Lord Jesus was willing to be baptized by John to fulfill such righteousness 3:15 .</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The events in chapter twenty-one took place during the last week of the Lord's life on earth John 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this period of time He willingly presented Himself to the children of Israel for a thorough examination.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to Exodus 12, the passover lamb had to be examined four full days.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the Jewish calendar, four days could also be considered six days, for part of a day was counted as one day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the last week of His life, Christ was examined for six days.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then He was crucified on the day of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that He was the real Passover Lamb; the lamb in Exodus 12 was a type.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First the Lord was examined by the chief priests and the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The chief priests represented the religious power, and the elders represented the civilian power.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These two powers came together to test Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They asked the Lord where He had received His authority and who had given it to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord Jesus did not answer them directly, but with another question.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way, the Lord Jesus passed the first test, and no defect was found in Him.</S>
