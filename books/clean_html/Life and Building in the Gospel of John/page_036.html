<h2 class="head1">HAVING RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS</h2>
<p>The testimony of John the Baptist was very powerful. When two of his disciples heard these words, they immediately followed the Lord Jesus (John 1:37). Verse 38 says, &ldquo;Jesus, turning and beholding them following, said to them, What are you seeking? And they said to Him, Rabbi (which translated means Teacher), where are You staying?&rdquo; The way they addressed the Lord Jesus shows that their religious concepts were quite strong. Nevertheless, they did not dare to call Him the Christ, the Prophet, or Elijah, because they were not sure who He was. However, they also realized that He was worthy of respect; hence, they addressed Him as &ldquo;Rabbi.&rdquo; Although John the Baptist testified of Him, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God,&rdquo; the two disciples addressed Him as &ldquo;Rabbi.&rdquo; These two titles&mdash;<em>the Lamb of God</em> and <em>Rabbi</em>&mdash;are altogether different.</p>
<p>From these verses we can see the influence of the background of Judaism on the disciples&rsquo; religious concepts. Under the influence of Judaism, people were looking for the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah, and in an environment filled with such religious concepts, the disciples could address the Lord Jesus only as Rabbi. No one recognized Him as the Lamb of God, as the One upon whom the Spirit descended and abided as a dove, or as the One who would baptize people in the Holy Spirit. Without revelation, the disciples were limited by their religious background and could focus only on the Messiah, the Prophet, or Elijah, and based on these religious concepts, they could address the Lord only as Rabbi.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when the two disciples heard the testimony of John the Baptist, they followed the Lord Jesus and asked where He was staying. Our Lord&rsquo;s response shows that He truly is the Lord. He replied, &ldquo;Come, and you will see&rdquo; (v. 39). He did not correct their understanding of Him as being only a Rabbi, nor did He answer their question. He simply asked them to come and see. The Lord was not asking them to come and see His dwelling place, but to come with Him in order to see the Lord Himself. Only the Lord Himself matters, not the place where He stays. If a robber dwells in a palace, the palace is still a robber&rsquo;s den. If a king dwells in a thatched shed, the shed is a palace. No dwelling place is more important than the dweller. Therefore, the Lord Jesus simply said, &ldquo;Come, and you will see.&rdquo; The Lord did not want them to see a dwelling place but to see the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>In order to know a person, we must see that he is more than what he says. What a person is counts more than what he speaks. Everyone in the world is afraid of being seen for who they are, but the Lord Jesus is not. He is not afraid of detailed scrutiny. He even desires that we see Him, because He can bear any amount of scrutiny. He is the same in every situation.</p>
<p>When the two disciples heard the Lord&rsquo;s words, they followed Him and stayed with Him that day (v. 39). The place where the Lord stayed must have been quite simple and primitive; however, when the two disciples stayed with Him, they discovered that He was quite extraordinary and altogether different. They were captured by Him. One of the two disciples was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother. He went to look for his brother Peter and said to him, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah&rdquo; (v. 41). He did not say, &ldquo;We have found the Lamb,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We have found the One who will baptize people in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; On the contrary, he said, &ldquo;We have found the Messiah.&rdquo; Again, this word was based on his religious concepts, but Andrew still led Peter to the Lord Jesus. As soon as the Lord Jesus saw Peter, He said, &ldquo;You are Simon, the son of John; you shall be called Cephas,&rdquo; (which John says is interpreted, Peter) (v. 42). With this simple contact, Peter was gained by the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>The next day the Lord Jesus went forth into Galilee. When the Lord found Philip, He said to him, &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; (v. 43). Philip was probably influenced by Andrew and Peter, so when the Lord called Philip, he followed the Lord. When Philip found Nathanael, he said, &ldquo;We have found Him of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth&rdquo; (v. 45). Philip&rsquo;s words again show the strong religious background at that time. Nathanael rebuked him, saying, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (v. 46). Nathanael said this because he understood from the Old Testament that the Messiah would come from Bethlehem, not from Nazareth. Philip, however, was very quick, and he immediately said, &ldquo;Come and see&rdquo; (v. 46). He could not speak clearly about the Lord, so he asked Nathanael to come and see for himself. When the Lord Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, He said, &ldquo;Behold, truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile!&rdquo; (v. 47). Greatly surprised, Nathanael said to the Lord, &ldquo;How do You know me?&rdquo; Then the Lord Jesus said more clearly, &ldquo;Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you&rdquo; (v. 48). As soon as the Lord said this, Nathanael was subdued, and he said to the Lord, &ldquo;Rabbi, You are the Son of God; You are the King of Israel&rdquo; (v. 49). Although Nathanael confessed that the Lord was the Son of God, he was still influenced by his strong religious background because he also addressed the Lord as Rabbi and as the King of Israel.</p>
