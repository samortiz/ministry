   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through these experiences it is difficult to determine when Peter was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It seems that Peter might have been regenerated when he made the declaration in Matthew 16:16 that Jesus is the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, Peter was undoubtedly regenerated after the Lord breathed Himself into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The earlier experiences seem to have been an accumulation consummating in the experience in John 20:22.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In principle, it is the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because our experiences of the Lord accumulate over time, we may have the feeling that our experiences some years ago were not as genuine as they are today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Though our experiences seem to be very sudden, they are actually an accumulation over many years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The things we see today which seem to be rather sudden will be recognized, after a few years, as having only been steps in a process of accumulation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Often it may seem that we have not seen or experienced very much, when we have actually seen and experienced a great deal without realizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the other hand, we often think that we have seen something, when in reality we have seen and experienced very little.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result, we are easily deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The best way is simply to walk on the pathway of life, day by day, without analyzing very much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Again, the disciples are good examples of this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Peter and the other disciples followed the Lord somewhat foolishly and ignorantly for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is doubtful that Peter was very clear concerning anything he saw during those years with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He seemed to be clear when he spoke concerning Christ being the Son of the living God, but later when asked whether the Lord paid the temple tax, he answered in a very inaccurate way Matt 17:24-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This exposed that he had not seen very clearly that Jesus as the Son of God is not required to pay such a tax.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As the Lord was going to Jerusalem to be crucified, the disciples also argued among themselves as to which one of them would be the greatest Mark 9:33-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They did not care for the Lord or for what He had told them concerning His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It seems that after three and a half years the disciples saw very little and that the time the Lord spent with them was wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It even seemed that the sisters, such as Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jesus, and the mother of James and John, saw much more than the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although this may be true, actually, all but Judas received something from the Lord in those years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must realize that any time we spend with the Lord is never a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more time we spend with the Lord, the more we learn, and the more a treasure is accumulated within our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, we must continue to pursue the Lord according to a good routine.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a routine includes morning watch every morning, walking by the Spirit each day, and attending the meetings regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In spite of all our failures, we should still keep such a routine.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This kind of exercise before the Lord will never be a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Question: I have a question concerning ministering to others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many times when I am in the home meetings and the atmosphere is living, I share something with the new believers which is right in doctrine but the flavor seems to be me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Will there be a time in our ministry to others when we sense that the Lord has a clear way through us without any flavor of ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Answer: Our feelings are just like the weather extremely variable and untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning our ministry, we should just go and minister, not analyzing too much.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should just labor in the home meetings, small group meetings, and big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, we will see the Lord's blessing and we will reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to my experience, quite often I thought that I accomplished very little when I ministered in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To my feeling, it was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then a number of years later, quite a number of saints from that place shared with me that they were really helped by the message I had given earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, when I have shared at other times, I had the feeling that I had reached the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, there was not the great result that I expected.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Though many Christians seek so-called spirituality, we must realize that we will eventually be very human.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We also must realize that our flavor will be with us even when we enter into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The New Testament was written by many writers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we read Peter's writing, we know that it is Peter, because it has the flavor of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Likewise, when we read Paul's writing, there is the flavor of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even in the New Jerusalem, we will not lose our personal identity and flavor.</S>
