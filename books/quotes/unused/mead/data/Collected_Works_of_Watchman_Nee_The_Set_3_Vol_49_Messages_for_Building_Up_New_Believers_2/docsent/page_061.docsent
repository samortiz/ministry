   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE OCCUPATION Scripture Reading: 2 Thes 3:10-12</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Occupation is very important to a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If one chooses a wrong occupation, he will not be able to go on in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Christian must pay attention to the matter of choosing an occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I. THE GOD-ORDAINED OCCUPATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURE A. In the Old Testament Age</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After God created man, He prepared an occupation for him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God assigned Adam and Eve the job of guarding and keeping the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The matter of occupation existed before man sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam and Eve's occupation in the beginning was that of a gardener; they guarded and kept the garden of Eden which God had created.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After Adam and Eve sinned, the earth no longer rendered service to them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They had to eat in the sweat of their face and till the ground so they could eat Gen 3:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows us clearly that after man's fall, his God-ordained occupation was to be a farmer and to till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man has to till the ground in the sweat of his face in order for the earth to yield food to him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To this day farmers are still the most honest kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the beginning God ordained man to till the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Genesis 4 Cain was a tiller of the ground and Abel was a keeper of sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Here sheep farming came in. This shows us that shepherding is also an occupation that is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After this, when men began to multiply on the earth, there arose all kinds of craftsmen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There were blacksmiths, coppersmiths, makers of musical instruments, and artificers in brass and iron 4:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By the time of the tower of Babel, there were bricklayers and carpenters 11:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although building the tower of Babel was wrong, men were nevertheless learning to build.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence the coppersmith, blacksmith, maker of musical instruments, and craftsman are all proper occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Genesis 12 God chose Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was a herdsman.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He had many cattle and sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jacob also had flocks of cattle and sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This shows that their main occupation was animal husbandry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Israelites were in Egypt, they worked as craftsmen, burning bricks for Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after they came out of Egypt, God promised them a land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Clearly, we see two occupations: raising livestock and farming.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The grapes of the land required two people to carry them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This proves that there was farming.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God said that if the Israelites disobeyed Him and worshipped idols, He would cause the heavens to be as brass and the earth to be as iron; the heavens and the earth would not work for the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This shows clearly that the occupations in the promised land of Canaan consisted of tilling the earth and raising livestock.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These were the occupations in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. In the New Testament Age</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus' parables in the Gospel of Matthew show us that farming is a basic occupation in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, in chapter thirteen we have the parable of the sower, and in chapter twenty we have the parable of the vineyard.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Luke 17 speaks of a slave coming back from plowing or tending sheep in the field.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In John 10 the Lord said that the good Shepherd laid down His life for the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, raising livestock and farming are the basic God-ordained occupations for men.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord called twelve apostles, most of whom were fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The one who was a tax collector was told by the Lord to drop his occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But it was as if He said to the fishermen, "Once you were fishermen.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But from now on, I will make you fishers of men."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows that fishing is also an acceptable occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Luke was a physician, and Paul was a tentmaker.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Tentmaking is different from fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>With tentmaking, labor is added to basic raw material.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Tilling the ground produces material directly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Making fabrics, tailoring, or making tents add labor to raw material to manufacture finished goods.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I can only say that from the Old Testament to the New Testament, God has arranged certain occupations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord's disciples were either farmers, shepherds, craftsmen, fishermen, or manufacturers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If there were any other occupations at all, the most we can include is "workmen" not the workers who do spiritual work , because the New Testament says, "The workman is worthy of his pay" 1 Tim 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A workman is one who labors manually or who sells his labor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Obtaining wages by manual labor is also an acceptable occupation in the Bible.</S>
