   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN A FELLOWSHIP WITH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>YOUNG BROTHERS AND SISTERS Date: Wednesday, February 8, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is a glory to the Lord to see young people being saved and coordinating in the church life for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The book of Numbers shows us that those who are over twenty years of age are qualified to fight, while those who are between thirty and fifty years old are qualified to serve and work within the tabernacle 1:3; 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows us that the young people are particularly precious in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here I would like to mention several frequent causes of failure among young brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then I will point out how they should serve before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>FREQUENT CAUSES OF FAILURE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First, let us consider the frequent causes that lead to failure among young people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We can look at three areas: 1 travel, 2 marriage, and 3 occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Travel</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Travel includes moving, changing schools, and taking trips.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After a young person is saved, he is generally under the protection of the church and his family.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His normal sphere of activity is around his school and home, but when he has to go away for an extended period of time, he should take care of all the pitfalls along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has to clearly identify all the traps and must guard himself from falling into them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is wonderful to stay at home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Day by day he can learn to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He can find the right place to study the Bible and to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On a trip, however, he can easily take in loose thoughts if he is not careful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he does not move around, nothing will happen, but once he moves around, he will find that his journey becomes an opportunity for him to indulge in sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will see many new things and new sights, meet many new people, and come in contact with many new customs and habits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of travel subconsciously opens the door for relaxation to come in within him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He will dare to do many things which he would ordinarily not dare to do.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He will dare to visit places which he would ordinarily not dare to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I want to mention this matter to the young people in particular because most old people like to remain and settle in their old places, while young people like changes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Very often, however, they get into trouble when changing places.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>During the past twenty or thirty years, I can remember many young brothers and sisters who fell because of changing places.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we must not be quick and loose in changing places.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to ask the Lord to preserve us with His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to apply ourselves to good habits now so that we will be able to maintain these habits when the changes come.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever we do, it is best to keep the principle of two by two.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a good pattern that the Lord Jesus left for us Mark 6:7; Luke 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should do everything in coordination, always with two people and perhaps with three or four.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need companions while we are going through changes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This will keep us in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we go to any place alone, we are going as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if two go together, we are not going as two individuals, but as the move of our local church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not underestimate any change or move.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Many experiences in our human life are triggered by little changes in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is true in the case of sisters choosing a school.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is very unsafe for anyone to choose a school that is not being attended by another saint.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you want to go to a new school, it is best to find one with at least two saints in it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many young people fall into snares by acting independently.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For your own protection and for the protection of others, find some companions whenever you make a move.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this matter, you have to remember before the Lord that consecrating yourself does not merely mean offering up material possessions, but being coordinated together, acting in the principle of the Body, and acting upon the ground of the church.</S>
