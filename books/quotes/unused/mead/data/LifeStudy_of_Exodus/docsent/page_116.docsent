   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Satisfying Their Lust with Quails</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The food in Egypt suited the flesh of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The more they ate of Egyptian food, the more fleshly they became, for the Egyptian diet corresponded to the people s flesh and nourished it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Manna, however, was food of another category.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It came from heaven and it caused those who ate it to become heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the children of Israel were murmuring in the wilderness, their murmuring was according to their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that they were murmuring according to the old self, according to the old person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In their murmuring they were not living as God s redeemed people, but as natural people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flesh here does not signify only the lustful part of our being; it signifies the totality of our fallen being, the whole of our old person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although God s people had been redeemed, they were still living like Egyptians, like those who had not been redeemed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For this reason, God sent quails to satisfy their fleshly lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first time He sent quails was in Exodus 16.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although He disciplined the people, His discipline on this occasion was not severe.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The second time the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the people, and Jehovah smote the people with a very great plague Num 11:33, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Numbers 11:34 goes on to say, And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Kibroth-hattaavah means the graves of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before God smote the people with a great plague, He sent quails in abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a miraculous way, the Lord fed the people with quails for thirty days Num 11:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Numbers 11:31 we have a description of the vast number of quails: And there went forth a wind from Jehovah, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day s journey on this side, and as it were a day s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What an abundance of quails!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At first, the people were pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But eventually the quails became loathsome to them, for the people had to eat them until the flesh came out of their nostrils Num 11:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Numbers 11:33 we are told, And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of Jehovah was kindled against the people Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to apply the record in Numbers 11 to our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we continue to lust for worldly things after we are saved, God may give them to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, suppose you lust after a new car.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God may give it to you in order to fulfill your lust, but He will not be happy in doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, He will give you what you lust after in order to show you His glory, His anger, and His sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Just as God sent an abundance of quails to the children of Israel, He may give you so many cars that they become loathsome to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God will give you what you lust after, but you may experience His displeasure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sooner or later, the very cars you lust after will become loathsome to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have known some believers who had a great love for money when they were young Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But after they became rich, the money they loved became loathsome to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, they suffered spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All Christians today need to hear the teaching of the Word concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I would encourage all the saints not to love the world and not to lust according to the flesh after worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But this is the very thing many Christians are doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In order to satisfy their lusts, they are pursuing the things of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God may allow them to have what they desire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This, however, is not a positive sign.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not think that if God gives you what you lust after, He agrees with you, He is happy with you, or He intends to edify you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the contrary, this is a sign of His anger and displeasure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Most of today s Christians have been smitten by God in His anger.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason, with them there is no life, only spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I hope that all the saints in the Lord s recovery, especially the young people, will learn to forget the world and not to lust after Egyptian things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The God who has saved us is real, living, faithful, and purposeful, and He will take care of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need for us to lust after worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are no longer worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are God s chosen people, and He wants us to live a heavenly life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I can testify that the Lord is faithful and worthy of our trust.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through my experience I have learned not to act on my own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Anything I do in myself will displease the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I repeat, the Lord wants to be everything to us and to do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is His desire to give us heavenly food, to rain manna upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By partaking of this heavenly food, we shall be a heavenly people living a heavenly life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This will make us altogether different from worldly people.</S>
