   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 The believer has the Holy Spirit dwelling in his spirit, yet at the same time his body is possessed by evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Therefore, he has the experience of a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In his spirit he has fellowship with God, but evil spirits manifest their works in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believer must not think that whatever he does in his outward body must be something from God just because he has fellowship with God in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He should realize that because he is regenerated, his new life will always have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One thing is certain: a life that is truly filled with the Holy Spirit will never have an experience of a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A double personality indicates that a person is possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With those who are less deceived, a double personality is not as obvious as it is in the ones mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes a believer may find that someone besides himself and outside of him is laying hold of his faculties.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many thoughts that are not from him may come rolling in. His will may seem to be paralyzed, numb, and unable to decide, choose, or determine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His imagination and memory may seem to be locked up by someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He cannot remember or think about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His reasoning may seem to be somewhat cold and hard, and he may not know how to think logically.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many unexpected words, behaviors, and attitudes may proceed out of him without the consent of his will, which he finds unable to control.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a more hidden manifestation of a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The meaning of a double personality is the existence of two independent, human, and personified entities.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It means that there is no need for the person to exercise his own will to decide anything, that his soul and body, in part or in whole, can move surprisingly on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It means that outside of man's will, there is still another will, which directly rules man's soul and body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A demon-possessed believer is one who has the will of evil spirits in him in addition to his own.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A demon-possessed believer is one whose own will is suppressed and over whom the will of the evil spirits reign.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a double personality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a believer has a double personality, there are two kinds of power in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sometimes the Holy Spirit sends out His power from the believer's inner man, and sometimes evil spirits direct their power from the believer's outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes the Holy Spirit expresses His grace, blessing, and light, and sometimes evil spirits also display their works from the believer, which are counterfeits of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They will cause him to see visions, laugh wildly, sing loudly, cry sorrowfully, or feel a kind of numb happiness surging through his body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today there are numerous workers who have this double personality!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there are few who can discern the spirits!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Satan will use this kind of people to accomplish his work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because many of the things they do are spiritual and of God, believers are afraid to reject what Satan puts behind them later.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The believers will talk about what is of God among these things and say, "Are not these things very good?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The believers forget that this is the mixed work of evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan always does a work of mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The principle of all his works is to sow tares among the wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He does not preach lies only; he preaches truths also.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He uses the truths to trumpet his lies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, he is willing to preach truths more than lies so that his plots will not be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After he gains his ground, he will reverse the original proportion!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can see this mixture in many meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The believers must learn how to discern and prove all things; otherwise, they will be infected by workers with double personalities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They will also fall into passivity and be possessed by demons.</S>
