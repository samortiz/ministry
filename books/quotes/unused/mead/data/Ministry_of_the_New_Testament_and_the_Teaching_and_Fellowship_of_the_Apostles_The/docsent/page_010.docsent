   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not to Be Twisted by Anyone in Any Way</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From Peter's word in 2 Peter 3:16 we can learn one lesson, that is, that God's holy writing should not be twisted by anyone in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible does need some expounding and some interpretation, but we must be careful when we expound the Word of God not to twist it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But to Be Unfolded Rightly</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and Straightly without Distortion</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Instead of twisting the Scriptures, we must unfold them rightly and straightly without distortion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 2 Timothy 2:15 Paul charged Timothy to learn how to cut straight the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Greek the word for cutting straight is a word used in carpentry.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a carpenter cuts wood, he must cut it straight; otherwise, he will spoil the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To unfold the word is to cut the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is to expound the word, to interpret the word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to unfold the Word rightly and straightly, not twisting it or distorting it in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE APOSTLES</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 2:42 mentions not only the teaching of the apostles but also the fellowship of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Any kind of teaching will bring in a certain kind of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kind of fellowship we enter into corresponds to the kind of teaching we are under.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fellowship is always based on teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Fellowship of the Divine Life,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>between the Apostles and the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The fellowship of the apostles is, first, the fellowship of the divine life, between the apostles and the believers 1 John 1:1-3a .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the New Testament the fellowship of Christians is a divine matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a matter of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without life we cannot have any fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is impossible for a dog to fellowship with a bird.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because they have two different kinds of lives, the dog life and the bird life, they are in two different realms, two different kingdoms, the dog kingdom and the bird kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The dog kingdom surely cannot fellowship with the bird kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Likewise, a human being cannot fellowship with a dog, because they have different lives and are in different realms.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A kingdom is always based on life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since we were born of Adam, we are in the human kingdom, the kingdom of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after being born of Adam, we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through regeneration we received the divine life and were transferred into the divine kingdom, the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God," and again, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit" John 3:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The kingdom of God is of another life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unless we are born anew and thereby receive the divine life, we cannot see the kingdom of God, because we do not have the capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This requires the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostles' teaching brings the divine life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we receive the divine life through the apostles' teaching, in that life we immediately have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regardless of our race or nationality, as long as we are saved, when we come together there is spontaneously a fellowship among us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our meeting together is very harmonious because we all have been brought into the divine life, and in the divine life we have fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Fellowship of the Divine Life,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>between the Apostles and God</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1 John 1:1-3 the apostle John told the believers that he brought in the fellowship through the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, between the apostles and the believers there is something that is called fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then the apostle said that this fellowship is not only a fellowship between the believers and the apostles but also a fellowship between the apostles and God v. 3b .</S>
