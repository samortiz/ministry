   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In a sense this is a difficult walk, but it is a closer walk in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a walk of intimacy with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some may say that they have a door widely opened to them in the mission field, but do they have the rest within?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may take the door and drop the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may go somewhere and do a great work, but not have the rest within.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do we want the door or the rest?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The door is in verse 12, and the rest is in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostle Paul was not the same as many Christians are today in their service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They just care for the door.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But do we have the rest in our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Would we sacrifice the door for the rest?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul paid the price to take care of the rest in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even though the Lord opened the door to him, he sacrificed that door.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He paid that price to keep the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This shows that we should take care of the inner rest all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we just take care of the outward situation, environment, and circumstances, we are through with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must learn to restrict ourselves to the inner feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The outward situation may be favorable to us, but we should not care for that.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should care for just one thing the inner rest.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not have the rest in our spirit, how can the Lord have rest with us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many times the Lord would allow us to have a choice.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should say, "Lord, my choice is not Your work or the doors opened by You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>My choice is just You."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord may allow us to go through the open door, but if we do, we will lose the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord may open the door for us to preach, but if we go through the door, we will lose the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a deep lesson for us to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not care much for the outward situation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if the outward circumstances are in favor of us, that still is not the green light.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The green light is only the inner rest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rest includes the thought of relief, peace, and ease.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you have no rest, this means that you have no relief, peace, or ease.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may say that it is right for you to stay in a certain place to do a work for the Lord, but deep within you may have no relief, peace, or ease.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Others may not know this, but you do.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may argue that the door has been opened by the Lord for you, but you still have an inner strain and feel bound within.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Your arguing in a vindicating way is according to the consideration in your mind, not according to the registration in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to take care of the inner relief, peace, and ease within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is one basic, spiritual principle in the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are going to grow in life, we should not care for the outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to take care of the inner feeling of whether or not we have the rest deep within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The inner anointing has much to do with this inner feeling of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A sister once gave a testimony of how she had been given a certain amount of money.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>She went to the department store, where she saw a piece of wool on sale.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more she considered the cheap price and the money the Lord had sent her, the more she was convinced that she was right to buy that piece of wool.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But at the same time, she did not have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Still, after much consideration she bought it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Later she came to a meeting and gave this testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She said that after she bought that piece of wool, she could not pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>She felt bound in the spirit because she had lost the inner peace, rest, and ease.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What she had done was not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But she lost the peace until she sold that piece of wool to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the peace came back.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Have we learned the lesson to take care of the inner peace and not the outward circumstances?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul had a door opened to him by the Lord to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was something very good, not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But he did not have the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we do is not a matter of argument, but a matter of the inner rest.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the heavenly court, the more you argue, the more you lose.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord might say to us, "My child, I know that your circumstances and reasons are good, but do you have the rest with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you care for the outward circumstances or the inward rest?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am not in the outward circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am in your spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A wife may say that she is right in her argument with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She may be right, but does she have the peace?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes the brothers may complain about their wives, but do they have the rest?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Would we go along with being right in our complaint, or would we go along with the rest?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To follow the rest you have to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To argue may give you a certain kind of pleasure, but you lose the Lord's presence; you do not have the rest with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am not speaking of the rest in your thinking or of the satisfaction in your emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am speaking of the real ease, relief, peace, and rest in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We all have to learn this deeper lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I encourage you all to follow the Lord in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the way to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Never care for the outward circumstances; always care for the inner rest.</S>
