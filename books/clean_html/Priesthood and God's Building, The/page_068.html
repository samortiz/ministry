<h2 class="head2">Praying without Waiting to Be Led</h2>
<p>Many people think that if they are not led, they do not have to pray; but if we are waiting to be led, we will not have any leading. I hope all the brothers and sisters will see that we need to exercise to pray, and we need to use our spirit when we pray. Instead of waiting to be led, we should actively exercise to pray with our spirit. If we do this, we will progress. Our ears and eyes are well coordinated in their function because we have used our ears to hear and our eyes to see from when we were young. Our eyes and ears are quite skilled because of much exercise. Our spirit needs to be exercised in this same way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying at Every Time and in Every Place</h2>
<p>With the fall of man, the spirit in man ceased to function according to its intended use. Man&rsquo;s sense of intuition and fellowship with God was lost because of sin. When we were saved, our spirit was enlivened, but even though we can exercise our spirit, we do not have much experience of exercising our spirit. Even after some brothers become elders or co-workers, they do not exercise their spirit regularly. This is also true of brothers bearing responsibility in the districts. Our mind may be sharp, our hands and feet may be quick, and our eyes and ears may be keen, but our spirit can still be sluggish. Without exercise, our spirit is the weakest part of our whole being. Hence, we need to pray more. The more we pray, the more we will enter into our spirit. When we first begin to pray, we may not necessarily be in spirit; but as we pray, we will be in spirit more and more. We should pray for big things as well as small things. We should pray at every time, in every place, and for everything; this is more important than setting aside a time for prayer. As we enter into this practice, our spirit will become living and strong.</p>
<p>If we learn to pray in spirit, we will have a strong sense that our opinions are worthless. We will come to despise our opinions and will no longer have a high regard for them. If anyone asks us for our opinion, we will feel that our opinion is meaningless and worthless, and we will not quickly utter it; rather, we will have a strong desire to pray with the person who is asking for our opinion and touch the spirit together with him. How we respond to requests for our opinions is a strong indication of whether we value our opinions more than prayer. In the spirit there are not many opinions and not many things to discuss and debate; the primary sense in our spirit relates to our need to touch God. In the spirit, matters related to biblical exposition, doctrines, opinions, and methods are not central. The only indispensable matter is to touch God.</p>
<p>This is a law. Someone who prays has far fewer opinions than a person who prays very little. A person who has many opinions prays very little. A saint who prays before the Lord does not feel the need to express the opinions that he may have. If a certain matter is mentioned to him, he is often unwilling to discuss it too much, because his way is to pray. As soon as something is mentioned, he will begin to inwardly pray. There are no opinions to discuss and no matters to study and decide; there is only prayer. Such a saint can touch his spirit in any environment and in any situation. Today the building up of the church depends upon saints who are exercised to pray in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ALLOWING SITUATIONS IN THE CHURCH<br />
TO RUN THEIR COURSE BUT LEARNING TO LEAD</h2>
<p>In order to build up the church, we must be in our spirit. As we are learning to turn to our spirit, we also need to learn how to lead others into the exercise of the spirit. All the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in the districts should learn how to lead, and there are many lessons to learn. For example, when a person hears the gospel, we should lead him to pray and receive the Lord. We cannot merely bring a person to hear the gospel and let him just sit and listen. We must learn how to lead him to pray and receive the Lord. If we do not know how to lead him to pray to touch the Lord, he will not be saved.</p>
<p>Flowers often die when I plant them, but they thrive when someone else plants them. Flowers do not bloom when they are in my hand, but they bloom in another&rsquo;s hand. This is a matter of knowledge. We need to learn how to lead others. After a person is saved, baptized, and begins to meet, we should be able to lead him to fellowship with the Lord, to touch the spirit when he reads the Word, to consecrate himself to the Lord, to live a life of consecration, to receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading, and to live in the fellowship. In this way, he will be built in the church.</p>
<p>We should also learn how to lead in the prayer meeting and bread-breaking meeting. For example, we should keep a good record of how many people are in the meeting and how many are absent. We should also find out why people are absent. If it is related to us or to the meeting, we should correct it so that these ones will come back. If it relates to a personal matter, we should help them to resolve it if possible. We should even endeavor to render some special leading and teaching to those who attend the meetings regularly so that their functions may be manifested.</p>
<p>All the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in a district should come together to pray and seek the Lord concerning the brothers and sisters whom they should visit, concerning which co-workers should assist in solving the problems of the saints, and concerning who is able to deal with the needs of the sisters. We should take care of these matters in a thorough way. We must know the condition of the saints, because they are a flock of sheep under our care. A shepherd knows thoroughly the condition of his flock (cf. Jer. 31:10; Ezek. 34:12). We should know which ones urgently need to be flocked together, who needs to be restored, comforted, and helped, and even who has special needs financially. We should handle all these situations in a fine and proper way, looking to the Lord even for the financial help.</p>
<p>If we do not know how to lead the saints, we will do great harm to the church. For example, in one district there are more than eighty sisters and about one hundred brothers. Eight sisters and twenty brothers will come one week for the prayer meeting, and five sisters and thirty brothers will come the next week. No one, however, seems to have any feeling about these fluctuating numbers. Although the attendance at the bread-breaking meeting is about the same from week to week, there is still a gradual decline. Nevertheless, there seems to be no sense of concern about this. This shows that we do not know how to lead.</p>
<p>We should not let matters in the church simply run their course. There is a need for leading. We should consider why the saints are not released in their spirit in the meeting. For example, it may sometimes be related to the singing of the hymns. If this is the case, we should find a way to correct the singing. There is always a way. Even people in the world say, &ldquo;Where there is a will, there is a way.&rdquo; We should surely have a higher expectation, because we have the Lord. We serve the Lord, we worship Him, and we labor in His work. How can He not help us? Singing hymns is not a simple matter. Some hymns should be sung a little faster; if we sing them too slowly, our spirit will become sluggish. If the spirits of the saints are not released, the meeting cannot go on. Furthermore, we need to find out why many saints do not come to the prayer meeting. We must study the situation so that we can render a certain amount of leading to them.</p>
<p>God created us as living human beings with a spirit. Since we are human, we have to take care of our human conduct; for this we need to have much learning and teaching. In 2 Timothy 3:14, Paul says, &ldquo;Continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them,&rdquo; and in 2:2 he says, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; After Timothy heard Paul&rsquo;s teachings, he was exhorted by Paul to commit these teachings, that is, to teach Paul&rsquo;s teachings, to those who were competent to teach others. We should learn, and we should teach others. Our teaching is our leading. The brothers and sisters have a heart and love for the Lord, and they are willing to enlarge His kingdom and spread the gospel so that the Lord may deliver more people, gain more glory, and build up the church in a real way.</p>
<p>We must learn every day because there is no time for us to learn later; we must learn while doing. If we pay special attention to exercising our spirit, we can be learning and leading at the same time, and the church will have a way to be built up. If, however, we neglect the spirit and allow the meetings to just run their course, the building up of the church will be nothing more than empty talk. On one hand, all the saints must be in the spirit, and on the other hand, the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in the districts must endeavor to learn. We can lead others only with what we have learned. All the matters related to service require learning because they cannot be carried out by our natural ability. Without learning spiritual lessons, we will not be able to build up the church, because our natural ability has no place in the building. We cannot serve with our natural ability, thinking that it is enough to follow the Lord according to our own ideas. Since we love the Lord, we have to learn how to lead the brothers and sisters in the meetings and how to care for them.</p>
<p>God in His mercy has placed us in the church in a certain place to care for the brothers and sisters; therefore, we have to bear this responsibility. We should diligently learn and continually learn; the more we learn, the more we will be able to teach others and lead others. The building of the church depends on the exercise of the spirit by all the saints, and it depends on the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in the districts to endeavor to learn and to endeavor to lead. If this is our situation, the road ahead in regard to the building will be open before us and promising.</p>
