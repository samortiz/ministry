<p>Ephesians 3 speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts. In order to experience Christ, He must make His home in our hearts. We must give Him the freedom to make His home in our hearts, that is, to settle down in us. Then we will experience and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>There are three crucial items in chapter 4: being mingled with the Triune God, growing with the growth of Christ, and being renewed by accepting Christ as our person. Every saint in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery should arrive at a full-grown man by being mingled with the Triune God, grow up into Christ the Head in all things, and grow unto the building up of the Body (vv. 4-6, 13, 15-16). When we have these experiences, we will be renewed and transformed, and we will put off the old man and put on the new man, which is the church. We also will experience Christ as our person and live by Him, not by ourselves. Formerly, our self was our person, but our person will change. When we accept Christ as our person, we become the one new man.</p>
<p>These four items&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s making His home in our hearts and our being mingled with the Triune God, growing with the growth of Christ, and being renewed by accepting Christ as our person&mdash;are crucial. However, they have been neglected and lost in Christianity. These items are not taught in Christianity, nor can they be found in any Christian publication. Even though these four items are subjective and deep, we need to know and experience them in order to have the proper church life.</p>
<p>Paul knew the secret of experiencing these four items. If we want to experience Christ making His home in our hearts and our being mingled with the Triune God, growing in life, and being renewed by taking Christ as our person, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s word. If we do not eat His Word daily by pray-reading with our spirit, these items will not be our experience. The Christ who is making His home in our hearts, who gives us the growth in life, and who is our person is in the Word, and the Triune God is in the Word. Therefore, we must receive the Lord&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>Dietitians say that the human body needs many nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and vitamins. These nutrients are in our food. Physical food signifies the Bible, the Word of God. The Bible contains various spiritual nutrients. If we do not eat the Word, we will be malnourished. Many Christians are malnourished. They have the Bible, but it is on a bookshelf or in a drawer. They have food in their hands, but they do not cook it, nor do they eat it. As a result, they are malnourished.</p>
<p>Many young people in the United States are lazy and loose; they like to wake up late in the morning. They have to be at work by eight o&rsquo;clock, but they sleep until a quarter to eight. Hence, they do not have time to prepare breakfast; instead, they rush to work and buy a doughnut on their way. Furthermore, they do not take the time to eat a proper lunch; they buy a hamburger. As a result of such a poor diet, many young people are malnourished and weak and lack energy.</p>
<p>We must take the time to eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word daily. If we eat properly, we will be nourished. This spiritual nourishment contains living water that washes us and removes negative things from our spiritual life, just as the food we eat washes and nourishes us. I am healthy because I eat properly. Proper food strengthens us, cleanses our blood, and unclogs our blood vessels. Food nourishes us, washes us, and protects us from germs. This also applies to spiritual food&mdash;the Word of God. We need to pray-read God&rsquo;s Word with our spirit so that we may be nourished and washed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
NOURISHING AND CHERISHING MAN</h2>
<p>There are two additional precious words in chapter 5: <em>nourishes</em> and <em>cherishes</em> (v. 29). To nourish is to supply a person with food so that he receives nourishment. When we pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we receive spiritual food, which not only washes us but also nourishes us. The Lord&rsquo;s Word also supplies and cherishes us. To cherish is to nurse a child just as a mother holds and feeds her child in her bosom. A child in his mother&rsquo;s bosom is nourished and protected and also enjoys rest, warmth, and comfort. This is to cherish.</p>
<p>When we pray-read the Word, we have the sense within that we are in the Lord&rsquo;s bosom; we are filled with a gentle and intimate sense. Here we are enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s protection, comfort, and warmth while being nourished and cherished in His bosom. If we enjoy Christ in such a way, we will not grow old. Rather, we will be renewed daily; we will be rejuvenated, fresh, green, and tender. Then the church will not have spots, wrinkles, or blemishes but will be holy and glorious. This is the church that the Lord desires.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
