   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE GOD'S PLAN AND GOD'S REST Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26 2:3; 2:18-24; Eph 5:22-32; Rev 12; 21:1 22:5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Four women are mentioned in these four passages of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Genesis 2 the woman is Eve; in Ephesians 5 she is the church; in Revelation 12 she is the woman seen in the vision; and in Revelation 21 she is the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May God grant us light to see how these four women are related to one another and to His eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we may see the position the church occupies and the responsibility she bears in this plan and how the overcomers of God will accomplish His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>GOD'S PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why did God create man?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What was His purpose in creating man?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God has given us the answer to these questions in Genesis 1:26 and 27.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These two verses are of great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They reveal to us that God's creation of man was indeed an exceedingly special one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before God created man, He said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was God's plan in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"God said, Let us..."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This speaks of the kind of man God wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, God was designing a "model" for the man He was to create.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 27 reveals God's creation of man: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 28 says, "God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From these verses we see the man that God desired.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God desired a ruling man, a man who would rule upon this earth; then He would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How did God create man?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He created man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God wanted a man like Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is very evident then that man's position in God's creation is entirely unique, for among all of God's creatures man alone was created in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The man that God's heart was set upon was completely different from all other created beings; he was a man in His own image.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We notice here something quite remarkable.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness..."; but verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verse 26 the pronoun "our" is plural, but in verse 27 "his" is singular.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the conference of the Godhead, verse 26 says, "Let us make man in our image"; therefore, according to grammar, verse 27 should say, "So God created man in their own image."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But strangely, verse 27 says, "So God created man in his own image."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How can we explain this?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is because there are three in the Godhead the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet only one has the image in the Godhead the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the Godhead was designing man's creation, the Bible indicates that man would be made in "our" image since They are one, "our image" was mentioned ; but when the Godhead was in the actual process of making man, the Bible says that man was made in "his" image.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"His" denotes the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From this we ascertain that Adam was made in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Adam did not precede the Lord Jesus; the Lord Jesus preceded him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When God created Adam, He created him in the image of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is for this reason it says "in his image" rather than "in their image."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's purpose is to gain a group of people who are like His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we read Romans 8:29 we find God's purpose: "Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God desires to have many sons, and God desires all these sons to be like that one Son of His.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then His Son will no more be the only Begotten, but the Firstborn among many brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's desire is to gain such a group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we see this, we will realize the preciousness of man, and we will rejoice whenever man is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How God values man!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even He Himself became a man!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's plan is to gain man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When man is gained by God, God's plan is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is by man that God's plan is fulfilled, and through man His own need is met.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What, then, does God require from the man whom He created?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is that man should rule.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God created man, He did not predestine man to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man's fall is in chapter three of Genesis, not chapter one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In God's plan to create man, He did not predestine man to sin, neither did He foreordain redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are not minimizing the importance of redemption, but only saying that redemption was not foreordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If it were, then man would have to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God did not foreordain this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In God's plan to create man, man was ordained to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is revealed to us in Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Here God unveils to us His desire and tells us the secret of His plan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is God's purpose in creating man.</S>
