   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOT NEEDING TO ANALYZE WHETHER OUR RECEIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IS ACCORDING TO KNOWLEDGE OR THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: Is there a distinction between receiving that is according to knowledge and receiving that is according to the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Answer: Concerning the declaration of Japan s surrender, was there a distinction between receiving this news as knowledge and receiving it by the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When people heard of Japan s declaration of surrender, did anyone wonder whether he received the news as knowledge or in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have these kinds of questions in our mind because we have not seen the Lord s all-inclusive death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, we ask ourselves: Is this subjective or objective?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is this knowledge or the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Seeing is seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Japan s surrendering simply meant Japan s surrendering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ s death simply means that Christ died.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His death which terminated all things simply means Christ s death terminated all things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The simpler we are when we apply these matters in our experience, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is no need to analyze, because we cannot enter the spirit by analysis.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fact that Christ died means that Christ died; that all things were terminated on the cross means that all things were terminated on the cross; that we died in Him means that we died in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All analyses come from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>TOUCHING GOD DEPENDING ON HIS MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND OUR STOPPING DISTRACTING THOUGHTS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Question: Why is it that spiritual matters sometimes seem so real and at other times so distant from us?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Answer: This is exactly right.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Spiritual matters can be very near, as near as in your mouth and in your heart Rom 10:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They can also seem so distant that they are beyond our reach our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This same principle applies to hearing the gospel and receiving salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One person may receive the gospel immediately upon hearing it the first time, whereas another person may not receive the gospel after hearing it numerous times.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Suppose there are two brothers, and the younger one receives the gospel, but the older one does not.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The older brother may ask the younger, How did you receive the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The younger brother may reply, I simply received it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The older brother says that it is difficult to receive the gospel, but at the same time the younger brother says that it is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This shows that God will have mercy on whomever He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whomever He will have compassion Rom 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our salvation is truly a matter of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are saved because God showed us mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is difficult for God to work in a person who does not think clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is strange, however, that some people s minds are clear when we speak concerning subjects such as engineering, machinery, and economics.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when we speak to them concerning God s salvation, no matter how hard we try, we cannot get through with them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are easily distracted in their thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is truly a matter of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What can we do to receive God s mercy?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we want to give a lofty answer, we can say, If God will have mercy on me, I will be shown mercy; if God will not have mercy on me, I will still ask Him for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to be humble to say, O God, enable me to see.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Let me see today; if not today, then let me see tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, our eagerness to see is often a hindrance to seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet at the same time a lack of eagerness to see can also be an obstacle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, when the apostle Paul wrote Ephesians, he prayed for the saints, That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul s responsibility was to write the Epistle, but whether or not the saints would know the Lord Jesus depended on God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, whenever I give a message such as this, I am reluctant to exhort or incite people with words; by the Lord s mercy I would like to unveil this mystery so that perhaps some could hear and receive mercy to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Similarly, when we preach the gospel, we do not know who will be shown mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In this matter we can do nothing to help.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Man s salvation is of God s mercy; no one can help in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may think that we are very capable, but have we gained anything?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have preached the gospel, but our number has not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have not gained what we thought we were capable of gaining.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need the light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the book of Job, God did not speak until Job s friends had finished their speaking 38:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When man stops speaking, the light comes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are often bothered if we do not do something for the Lord, but even when we do, we often have no impact.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is because we do not have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God wants simplicity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Our words and thoughts need to be purified; they need the shining of God s light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The most successful people in the world are the simplest people.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the same in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must stop our distracting thoughts and worship before the Lord, saying, Lord, You are the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whether or not I see, You are still the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then our problem will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must be able to stop and not try to analyze whether something is this way or that way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we think that we can find a solution by our analysis, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to learn to be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since the Lord has said so, we should simply stop and receive.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In response some might ask, What if I receive it but nothing happens?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This continual asking of questions is like being presented with food but still asking, Is there bacteria in the food?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What if I eat it and have a stomachache?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Should I see a doctor?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What if the doctor is inexperienced?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Questions like these can be endless.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They may have heard the words of the faith many years ago, but in their mind they have one question after another.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, they can neither touch nor receive the reality in God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to stop our distracting mind, stop wandering in our mind, stop all our questions, and simply come back to God s Word to allow the light in God s Word to shine on us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once we have the light and have seen the light, our being will spontaneously be terminated.</S>
