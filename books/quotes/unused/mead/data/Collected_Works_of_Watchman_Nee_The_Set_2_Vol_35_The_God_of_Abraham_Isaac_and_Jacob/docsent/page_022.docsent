   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE ABRAHAM AND HIS SON 2 Scripture Reading: Gen 16:16 18; 20:1-2, 10-13, 17-18; 21:1-3, 10; Col 2:11; Phil 3:3 Abraham's Circumcision</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God promised Abraham a son, but Abraham did not wait on God for his son; he married a concubine and gave birth to a son Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After he begot Ishmael, there was a thirteen-year period in which God did not speak to him Gen 16:16 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although he begot a son, he wasted thirteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the experience of many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we act according to the flesh, God puts us aside and allows us to eat the fruit of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God's eyes that period of time is a total waste.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After Abraham begot Ishmael, during the long period of thirteen years, there was no peace in his family.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, the Bible does not show us that Abraham had any regret.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the contrary, he treasured Ishmael very much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We can see this from his word to the Lord: "O that Ishmael might live before thee!"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>17:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although chapter fifteen tells us that he believed, there does not seem to have been too much pursuing on his part.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Day after day, he still took satisfaction in Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to our thought, if a man has been walking according to the flesh for thirteen years and still has no feeling of guilt, there must not be much hope for him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we must remember that Abraham was called by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God had a purpose in him which He had to fulfill; He could not give him up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although he backslid for thirteen years and although God did not speak to him during all that time, He was working all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God does not give up those whom He has chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If He wants to gain a person, that person cannot escape His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even though Abraham had failed, God still came and looked for him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have to realize that no fleshly pursuit, struggle, fretting, or unrest will bring us forward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should learn to commit ourselves to the hand of the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He will lead us as He sees fit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God Making a Covenant with Abraham</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After thirteen years, Abraham was ninety-nine years of age and was becoming old.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He considered his own body as being already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even if he wanted to have a son, he could no longer do it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then God appeared to him and said, "I am the Almighty God" 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the first time that God revealed His name as "the Almighty God."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The name Almighty God in the original language can be translated as "all-sufficient God."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After God revealed this name to him, He put a demand on him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Walk before me, and be thou perfect."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although Abraham had believed that God is powerful, he might not have believed that God is all-sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was why he tried to do things by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God showed him that if he believed in God as the all-sufficient One, he had to walk before Him as a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being perfect is being pure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God required Abraham to be pure and without any mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After God showed this to Abraham, He said, "I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will multiply thee exceedingly....My covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made thee....And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>2-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wanted to gain a people through Abraham, and God wanted to be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What kind of a standing should Abraham and God's people take before they can become His people?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God said, "This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be circumcised" v. 10 . In other words, God wants a people, yet they must not have any fleshly activity, power, or strength.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Who then are the people of God?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are those who have been circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Circumcision is the mark of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Those who were eight days old, whether they were born in the house or bought with money of any stranger had to be circumcised v. 12 . It was not enough to be born, and it was not enough to be bought.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One had to be circumcised as well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are all born of God and bought by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As far as redemption is concerned, we were bought by God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As far as life is concerned, we were born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if we are not circumcised, we will have no part in the testimony of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God told Abraham, "The uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people" v. 14 . Those who were not circumcised were to be cut off from among God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This has to do with the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It means that those who are not circumcised cannot be vessels for God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A man may be redeemed and have life, but if he is not circumcised, and if he does not know the flesh-dealing cross, he cannot be of God's people; he still has to be cut off from the people.</S>
