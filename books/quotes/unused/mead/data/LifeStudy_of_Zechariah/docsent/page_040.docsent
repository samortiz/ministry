   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE PROPHECY CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE LORD'S LOVING VISITATION TO ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The prophecy in chapter ten of Zechariah concerns the Lord's loving visitation to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we will see, this loving visitation is actually Christ's coming to Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A. The Lord Encouraging</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>the Children of Israel to Seek More Blessings</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Ask rain of Jehovah / At the time of spring rain, / Of Jehovah who makes the lightning, / And He will give them showers of rain, / To everyone herbage in the field" v. 1 . The word rain here signifies blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To ask for more rain is to seek more blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, in this verse the Lord is encouraging the children of Israel to seek more blessings while He would be favorable to them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>While the Lord is so favorable to us, we should ask Him to send us even more favor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since God is giving us showers of rain, we should ask Him for more rain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that we all need to pray for the Lord's abundant blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. The Lord Punishing the False Shepherds</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verses 2 and 3a say, "The teraphim have spoken vanity, / And the diviners have seen a lie / And have spoken false dreams; they comforted in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ Therefore the people have wandered like sheep; / They are afflicted because there is no shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>/ My anger is kindled against the shepherds, / And I will punish the male goats."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Among the Jews in the ancient time, many possessed teraphim, which were images or false gods kept in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All those false gods and all the diviners spoke vanity and false dreams; they comforted in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the people wandered like sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were afflicted because there was no shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 3 tells us that the Lord's anger was kindled against the shepherds and that He would punish the male goats.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The shepherds here are the male goats.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The proper shepherds are the prophets, the proper ones who speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we have a wonderful practice in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We encourage every saint to prophesy; we make every saint a prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the Lord's move among His people today, the most important thing is to speak for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul encouraged all the saints to prophesy 1 Cor 14:1, 24, 31, 39a .</S>
