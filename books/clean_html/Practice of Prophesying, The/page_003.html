<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>To Foretell&#151;to Predict</H2><P>To prophesy is also to foretell, to tell beforehand, to predict. In the Old Testament, Isaiah, with sixty-six chapters, and Jeremiah, with fifty-two chapters, are two long books of prophecy. However, only a small percentage of these two books consists of foretelling. Most of the chapters consist of speaking for God and speaking forth God. With other prophetic books it is the same. There are some foretellings in the book of Zechariah, but it contains mainly the speaking forth of Christ. In the writings of Paul, there are some foretellings. Most of Paul's writings consist of speaking for God and speaking forth God, that is, speaking to dispense God and Christ into the believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>In 1 Corinthians 14,<br>Foretelling Not Being Included</H2><P>In 1 Corinthians 14, to prophesy does not include to foretell. This is proved by verses 3 and 24. Verse 3 says, "But he who prophesies speaks to men building up and encouragement and consolation" (lit.). Building up, encouragement, and consolation are not predictions. Building up is for the church, encouragement is for the work, and consolation is for our daily life. For the church we need the building up, for the work we need the encouragement, and for our daily life we need consolation. These definitely are not predictions.</P><P>Verse 24 says, "But if all prophesy and some unbeliever or unlearned person enters, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all." In this verse to prophesy is not to foretell, but to convict and judge people, to make their situation clear to them. When an unbeliever or unlearned person comes into a meeting, he may be confused, mistakenly thinking that he is right with God; but by listening to the prophesying, he is made clear. The prophesying convicts and judges him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROPHESYING IN THE WAY<br>OF 1 CORINTHIANS 14 BEING CARRIED OUT<br>IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS AND BEING<br>FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Prophesying in the way of 1 Corinthians 14 is carried out in the church meetings (vv. 23-24). Verse 23 says, "If therefore the whole church comes together in one place..." This refers to a church meeting, not a home meeting or a small group meeting. Moreover, the prophesying in the way of 1 Corinthians 14 is for the building up of the church (vv. 4-5). According to our experience and observation, the best way to build the church is to prophesy, that is, to speak for Christ and to speak forth Christ, ministering and dispensing Christ into people. For one man to speak while all the others listen is a form of prophesying, but it is carried out in a wrong way. The proper prophesying should be carried out by each attendant in the church meetings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PROPHESYING IN THE WAY OF 1 CORINTHIANS 14<br>CAUSING A SEEKING ONE TO EXCEL<br>TO THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>Prophesying in the way of 1 Corinthians 14 causes a seeking one to excel to the building up of the church. Verse 12 says, "So also you, since you are zealots of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the building up of the church" (lit.). It is good to speak in tongues, but it is not excelling. However, for one to give a short message as a prophecy is excelling. To prophesy is the highest gift, causing the speaker to excel. We must learn to speak not only so that we can excel, but also so that the church can be built up.</P>
