WHERE CHRIST IS ON THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Christ promised that He will be present wherever there is a meeting of the church (Matt. 18:20). He also promised that He would be with the church all the days until the consummation of the age (28:20). The church should always give people the sense of Christ&rsquo;s presence. The church has a problem if it causes people to sense zeal, excitement, or strength but not the presence of Christ. A church that fails to give people the sense of Christ&rsquo;s presence has lost the nature of Christ and lacks Christ.</p>
<p>A church that is normal must be full of Christ, full of the Spirit of Christ, and full of the presence of Christ. Those who are in the meetings of such a church will sense not only zeal, excitement, love, and faith but also something mysterious; they will sense Christ&rsquo;s presence. Those whose hearts are darkened will be enlightened, those who have no way to proceed will find a way, those who are feeble-hearted will find a solid standing, and those who are heavily burdened will have their burdens removed. Those who attend a meeting of the church may forget what they heard, but something mysterious will be added to them because Someone is present with them. Such experiences demonstrate that the church is full of Christ and is filled with the operation of the Spirit. When people touch the church, they touch Christ, and when they touch the Spirit and reality of the church, they also touch Christ. The church on earth is the place where Christ is, because the church is Christ on the earth today. Hence, if we are in the church, Christ must be here. We must not represent anything other than Christ, and we must not be anything other than Christ. We should be the reality of Christ for people to sense and to touch Him, His life, and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GROWTH OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since the church is the Body of Christ, His embodiment, the growth of the church should be the growth of Christ. The growth of the church is not determined by an increase in its strengths or merits but by the increase of Christ. The measure of the growth of the church is not determined by an increase in numbers but by the increase of Christ. God does not measure the church by any criterion or ruler other than Christ. His desire is for Christ to increase and grow in the church and for Christ to become the content and element of the church so that the church would arrive &ldquo;at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:13). Only the increase of Christ is the growth of the church; only the increase of the measure of the stature of Christ is the growth of the church.</p>
<p>I would ask the saints in all the localities to consider whether they have had an increase of the element of Christ in the past two years. Has there been an increase of the measure of the stature of Christ? I am not asking whether we have had an increase in love, whether our zeal has been intensified, or whether we have had an increase in numbers. My question is, &ldquo;Has the element of Christ increased among us? Has the measure of the stature of Christ increased?&rdquo; This is what God is after. This is His focus. God&rsquo;s work has been to cause the measure of the stature of Christ to increase in the church. God is expecting the church to grow to the full measure of the stature of Christ, because God&rsquo;s desire is for the church to be the Body of Christ, His fullness. Only the element of Christ can be the element of the church, and only the growth of Christ is the growth of the church. Only Christ is the reality of the church. Everything related to the church should be Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
