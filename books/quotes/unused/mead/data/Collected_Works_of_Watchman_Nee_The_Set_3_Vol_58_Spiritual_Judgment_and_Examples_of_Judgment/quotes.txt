[2]  The judgment that we are speaking of today is not the kind of judgment carried out in the law courts.
[3]  The first thing we have to realize is that unless we know how to judge and discern, we will face difficulties and will be easily deceived in our service to the Lord.
[4]  Third, there is a difference between being spiritual and mental.
[5]  Many spiritual things are in man's spirit as well as in his mind.
[6]  It is not easy to know whether a man is in the spirit or in the mind simply by the words he says or the terms he uses.
[7]  Two men can use the same words and terms, but their source is different.
[8]  In judging others, there is a basic qualification we first must be judged thoroughly by God.
[9]  I cannot pass on a method of judging others to you.
[10]  The only thing I can say is that our knowledge of others is based on our knowledge of ourselves.
[11]  If we do not know ourselves, we cannot know others.
[12]  If we are thoroughly judged by God, we will easily know the brothers and sisters when we see them.
[13]  In the last chapter we saw the importance of judgment.
[14]  In this chapter we will consider the importance of exercising our spiritual senses.
[15]  In contacting others, we have to give them a chance to speak, and we have to learn to discern with our spirit.
[16]  If a man does not open his mouth, it is hard to know him.
[17]  When a man opens his mouth, his spirit is exposed; others will know whether or not he has a right spirit.
[18]  When the spirit is exposed, the inner condition of a man is also exposed.
[19]  In listening to someone, the first thing we have to find is his strong spot.
[20]  We have to ask, "What kind of impression do I have of this man?
[21]  In judging a man, we have to know whether there is any kind of pretension in him.
[22]  It is difficult for a pretentious person to grow in the Lord.
[23]  He needs to experience a double breaking from the Lord.
[24]  Let us turn our attention now to a basic question: How do we touch others' spirit with our spirit, and how do we judge men with our spirit?
[25]  In order for us to be able to judge men, our outer man must be broken.
[26]  CHAPTER THREE SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT 3 THE BASIS OF DIAGNOSIS AND JUDGMENT Date:October 1, 1948
[27]  We have seen the principles of judging men and also discussed the ways to identify and touch men's condition with our spirit.
[28]  We also realize that there is a need for us to go through dealings before the Lord.
[29]  In this chapter we will consider two additional matters.
[30]  When we try to touch others' condition with our spirit, we may touch their words and spirit.
[31]  There is one basic condition for knowing men's problems or diagnosing their illnesses: We must understand that the purpose of our discernment and judgment is not for checking others out.
[32]  A proper Christian should not desire to know about others.
[33]  Only abnormal Christians would want to pry into others' business.
[34]  Although we need to know the condition of the brothers, we are not motivated by curiosity.
[35]  After we have studied the condition of the brothers and sisters and have discovered their problems, we can start to diagnose their situation.
[36]  We can begin talking to them and leading them on the way to deliverance and healing.
[37]  It is easy to speak about this process, but when we are confronted with practical problems, we have to be able to open others' eyes.
[38]  There are mainly three kinds of people with problems.
[39]  We can point out their problems while we are alone with them.
[40]  After I was saved, I loved to read the Bible and pray.
[41]  Brother, you have to take care of two things.
[42]  Even when you do not find any interest in your work, you still have to go on.
[43]  In my youth I studied in a non-Christian school.
[44]  I was saved through reading about the Lord's love in the four Gospels.
[45]  I broke the Bible into small sections and put them in my pocket so that I could carry it with me easily.
[46]  When I was a baby, I received the rite of sprinkling.
[47]  When I was a teen-ager, I received confirmation and became a regular member of the church, eligible to partake of the holy communion.
[48]  It is, of course, good to experience personal dealings.
[49]  But if you spend all your time and thoughts on this matter, you will not have enough time to deal with others, and the work will suffer.
[50]  I found God's light through defeat and failure, and this light led me to this way.
[51]  In taking this way, I have often tried to deal with myself.
[52]  Why is it that I cannot concentrate my thoughts?
[53]  I like to read spiritual books, but it is difficult for me to concentrate my thoughts.
[54]  As I fellowshipped with Brother Nee more and more, I found life and life supply in his speaking.
[55]  At the age of seventeen I heard the gospel and knew that I was a sinner destined for hell.
[56]  I called on the Lord's name and prayed to Him.
[57]  When I was twenty-one years old, I had a spiritual turn, and I consecrated myself to the Lord.
[58]  After I was saved I became very hungry for God's word.
[59]  But I lived a vacillating and unsteady life for about half a year.
[60]  Concerning the second question, my answer is that you can pray for a love for sinners' souls.
[61]  First, you have to see the pitiful condition of a sinner.
[62]  This will stir up your love for him and give you an earnest sense of responsibility which can never be shaken off.
[63]  On the one hand, you can ask God to give you a love for sinners' souls.
[64]  I am willing to expose myself fully to the judgment of the church.
[65]  In my family I was the only daughter, and I have been loved by everyone since my youth.
[66]  This is the reason I am so proud of myself and not afraid of others.
[67]  When I was in a gospel meeting, I heard a line of a song: "While others have received it, do not pass me by."
[68]  I was touched by that word and prayed to God to save me.
[69]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 9 Date:July 1, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER S. S.
[70]  But at that time I did not know what faith was and what salvation meant.
[71]  After a while I became cold once again and even began to doubt my salvation.
[72]  I was stirred up by others' testimonies when they testified of their fellowship with the Lord, but I myself did not have such fellowship.
[73]  My colleagues pleaded with me to believe in the Lord.
[74]  I agreed with the Lord's teachings, but I was not convinced by those who believed in such teachings.
[75]  I was saved in 1935 despite opposition from my parents.
[76]  In 1936 I turned to the local church and enjoyed the sweetness of the Word.
[77]  I consecrated myself to the Lord and became very desirous of the messages.
[78]  That year I quit my job at the hospital and returned to my village to preach the gospel.
[79]  Every time others asked whether I had sinned, I would answer proudly that I had never sinned.
[80]  But a question remained in me: "What if I have sinned?"
[81]  My older sister was the first in my family to believe in the Lord.
[82]  Later I went and listened to the gospel myself and believed in the Lord that first day.
[83]  I will mention another important matter: We need light to bring us to death.
[84]  If we have not received scorching light, we should ask for it.
[85]  It is true that we are weak enough, but when light comes, it makes us even weaker.
[86]  After I became a Christian my parents began to persecute me.
[87]  My father said that I could not remain in the house because my whole family was in turmoil because of me.
[88]  I was sent to a seminary in Nanking and studied there for over three years.
[89]  Second, God wants you to live solely by faith.
[90]  When the outer man no longer supports the inner man or replaces it, our emotion, mind, and will recede to the background one by one.
[91]  Then God will teach us the lesson of faith.
[92]  We will believe that God's throne remains in heaven, that there is still authority in the Lord Jesus' name, that God's glory is above everything, that His victory cannot be overturned, that the Lord's resurrection has transcended over all, that Satan has been defeated, etc. On our side, our feelings and thoughts change.
[93]  I was born into a non-Christian family, and it was difficult for me to be saved.
[94]  While I was in my office one day, I asked out of curiosity if there was ever a man on earth who never lied.
[95]  My boss told me that only Christians do not lie.
[96]  At the age of sixteen I began to turn against all religions.
[97]  Only one third of Charles Stanley's lungs function, yet he is constantly engaged in open-air evangelism.
[98]  The audience can range in number from two or three thousand to six or seven thousand.
[99]  He has been preaching this way for thirty years.
[100]  He has God's word, and there is no problem for him to work this way.
[101]  But if one does not have God's word, such a thing would be suicide.
[102]  When I am sick and I know that God wants to heal me with His word, I only need to deal with His word; I do not have to deal with the sickness itself.
[103]  If God says that I will be healed, I only need to focus on God's healing; His word will stop my illness.
[104]  At the age of five or six, I had a consciousness of God's presence.
[105]  I have seen that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and is made for prayer.
[106]  This is the reason I spend a few hours every day praying.
[107]  Brother Nee returned from England in 1939 and spoke about God's purpose in creating man.
[108]  I saw that anything that is not of Christ, no matter how good it may be, should be condemned.
[109]  One day your eyes will be opened, and you will see that weakness is not a hindrance to, but a manifestation of, God's power.
[110]  From that day forward, you will be able to boast and glory in your weakness.
[111]  Many people can memorize the words: "I boast in nothing of my own.
[112]  I only boast in my own weakness, that the power of Christ may overshadow me."
[113]  In 1932 I was married, and that winter I took hospitality with a friend who talked to me about the Lord many times.
[114]  I argued with her often, yet I realized that many believers have a change in their living.
[115]  Later I was touched by Brother Witness Lee when he preached on grace and truth, and I believed in the Lord.
[116]  I studied in a non-Christian school and joined my classmates and teachers in opposing Christ.
[117]  In 1934 I attended an evangelistic meeting and was touched to accept the Lord one night.
[118]  After I believed in the Lord, I prayed with tears for my unbelieving family.
[119]  At the age of eight or nine I began to love chanting, and at the age of ten I began to listen to Buddhist sermons in the temple.
[120]  I knew that the world is evil, and I desired to reach Nirvana and to save all beings.
[121]  Christianity is not about changing the mind or the emotion; it has to do with the purifying of the spirit.
[122]  A naughty boy may be severely punished by his father.
[123]  After I was saved, I studied the Bible but did not understand very much.
[124]  Later I read 1 Peter 4, and I was touched by it.
[125]  I was quite seeking in the local church and often experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in my prayer.
[126]  When I was young, my village had over ten workers of the Lord.
[127]  I was baptized at the age of eighteen and worked as a teacher for a girls' elementary school under the China Inland Mission.
[128]  I was saved in a clear way in a prayer meeting.
[129]  I was very happy about my salvation, yet I suffered persecution from others.
[130]  Although I suffered outwardly, I was still rejoicing inwardly.
[131]  The Lord wanted me to work in the kitchen, but I felt that I was behind in my spirituality, and I wanted to serve the Lord in a spiritual way like other sisters.
[132]  I was saved in a clear way through Brother Nee's preaching on Ephesians 2:8.
[133]  After this, my spiritual life took a big turn.
[134]  I returned to my village to preach the gospel to my grandmother, mother, and brother.
[135]  First, my mother heard the gospel and believed in the Lord.
[136]  Then, I was saved through a sister who preached John 3:16 to me.
[137]  After I read them, I realized that denominationalism is wrong, and I left the Baptist Church.
[138]  I grew up in a China Inland Mission Church.
[139]  Someone preached the gospel to me and told me that my sins would be forgiven if I believed in the Lord.
[140]  I secretly accepted the Lord, and peace filled my heart.
[141]  Later I bought a small Bible and began to read it by myself.
[142]  I did not know whether I should be a preacher for the sake of making a living or whether I should make my preaching my living.
[143]  CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 28 Date:July 31, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER H. B.
[144]  When I was young I suffered from pneumonia in both my lungs.
[145]  I looked to the Lord and at the same time took medicine for my healing.
[146]  Our brother's testimony shows us that he suffered through his father's death and the loss of family fortune.
[147]  If our brother considers all these to be crosses from God and accepts them willingly, they will become life to him.
[148]  If your experience is merely a shame to you, this shame will bring in death.
[149]  But if it is a cross which you take up for the Lord, the mark which is left behind will be life to you.
[150]  If I turn my left cheek to you, considering it God's sovereignty for me to suffer, and I suffer willingly, I have peace and joy in my heart.
[151]  I was not contaminated too much by the world or sins.
[152]  At the age of about seventeen I accepted the Lord and was baptized in a China Inland Mission Church.
[153]  Once I read The Christian published by Brother Nee, and I was moved to leave the C.I.M. Those in the denomination thought that we were creating a division.
[154]  Before I was saved in 1933, I was addicted to novels and drama.
[155]  Later I borrowed some spiritual books from a sister and attended prayer meetings regularly.
[156]  I am an optimistic person and I like to laugh and joke.
[157]  In the past I was an agnostic, believing in nothing at all.
[158]  One day I asked myself, "Should I reject everything unreasonably?
[159]  Once in my distress I called on the name of the Lord Jesus and vented my sadness.
[160]  I was saved in 1938, but I touched the Lord's way only five years ago.
[161]  In the past my life was caught up with people in military-political circles.
[162]  One day I read in Matthew 7 about entering the narrow gate and taking the constricted way.
[163]  I saw that the Lord is my Friend and my world.
[164]  CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 33 Date:August 9, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER M. A.
[165]  At the age of eighteen I called on the name of the Lord and was saved.
[166]  A pastor told me that if I sinned again, I would be crucifying the Lord again.
[167]  Because of this I would cry every time I sinned again.
[168]  My mother thought that I had lost my mind.
[169]  I tried to commit suicide by hanging myself a few times because I could not stand the constant pressure.
[170]  I became very pessimistic and thought of becoming a monk.
[171]  First, I became a vegetarian, and then I joined a monastery.
[172]  I graduated from a seminary in 1928 and knew that it was wrong to be a salaried worker.
[173]  Later the Lord led me to live by faith.
[174]  One day I read an open letter by Brother Nee which said that it is not enough merely to observe outward signs like baptism, the breaking of bread, head covering, and leaving the denominations.
[175]  Once I heard the gospel and was touched to believe in the Lord Jesus.
[176]  Later I became quite effective in working for the Lord.
[177]  I thought, however, that this was due to my ability.
[178]  In my youth I considered Christianity to be a cultural invasion by the Western world.
[179]  At the age of sixteen I went to Shanghai to study and began to attend the Apostolic Faith Church.
[180]  There I saw many people healed of their sicknesses, and demons were cast out.
[181]  In 1925 I was baptized, but I did not know that I was saved.
[182]  I was saved in 1925 at the Bible school established by Sister Dora Yu in Jiang-Wan, Shanghai.
[183]  My mother and husband passed away, and I lost all interest in the world.
[184]  Two years later I returned to Canton and began meeting at a sister's house.
[185]  Once I met Brother Nee's mother, who told me the truth concerning the church.
[186]  I was born into a family steeped in Buddhism and Confucianism.
[187]  When I attended school at a denominational parochial school, I heard the Lord's gospel and immediately accepted Him.
[188]  I loved to subscribe to spiritual publications, in particular those put out by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room.
[189]  I had thought about going into a seminary, but when I met Brother Nee, he told me that very few great servants of the Lord had passed through seminaries.
[190]  I accepted the Lord in the midst of a sickness in 1932.
[191]  The next year my mother consecrated me to be a preacher.
[192]  I dropped many of my bad habits after I believed in the Lord.
[193]  After I read them, however, I would feel condemned for not being able to practice what I read.
[194]  Later I got a word: "Whereunto we have attained, by the same rule let us walk," and I was at peace.
[195]  My mother was a vegetarian for over thirty years.
[196]  Later a Western missionary invited her to hear the gospel, and both she and I were saved.
[197]  Still later I went to Shanghai and heard Brother Nee, who said that when we come to meetings, we should not only come for sermons, but we should come to pray as well.
[198]  I listened to the brothers praying, but I dared not pray myself, and I did not know anything about prayer.
[199]  I am a common, ordinary man who has not received much education.
[200]  I have been a believer for twenty-nine years.
[201]  Before I was saved, I could not find any rest from the world, even though I read a great deal of Buddhist literature.
[202]  Later I read the Bible and discovered that there is an explanation to every person, thing, and event in our life.
[203]  When I was seventeen I saw a demon being cast out of a man.
[204]  I was touched by the Lord's authority and believed in Him.
[205]  Before I became a Christian, I was very prejudiced against Christianity, and for a long time I opposed and rejected it.
[206]  In my youth I lived a free and romantic life, visiting theaters, playing card games, and learning to dance.
[207]  Once I took hospitality at a sister's house and heard the gospel.
[208]  I heard that there is a God in this universe and that He desires to draw near to man.
[209]  Soon after, I began to confess my sins to others.
[210]  I do not know the exact date when I was saved.
[211]  My parents were both Christians, and I am by nature a quiet person.
[212]  When I was ten years old, I began to sit through sermons.
[213]  Because my older brother and sister passed away early, I became the darling of the family.
[214]  I went into business in my own zeal but did not accomplish anything.
[215]  My father wanted me to study theology so that I could be a preacher.
[216]  After I graduated in 1927, I began to work as a preacher around the Hakkas people of south China.
[217]  In 1937 I saw that I was a sinner and believed in the Lord Jesus.
[218]  At that time I was very zealous, but later I became cold and backslidden.
[219]  At a certain point I repented in tears, yet I dared not turn back to the Lord.
[220]  At the age of thirteen I accepted the Lord.
[221]  When I asked to be baptized, I was told by the brothers that I was too young and that I should wait until I was older.
[222]  Later my father apprenticed me to a shop, and I worked there for three years.
[223]  Once, I was in a certain place, and I observed that only the rich were allowed to be baptized, and I became very angry.
[224]  At the time I was baptized, I was hoping that heaven would open to me and that a voice from heaven would witness that I am a son of God.
[225]  When I was young I went with an elderly brother to a church to listen to sermons.
[226]  The more I listened, the more I became interested.
[227]  I did not know that much about the gospel, yet I knew that something came into me that would never go away.
[228]  I heard the story of Christ and His cross and was moved to believe in the Lord.
[229]  When I attended a revival meeting in Canton, I experienced a great change and saw the importance of saving souls.
[230]  I quit my job as a teacher and accepted the invitation of a denomination to be their woman preacher.
[231]  At one point I felt uneasy in the denomination where I was, and I left.
[232]  I was greatly touched in 1928 when Brother Nee spoke on the story of Mary the Magdalene.
[233]  I became clear concerning my salvation in 1932 when I heard Dr. John Sung speak on the Samaritan woman.
[234]  For years I worked as a teacher but was weak and fraught with sickness.
[235]  I was nurtured in a good way in my family.
[236]  By nature I am a timid person, and from my youth I was afraid of hell.
[237]  Anyone who is bound by his emotion will feel happy when his emotion is up.
[238]  Through my sister's death, God turned me to believe in Him.
[239]  At that time I was not clear about salvation, but I felt that I was different inside.
[240]  Every time I confessed my sins to the Lord, my heart was filled with joy and peace.
[241]  After I believed in the Lord, I began to study the Bible and was interested in attending the meetings.
[242]  In my youth I always pondered the meaning of the human life.
[243]  I searched through Chinese traditions and ethical teachings, but I did not find any answer or profit.
[244]  Because of my active personality, I did not want to be bound by the job of a shopkeeper.
[245]  I had revolutionary thoughts, and I joined the Revolutionary Army at one time.
[246]  In the army I saw an opium addict who experienced a great change when he believed in the Lord.
[247]  CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 58 Date:September 13, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER I. S.
[248]  I was born into a poor family, and at one time I was a street hawker.
[249]  While I was on the street one day someone invited me into a little chapel to hear the gospel.
[250]  When I heard that Jesus loves sinners, I became very happy.
[251]  At that time I dared not accept the Lord.
[252]  One or two years later, when I was fifteen years old, I heard the gospel again and I raised my hand to receive the Lord.
[253]  I was born into a Christian family and studied in a parochial school.
[254]  Others considered me to be a good and well-behaved student, but I was not clear about my salvation.
[255]  I thought that a man is saved by his works.
[256]  In myself, I find nothing worthy of a testimony; there is nothing but corruption in me weeping as she testified .
[257]  I was born in 1909 and almost died the day I was born.
[258]  My family put me on the floor and called for a doctor.
[259]  Someone once asked me if I had believed in the Lord.
[260]  I told him yes and that I had peace in my heart.
[261]  I became a Christian at the age of seventeen.
[262]  I was married in Luo-Yang and met with the local church in Sian.
[263]  When I was young I became sick and sought for healing from the idols.
[264]  After I became well, I was given to one idol to be its adopted son.
[265]  In reminiscing over my spiritual journey, I find that I was following a brother for a long time.
[266]  Later I felt that I could no longer catch up with him.
[267]  When I was saved, I did not have any strong feelings, yet I definitely believed in the Lord.
[268]  At the age of sixteen I heard Paget Wilkes in a conference and came to realize that I was a sinner and needed the Savior.
[269]  From that time onward I believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior.
[270]  Once I went with my brother to cast out a demon.
[271]  Once when I was praying, I seemed to hear a voice, saying, "Just as I have saved you, you should save others."
[272]  During these years you have accumulated enough knowledge and heard enough messages, but you have not denied yourself enough.
[273]  I believed in the Lord Jesus and consecrated myself to Him through the gospel preaching of Brother Nee.
[274]  I read many books published by the Shanghai Gospel Book Room.
