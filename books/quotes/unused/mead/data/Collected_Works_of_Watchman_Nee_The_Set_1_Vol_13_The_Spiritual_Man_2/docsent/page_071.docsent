   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Fondness for pleasure is also a great expression ofemotional believers.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The emotion cannot bear allowing believers to live completely for God; it absolutely opposes the life that is constantly for God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Though believers may accept the demand of the Lord's cross and put to death the emotion so that they may live for the Lord, the emotion still asks that a small area be reserved for its activities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is why many believers cannot live for the Lord completely.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no need to speak of much, just a day's living; no need to mention other things, just the warfare of prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How many believers can engage in warfare by prayer that is completely for the Lord for one whole day, without saving some time for their own pleasure?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To have pleasure is to reserve some ground for our own emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How difficult it is for us to live in the spirit through the day!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We always keep some time for ourselves to talk with others because this is soothing to our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are shut in by God, seeing neither men nor sky, and are required to live in the spirit to work for Him before the throne, we know whether our emotion has been completely put to death or not.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We also know how much our emotion demands from us and how much we live by the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Emotional believers also like to be hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Emotion does not know the meaning of waiting for God, waiting for God's revelation, or following the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Emotion is always hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Emotion always causes the believer to become excited and to be impelled into action.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever this excitement comes with its impelling power, it urges the believer to act hastily.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The emotion is very upset and unwilling if the believer waits for the Lord, understands the will of God, and takes one step at a time, not walking by his own desire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a believer has not put his emotion to the cross, he cannot walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He must realize that of a hundred things done out of impulse, not even one is according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need time to pray, prepare, wait, and be refilled with the strength of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How else can there be no mistakes in our hasty acts?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God clearly knows that the emotion of our flesh is impatient; therefore, He always uses our co-workers, brothers, family, environment, and material things to hinder us and slow us down.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wants our hastiness to die completely so that He can work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Since God never does things in a hurry, He never grants power to those who act hurriedly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, the hasty doer can only do things by his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is clearly the work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God does not want the believer to walk by the flesh, so the believer must be willing to put his hurried emotion to death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever the emotion operates hastily, let us pray, "O Lord, the emotion is impatient once again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May Your cross operate."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who walks by the spirit must not be hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God does not want us to do anything by ourselves; He wants us to wait for Him and His command.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His command must be in all our doings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only the things that are commissioned in our spirit are of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How can this be accomplished by a believer who walks after his own desire?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a one is hasty even when he wants to follow the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He does not know that God not only has a will but also a time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we may be in one accord with His will, He still wants us to wait for His time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The flesh cannot tolerate this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once a believer presses on in the spirit, he will see that God's time and God's will are equally important.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are hasty to give birth to Ishmael, later he will be the greatest enemy of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All those who cannot wait for God's time cannot keep His will.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>An emotional believer will not wait for God because his desires are for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He likes to do everything on his own.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He cannot trust God and allow God to work for him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He cannot commit the whole matter into God's hands and refrain from using his own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is not able to trust because this requires the denial of his self.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Unless his desires are banished, his self will always stay active.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He loves to help God, as if God were too slow and needed his help.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the working of the soul, the activity of the self under the instigation of emotional desires.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the believer acts in a hasty manner, he will see that God causes his work to be ineffective; then he has no choice but to deny himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Self-vindication is a very common behavior among emotional believers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Being misunderstood and misjudged are matters that are encountered regularly by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although sometimes the Lord wants His children to clarify certain things, unless they are clear that this is the Lord's command, at most it is being done by the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>More often than not, the Lord desires that His people commit all things into His hand and not vindicate themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, how the believer loves to plead for himself!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How upsetting it is to be misunderstood, because this reduces his glory and lowers his dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The self will not be silent under the false accusations of others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He cannot accept what God has given to him nor wait for God to vindicate, because that is too slow; rather, he wants God to immediately clear him of any charge so that men would know his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This all comes from the soulish desire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If a believer would submit to God's powerful hand during a misunderstanding, he would see, through the misunderstanding, that God is causing him to deny his self in a deeper way and deny his soulish desire more thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is his practical cross.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Every time the believer receives a cross, he goes through its crucifixion once more.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, if he vindicates himself according to the desire of the self, he will learn that the power of self is harder to subdue the next time.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If the natural desire of a believer has not been dealt with by the cross, he will seek someone to whom he can pour out his heart when he is cast down in afflictions and worries.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>His emotion motivates him to long to speak forth his troubles to others so that the sorrow within his heart can be released and his burden lightened.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His natural desire is to make known his sorrows to others so that he may feel more comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>By making known his problems to others, he also hopes to gain sympathy and comfort from them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He lusts for sympathy and comfort because they make him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because he has not lost his natural desire or the desire for self, he is not satisfied that God alone knows.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He cannot commit his burden to the Lord, nor can he silently let God bring him into a deeper death through these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He prefers the consolation of men, apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His life lusts after what others can give him and despises God's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The believer should know that the most effective way for him to really lose his soul-life is to not seek men's sympathy and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The sympathy and comfort of worldly people are foods that feed our soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The life of the spirit is to fellowship with God so that it is satisfied with God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The power that can endure loneliness is the power of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Whenever we seek for any of man's ways to lighten our burden, we are walking according to our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God wants us to remain silent to enable the cross which He has arranged for us to accomplish its work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whenever a believer shuts his mouth in his affliction, he sees the cross working.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Being silent is the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whoever remains silent tastes the bitterness of the cross!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>His spiritual life is also nourished by the cross!</S>
