Thank you for your light concerning the apostles. The manuscript of the combined Issue Nos. 13 and 14 of The Christian magazine is ready and typeset. According to your instructions, I forwarded it by express mail to Shanghai the day before yesterday and charged Brother Ho Yueh-chao to send it to the printer. I wonder if mail from Shanghai will reach other places without difficulty. In this issue the "Notes on Scriptural Messages" column contains Brother Nee's message "God Interrupting Man's Speaking," the "Bible Study" column contains the message "The Work of the Holy Spirit in the Believers," and the "Footsteps of the Witnesses" column contains the account of "God's Vessel in the Welsh Revival," which was translated by Brother Stephen Kaung. All of these three articles are typeset in #3 characters, and the rest are in #4 characters. The "Testimony" column was contributed by Sister Chang Yi-hwa. This issue will cover the months of May through August. I will quickly put together another combined issue covering September through December. The Bible study here concluded last Friday. I had intended to visit Dong-Shiang this week but felt to delay visiting the village in order to put out more articles for The Christian and to have some fellowship with the brothers and sisters. A letter from Peking invited me to go there with my family, but I feel that I should work a little in east Tsinan for now. Thank the Lord that everything is peaceful and the meetings are as usual. Peace to you in the Lord. Greetings to Sisters Wang, Chang, and Tso.</p><p>Brother Witness Lee<br />December 9<br />[Address omitted]<br />(We have heard that it is difficult to send and receive printed material to and from Shanghai. Many readers of The Christian have moved because of the war, and there is no way for us to forward any mail to their new addresses. We are still considering whether we should print this issue now. If we publish it now, we intend to send it to the readers whose addresses are more reliable. We will send out the rest after we have received instructions from those who have moved&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Yu-zhi, Chungking</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter a few days ago. I am grateful that you remembered my health! I have been here for two months already, but it seems as if the work has hardly started. I deeply feel that I am not qualified to work for the Lord. My spirit, soul, and body are all weak, and I suffer the loneliness of being without any co-workers. Without the grace of God and the prayer of the saints, I would not have been able to stand fast. Thank the Lord that since my arrival in Chungking, I have testified and preached the gospel to the Quakers, the China Inland Mission, Chiu-Ching Middle School, Shu-Teh Girls' School, and Kuan-Ren Hospital. The meetings were quite good, but there were no obvious results. Dr. X came to Chungking and spoke for a few days. A group of people were touched and signed their names. They became desirous of the truth. The local Christian Council officially invited me to be their speaker once a week. I took up their invitation for the gospel's sake. Last Saturday was the first time I spoke. In the near future I will borrow the chapel of X denomination and conduct a gospel meeting there; the date has not yet been set. I have been waiting for co-workers to come to Chungking to start together, but now I have given up such hope. I do not understand why I seem to have lost my ability to walk by faith. When I was in Tientsin, I was captured by the promise of not walking by my own wisdom but walking by the grace of God. I might have been somewhat foolish, but I was quite bold. I did not consider everything so much. I did not trust in my own wisdom, and everything seemed to be working for my good. Whenever I now try to do something, I pray much and seek God's will. However, the more I pray, the more confused I become, and the more I seek after His will, the more I am bewildered. Sometimes I put aside this endeavor and revert to my former way of "trusting not in my own wisdom but in God's grace." But even when I do this, there seems to be some kind of bothering within. There is no assurance in whatever I do. The result is constant regret and self-condemnation. Do you know where my problem lies? I have also thought that if I preach the gospel here and God saves a group of sinners, I will start a Bible study at my own place, and if God gains these ones, I will set up a local church. Perhaps this is my dream. But when I consider that the work is the Lord's and that I do not have to take charge of anything, I become more at rest. Our home meeting was held on the Lord's Day morning, but due to the fact that I have been frequently invited to preach in the denominations, we have changed the time of meeting to Sunday afternoon. Now I can preach in the denominations on the Lord's Day morning. I have told you of the condition of the work and of my own condition so that I can receive some guidance from you. I hope that you will pray for me. I have been physically tired the last two days; this letter was written on my bed. Please excuse my untidy handwriting. Peace to you in the Lord!</p><p>Brother Chang Yu-zhi<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
