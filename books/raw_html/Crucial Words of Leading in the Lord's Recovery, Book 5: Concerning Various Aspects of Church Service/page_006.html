	 <h2 class="head2">Gathering Statistics</h2>
<p>We should make a list of the saints in the five categories mentioned above. These saints are the bases for the work. Then every district should make a list of the schools in which our saints are either staff or students and include the names of the saints. After we gather these statistics, we can use the saints who are staff members or students as the inside help, and the first three groups of saints can be added to them. Once we have the basic statistics, we can identify what each college, high school, or junior high school needs. Then we can make a schedule and also assign saints from the first three groups to the schools in an orderly manner.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Arranging Personnel according to Priorities</h2>
<p>We must take care of our priorities when we assign saints to the schools. If the need in a school is not urgent, we can send saints at a later time. After we have all the necessary statistics, we will know how many saints will be needed for a school. According to this information, we can assign saints to labor in the schools. These assignments should not be according to a saint&rsquo;s preference or desire. In the work there should not be a situation where anyone works independently. Instead, there should be coordination according to priorities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Researching the Ways to Preach</h2>
<p>First, we should gather various statistics, and then according to the statistics, we can arrange our personnel. After the saints are arranged, we should focus our attention on studying the individual schools. How do we preach the gospel in junior high schools? How do we preach in high schools? How do we preach in technical colleges? The way that we preach the gospel should match the situation of a school. Most junior high schools do not allow outsiders to enter their campus, but it is permissible to enter university campuses. The universities also have different situations. Some universities do not have dormitories or large open areas, whereas others, such as the National Taiwan University, have large open areas. All these factors need to be considered. Based on the situation of a school, we can make a specific plan. Just as there are many ways to reach a destination, there are many ways to carry out a task. We need to study the situation of every school.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who are burdened for the gospel in the schools should be assigned to labor in a school and should study the various situations in that school. The other saints should also consider how they can participate in this work. There are two difficulties in preaching the gospel to the junior high students: junior high students have a heavy load of schoolwork, and all the parents are vigilant to watch over their children. The parents send their children to school in the morning, and after school they escort their children to extra classes. They closely monitor their children. From Monday to the Lord&rsquo;s Day, parents closely watch their children. From an educational point of view, this is good. If I were a parent, I would do the same. We should not carelessly say that the parents hinder the gospel. We should not cause the gospel to interfere with the education of the children. We respect their education. If our contact with the students distracts them from their studies, their parents will oppose us and may even prevent their children from contacting us.</p>
<p>Does this mean we cannot work in the junior high schools? It seems that the best way is to rely on the students and staff in the school. We need to gather the saints who are either students or staff members in the same school to fellowship and pray together and to consider the ways to preach the gospel in that school. As long as we are willing to consider and fellowship, the Lord can lead us to find out the best way. It may be that the saints who are teachers should be the first to contact the students. The saints who are students can spontaneously preach the gospel to their classmates. On the weekends there can be a gospel outreach for a particular school, and we can invite the students to the meeting hall or to our homes for a gospel gathering. There is always an opportunity to gain people. Through the brothers and sisters who are either staff members or students, we can spread the gospel to the junior high schools.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Studying Scientifically</h2>
<p>We should take a further step in our study. Not only should we invite others to hear the gospel; we can also print material, such as small booklets and gospel tracts. We need to be like gourmet chefs who can cook elaborate dishes using the same three ingredients: vegetables, meat, and fish. Studying scientifically does not mean that we need to use scientific instruments but that we should not use old methods to do things. In our labor we need to study; that is, we need to apply a scientific approach. Gathering statistics is an example of a scientific method used for our study.</p>
<p>We will not achieve results if we scatter seeds randomly or carelessly. Rather, we should sow seeds just like a farmer. We first need to identify which fields belong to us; we should never scatter seeds wildly. Then we need to observe whether the ground is flat, and whether it will retain water. If the field has a slope, we need to make it level. To be a competent farmer requires a study of the various situations related to the ground. We also need to study which area needs seeds planted earlier and which area needs seeds planted later. Some seeds may be sown fifteen days earlier than other seeds. All of this requires study. Furthermore, there is the need to study the different types of seeds. For example, there are different species of wheat. One should never buy the wrong kind of seed, and different seeds require different fields. This is the scientific way to farm. Everything is studied thoroughly so that seeds are sown at the right time, in the right condition, and on the right ground. This illustration helps us to understand that we can no longer do anything in a casual way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING SCIENTIFIC WAYS<br />
AND DOING EVERYTHING WITH A GOOD AIM</h2>
<p>The age has progressed; in order to do anything, one has to apply a scientific way and have a goal. We cannot be careless. Some people do not agree with Chinese medicine because it lacks scientific studies. Chinese medicine specializes in four matters: gold, wood, fire, and earth. A person who is high in fire, or is hot, needs to bring down the level of fire. Such speaking lacks a scientific basis, and it is difficult for others to accept. The strength of Western medicine is scientific research. Everything must be verified in a laboratory. As a result, the medicine is almost always effective. Western doctors know that some medications cannot cure a patient but merely afford temporary comfort for the patient to maintain his organic functions and relieve his pain. Such medication is a help to the patient because it is a product of scientific study. We should not continue to do things in an antiquated way. We should do things according to our study. We can compare this to hunting rabbits with the aid of a hawk. We should not let the hawk out unless we see a rabbit; we do not want to let the hawk out randomly, because after it flies for a while, it will come back with nothing. But if we see a rabbit and release the hawk, the rabbit will be caught. This is what we mean by applying a scientific approach.</p>
<p>We do not want the brothers and sisters to carry loudspeakers and walk around a campus shouting. This will disturb the entire school and may eventually cause the school to chase us out of the campus. That is not a scientific way to preach the gospel. Furthermore, except for the Lord&rsquo;s Day when we should be at the table meeting, all the ones laboring on the campuses should spend six days participating in a variety of gatherings, such as the prayer meeting, the small group meeting, and other kinds of meetings for the campus work. They can also study the Bible in small groups. In principle, there should be work to do every evening. We must not be idle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOROUGHLY STUDYING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>In summary, we should thoroughly study every school where we are serving. We must know what the need is and what the overall situation is at a school. We must know whether our personnel can meet the need of a place and how we should carry out the work. All of this requires time before any action can be taken. In this way nothing will be in vain, and we will have results.</p>
<p>This fellowship is not theoretical; it is practical. We need to fellowship concerning all of our views. This will help us to learn to do things scientifically. Some of the saints have learned the way to preach the gospel in the schools, and they have gained a wealth of experience. These ones should share their experience concerning the difficulties and benefits of the gospel work in the schools, how to utilize resources, and what things to avoid. If we could present all the relevant issues for further study, our work will not be in vain.</p>
