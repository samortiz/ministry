   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: O Lord, we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For Your economy and Your speaking, we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We bow down to You from the depths of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You are the Lord who speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You speak words to us with enlightening revelation and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>O Lord, as we come to the final message, we pray that You would speak thoroughly and completely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also pray that You would reach every one of us with Your words that we may all hear Your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord Jesus, as the speaking God, You are the Word of God; we worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May You touch every one of us in our depths and sow every word of Yours into us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>O Lord, cleanse us with Your precious blood; we need Your cleansing every day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have the filthiness of our natural being, the filthiness of our flesh, the filthiness of our lusts, and the filthiness of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, all these need the cleansing of Your precious blood in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thank and praise You that Your precious blood is always accompanied by the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the cleansing of the blood, we enjoy the anointing of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We believe that Your ointment is here anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once more we ask You to give us utterance and grant us fresh and up-to-date words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this message we come to the conclusion, which is the consummation of the believers experience of the grace of God in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the course of carrying out His economy, God first handed down the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The law is His portrait, His image, His photo ; it is not His organic person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Galatians 3:21 tells us that the law cannot give life because there is no life in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although a photo cannot give life, it has its function.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The law in God s economy is used by God to expose sinners in their sinful nature and evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before His law all mouths are shut.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have violated, broken, every commandment of the Ten Commandments, from the first one to the last one.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have had numerous idols apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have not taken God as our satisfaction, neither have we taken what He has accomplished for us as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we have forsaken God as the fountain of living waters to hew out for ourselves cisterns, broken cisterns, which hold no water Jer 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have not traced back to our beginning, our origin, to honor our source the very God who created us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, our hearts have been filled with murder, adultery, stealing, lying, and coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have not lived out God s outward virtues according to His inward attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>David was a very devout person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Psalm 1 he related how he appreciated the law and meditated in it by day and by night like a tree planted beside streams of water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, after David s word of appreciation in Psalm 1, God repudiated David s concept and announced concerning His Anointed, You are My Son; / Today I have begotten You 2:7b .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In resurrection God has begotten His Anointed as His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s desire is that we listen to His anointed Firstborn instead of appreciating the law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Psalm 3 was written by David in his flight from his son Absalom s rebellion, which was the outcome of David s sin of murder and robbing a man of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Psalm 1, David was one who appreciated the law, yet in Psalm 3 he was fleeing from his rebellious son as a consequence of his murder and robbing a man of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The result of David s appreciation of the law was murder and robbing a man of his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The law of God fully uncovered David s sinful nature and evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The entire book of one hundred fifty psalms shows us that the law is used by God to expose man in his sinful nature and evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now the New Testament believers in God s economy are not under law but under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The grace in God s economy is God s embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God became flesh to dwell among us, full of grace, and of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When God comes, grace comes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s embodiment is grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we receive grace, we obtain God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God s economy is to work out an organism for the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How does He work this out?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is by His becoming flesh to be a man that His divinity and humanity might be united and mingled to produce a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This God-man is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whomever He meets, He is grace to them; wherever He goes, He is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is simply grace.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we have Him, we have grace.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, in the Bible grace is called the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The embodied grace came for us to receive as our enjoyment and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, there are few who see this today, even fewer who preach this, and very few who live this out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we experience the grace in God s economy, there will be a consummation the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ to us is grace; as such, He comes into us to be our life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He not only lives in us but also lives with us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moreover, He wants us to live along with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is to enjoy grace as our inner supply.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Such an enjoyment of grace spontaneously produces a result.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This result is not merely that we do good.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rather, it is that Christ lives with us and we with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we live Christ and magnify Christ, we become the living members, organic members, of Christ, and we all are organically joined as an organism, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This organism grows continually, and ultimately there will be a consummation the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The last stanza of Hymns, #840 says,</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In God s house and in Thy Body</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Builded up I long to be,</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That within this corporate vessel</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All shall then Thy glory see;</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>That Thy Bride, the glorious city,</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May appear upon the earth,</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>As a lampstand brightly beaming</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To express to all Thy worth.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christianity has not seen this, and accordingly, they do not have such a result.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I expect that in the Lord s recovery there will be such a possibility and such an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is my burden, and this is why I grieve.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Today there are many arguments and discussions, but there are not many who have seen this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you see this vision, you will weep.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Where is the glorious city today?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>That Thy Bride, the glorious city, may appear upon the earth is this possible?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Are we enjoying grace and the supply of grace?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>May the Lord have mercy upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are a group of people who really need His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We should be a group of people who experience and enjoy grace in our living and in our words and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This grace is God s embodiment that we supply to others that they also may receive grace with us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As a result, our experience has a consummation the Body of Christ.</S>
