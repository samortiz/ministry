Our salvation not only can be proved with assurance, but it is also secure. [Once we have it, we have it eternally. It can never be shaken or changed.] According to the revelation of the Bible, the security of salvation is demonstrated by the following twelve items:</p><h2 class="head1">By the Invariable God</h2><p>First, our salvation is secured by the invariable God. James 1:17 says that with the Father there is &#8220;no variation or shadow cast by turning.&#8221;...He is not like the heavenly bodies, which turn and whose shadows also change, as seen in the waxing and waning of the moon while it revolves around the earth and in the eclipsing of the sun by the moon. God is secure; He is not variable, not changeable. Therefore, since He has saved us, our salvation can never be changed, and we shall never perish.</p><h2 class="head1">By God&#8217;s Unchanging Will</h2><p>Our salvation is secured by God&#8217;s unchanging will. Hebrews 6:17 speaks of &#8220;the unchangeableness of His [God&#8217;s] counsel.&#8221; Since God&#8217;s counsel, that is, God&#8217;s will, is unchangeable, the fact that He chose us and predestinated us before the foundation of the world that we might receive His salvation (Eph. 1:4-5, 11) is also unchangeable. Since He chose and predestinated us in eternity past that we might receive sonship and become His inheritance, He will carry it out and will not fail.</p><h2 class="head1">By God&#8217;s Inseparable Love</h2><p>Our salvation is also secured by God&#8217;s inseparable love. First John 4:10 says, &#8220;Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.&#8221; If we are saved because we love God, then our salvation is not reliable. However, we are saved because God loved us; that is, our salvation is of God&#8217;s love. Since God is unchanging, His love is also unalterable. Moreover, His love toward us is an inseparable love (Rom. 8:39)....Because of God&#8217;s inseparable love, His salvation within us will never fail; it is forever secure and unchanging.</p><h2 class="head1">By God&#8217;s Irrevocable Calling</h2><p>Romans 11:29 says that the calling of God is irrevocable. Since God&#8217;s calling comes out of His invariable being and is according to His unchanging will, it is irrevocable and unalterable....Therefore, according to God&#8217;s calling, our salvation is eternally secure.</p><h2 class="head1">By God&#8217;s Unchallengeable Justification</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus was judged on the cross by God&#8217;s righteousness on our behalf and thereby satisfied God&#8217;s righteous requirement, we who believe in Him are justified according to God&#8217;s righteousness to show forth God&#8217;s righteousness (Rom. 3:26)....[Moreover], since the Lord Jesus has satisfied God&#8217;s righteous requirement on our behalf, God can-and He must-forgive us and justify us according to His righteousness; otherwise, He would make Himself unrighteous....Romans 8:33 says, &#8220;Who shall bring a charge against God&#8217;s chosen ones? Shall God, who justifies?&#8221; (RcV, margin). Since God is bound by His righteousness, He must justify us; He cannot accuse us or condemn us any longer....Hence, our salvation is eternally secure.</p><h2 class="head1">By God&#8217;s Almighty Hand</h2><p>In John 10:29 the Lord said, &#8220;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&#8217;s hand.&#8221; Because God is greater than all, He is more powerful than anything. No one can snatch us out of His almighty hand. Hence, as far as God&#8217;s almighty hand is concerned, our salvation is secure.<sup>22</sup></p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Topics for New Believers, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
