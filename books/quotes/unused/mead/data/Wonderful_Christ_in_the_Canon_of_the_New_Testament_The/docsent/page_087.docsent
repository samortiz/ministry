   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A PREPARED BRIDE AND AN ADORNED CITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter nineteen, the marriage of the lamb is come, and His Bride has made herself ready with white linen Rev 19:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is really good, but it is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must read on until we come to chapters twenty-one and twenty-two.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we see that the Bride is the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now she is not only ready, but adorned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>She is not just a bride, but a city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She has become a city-bride.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She is God s tabernacle, the holy city, New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I really like the sight of this New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have traveled through almost forty countries, and I have seen many great cities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, by the time I came to this country, I lost my interest in seeing big cities.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have seen the holy city, so I do not need to see any other city.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The holy city, the New Jerusalem, is the Bride of Christ and the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A SHINING TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we have seen at least five aspects concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There are the seven lampstands, the wonderful woman with the manchild, the crop with the firstfruits and the harvest, the Bride prepared for a wedding, and the New Jerusalem, the adorned Bride.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we come to the book of Revelation, we must spend most of our time with these five aspects as well as all the revelation regarding Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should forget about the Antichrist, the ugly beast, the ten horns, and the wrong set of sevens, and spend our time with Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this book, the church is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Firstly, we see that the church in this dark age is God s shining testimony; so the church must be the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As God s shining testimony, all the local churches must be the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, as the lampstands only, they could not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The stand must hold the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And we have seen that the lamps in this age are the seven Spirits, the intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The testimony of Jesus is the speaking Spirit, and this is the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Seven times in this book it says, He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The speaking Spirit is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation 19:10 says, The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the speaking Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prophecy is not just to predict, but to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is to speak something of Jesus, something concerning Jesus, and something for Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit of this kind of speaking is the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the real lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church must hold this shining lamp in this dark age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE MANCHILD WITHIN THE WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is also the greater part of this wonderful woman in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s people in His eyes are never a male, but a female.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the whole universe, God is the unique male.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He is the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea all tell us that Israel was God s wife Isa 54:5; Jer 3:14; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>16:32; Hosea 2:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is the husband, and His people are His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church, we know, is the wife of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since God s people are a woman, God s enemy from the very beginning has tried to damage this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To understand the woman in Revelation 12, we must go back to Eve in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The serpent sought to damage her.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God told the serpent that He would put enmity between him and the woman Gen 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that there is enmity between Satan and God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the same in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The woman is God s people, and the dragon seeking to devour her child is the old serpent, the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have seen by this woman that God s people are composed of three sections: the patriarchs, the people of Israel under the law, and the church under grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church is symbolized by being clothed with the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Israel under the law is symbolized by the moon under her feet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This indicates that this part is not respected so much as the other parts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet the patriarchs were a crown on her head, because the principle with the patriarchs was the same as that with the church: it was the principle of grace, not the principle of law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since the woman is the weaker vessel, she needs a stronger part.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The stronger part of the woman in Revelation 12 is the manchild within her.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And she brought forth a manchild, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne Rev 12:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The manchild is not Christ, but a corporate person consisting of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Revelation 12:10, the manchild is called the brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This proves that this manchild is not individual, but corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is this manchild that defeats Satan and casts him down from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their soul lives unto the death Rev 12:10-11, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>. This woman s child is the ultimate fulfillment of the prophecy in Genesis 3:15: He shall bruise thy head.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The individual seed of the woman on the cross bruised the serpent s head, and the corporate seed of the corporate woman eventually casts down Satan from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The corporate manchild is raptured to the heavens, and casts down the old serpent, the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Because of this the salvation and the kingdom of God with the authority of His Christ are come.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Praise the Lord that the brethren overcame him!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is the corporate manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church as the people of God needs to conceive a stronger part.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The present part of this manchild should be in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do not mean that every member of the local churches is a part of that manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But I do mean that today in the local churches there are a number of stronger ones who are the strong part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The gentler part of the church is the woman, and the strong part of the church is the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is for the purpose of defeating God s enemy and casting him down.</S>
