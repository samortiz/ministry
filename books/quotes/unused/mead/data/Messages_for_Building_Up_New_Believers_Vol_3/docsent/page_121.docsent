   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Intermediary Class Abolished</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Everyone Serves</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to abolish the intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order for us to abolish this class, we all have to become part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When all of us become a part of that class, the hierarchy is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can we make the three groups two groups?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can we turn three-way traffic into two-way traffic?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can these three God, the priesthood, and the people become two?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no other way except to kneel down before the Lord and say, Lord, I am willing to serve You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am willing to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When all of God s children become His priests, the three parties will be reduced to two.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hierarchy comes from the world, the flesh, idol worship, and the love of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If all the brothers deny the world and reject idolatry from the beginning, they will all offer themselves up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They will say, From this day forward, I will live on earth for the sole purpose of serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then hierarchy will disappear spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If all the brothers realize that their sole occupation is to serve God and if all of them will serve God in coordination, the intermediary class will disappear!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. One Needing to Be a Priest As Long As</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One Is a Christian</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope you will not allow any intermediary class to come in. Uphold this from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only among the fallen and backslidden ones and among those who walk according to their own way could there be the resurgence of an intermediary class.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Among those defeated ones, it is natural for some to serve the Lord and some not to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Those who do not serve the Lord attend to their own affairs, while those who serve the Lord take care of spiritual affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who do not serve the Lord, at most, offer some money to support those who serve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may be businessmen, teachers, or doctors, but they all attend to their own affairs and walk their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They do not seem to have anything to do with God s service.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this kind of setting, what does a person need to do to qualify to be a good Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He only needs to set aside a little time every week to attend a worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If he has some money, he only needs to offer a small portion of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But this clearly makes God s people and His priests two classes of people!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today we should realize that either we are not Christians at all or we have to be those who consecrate everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as we are Christians, we have to be priests to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE RECOVERY OF THE PRIESTHOOD A. There Being No Problem in the Early Churches</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The danger that haunted the nation of Israel is the same problem that has confronted the church over the past two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the time of the Lord s departure until the time of the writing of Revelation and a little beyond that point, all of God s children were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone who considered himself a child of God was a priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was no problem then.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was no problem from the first century up through the third century.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Individually, there were isolated problems here and there, but as a whole there was no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here and there some of God s children refused to be priests, but as a whole we did not see any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As long as a person was a child of God, he was a priest of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>B. The Church s Nature Being Changed after</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>the Roman Empire s Acceptance of Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Roman Empire endorsed Christianity, many people began to creep in. There were material benefits in believing in the Lord; one became a fellow believer of the emperor and a brother of Caesar.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally, the Lord s charge was, Render then the things that are Caesar s to Caesar and the things that are God s to God Matt 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now both the things of Caesar and the things of God were rendered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indeed was a big victory for Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Constantine was converted to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The result was a gradual but significant shift for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Believers were no longer the same as those who professed their faith at an earlier age.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>During the ten periods of persecution under the reign of Rome, tens of thousands of Christians suffered martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was not easy to pretend to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But then the situation totally changed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It became fashionable to be a believer and to share the same faith as the emperor and to call him one s brother.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When this shift occurred, many decided to join Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As a result, the number of people increased, while the number of priests remained the same.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is easy to creep into the Christian fold, but it is absolutely impossible to creep into God s service.</S>
