   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE THIRD GREAT PILLAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE LORD S RECOVERY THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; 18:17; Acts 8:1; 9:31; 12:1; 13:1; 14:23; Rom 16:1, 3-5a, 16, 20; 1 Cor 12:28; Rev 1:4-5a, 11 THE DEFINITION OF THE CHURCH The Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The four pillars in the Lord s recovery are the truth, life, the church, and the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament the first person is Christ and the second person is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today Christians in general pay some attention to Christ, but they do not pay much attention to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although they often mention the church and discuss it, in their realization the church is nothing but a building or a human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the Bible clearly shows us that the church is the Body of Christ Eph 1:22b-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church was produced by Christ, Christ is the Head of the church, and the church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A human body is not an organization but a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, the church is not an organization but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As believers, we are the members of this organism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A person s body has many members, but it is still one body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The members of the body are comely and lovely and are able to receive the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, once a member is separated from the body, not only will it lose its life and function, it will also become a dreadful member.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose someone cut off his own hand and gave it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This would scare you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if his hand remains attached to his body, it can warmly shake your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is regrettable and terrible that many Christians today are like hands cut off from the body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They have become individualistic members who are detached from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition, because they are separated from the Body, they lack the life supply of the Body and lose their usefulness in the Lord s hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The House of God and of the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible also says that the church is the house of the believers cf.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gal 6:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this house, God is the Father and we are the children.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, this house is the house of God Eph 2:19; 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If a person is homeless, he becomes a wanderer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many Christians today are like homeless wanderers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They would rather be Christians on the roadside than children in the Father s house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether it is referred to as the Body of Christ or the house of God, we believers need the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since we are members of the Body of Christ, we must remain in the Body; since we are children in the house of God, we must stay in the house.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE LORD S INTENTION TO BUILD</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE REDEEMED BELIEVERS INTO THE CHURCH The Lord s Dealing with the Believers and Perfecting of the Believers through the Church</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible reveals to us that the Lord s purpose in saving us is to build us into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christians often say that they need to edify and build themselves up, but the Bible says that the Lord wants to build the church Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In my experience of serving the Lord for more than fifty years, I have never seen an individual Christian who was able to build himself up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more individualistic we are, the more we are unable to build ourselves up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can be built up only when we are in the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we are in ourselves, we can only cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more individualistic and peculiar a believer is, the more he will be full of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more individualistic and natural he is, the more he will be full of the disposition of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The peculiar disposition and natural life of a Christian cannot be removed in any other place; they can only be dealt with in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every member in the church is both a supply and a dealing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Suppose there is a person with a quick temper who is concerned about doing everything with speed and efficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even after such a one has been married for twenty-five years, his wife may still be unable to deal with his quick temper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, once he comes to the church and is built up in the church, his quick temper is slain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He wants to be fast, but the Lord arranges a slow person to coordinate with him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose there is another person who has a slow temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His family also may have no way to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, once he comes to the church, the Lord will have a way to make him become faster.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is really wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord arranges the quick ones to hasten the slow ones, and He arranges a few slow ones to deal with the quick ones.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All the married ones know that husbands do not know how to deal with wives, nor do wives know how to deal with husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a husband is too harsh on his wife, she may refuse to cook or do the laundry.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She may also murmur a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All husbands confess that none of them is capable of dealing with his wife, so as to make her a better wife.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Husbands simply have no way to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, if a husband wants his wife to be dealt with, he has to bring her to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is the best place for her to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the same way, there is not one wife who can adjust her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The best way to adjust one s husband is to send him to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The church is the best place for us to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, if my feet wanted to walk but my hands were not willing to go forward, these two would have to fight and deal with one another because the feet cannot tell the hands, Since you are uncooperative and unwilling to go forward, we should be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This separation would cause the feet to become dreadful feet.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today some Christians are similarly dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>May our eyes be opened to see this serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once we are detached from the church, we are useless and become the most dreadful persons.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have no other way or choice; our destiny is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is God s sovereign wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We stand on the ground of locality in the Lord s recovery and cannot choose a church according to our desire.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today Christianity is like a marketplace of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you want to buy a pair of shoes that you like, you can choose between a few shoe stores; however, you cannot choose which church that you would like to go to, because there is only one church in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you complain that your local church is not good and decide that since you are not satisfied with it, you want to choose another one, you will have to move to another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You may move to another place, but if you have not changed, the church there will be even worse.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eventually, you may move many more times.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Thus, you will become a Christian who is on the roadside.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is very pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, when we mention the church, on the one hand it is so sweet, but on the other hand it is unbearable.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The first stanza of Hymns, #852 says, Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love; / It is Thy Church so blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, many people do not think this way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They may say, O Lord, Your dwelling place is pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I really cannot live there any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Why don t You give me a better church?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Eventually, having left the church, these ones are without a church and become wandering Christians, individualistic members.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Peter is the best pattern of our need to be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus said to him that he was a piece of stone and that He had to build him, this piece of stone, into the church v. 18; 1 Pet 2:5 . Peter was one who had a quick temper Matt 17:24-27 . Only the church could deal with him and make him mature.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Everyone who is as fast and wild as Peter has to be in the church in order to be transformed.</S>
