<h2 class="head1">LETTERS FROM BROTHER CHANG KUANG JUNG</h2><h2 class="head2">One</h2><p>Brother Chi T'ang:</p><p>Thank you for taking me to the train station recently. Brother Luan and Brother Chen from Hua She came to meet the train when it arrived in Nan Hsin. The train over the river was very crowded, but thank the Lord, we all had seats. When the train arrived in Ke Ch'iao, Brother Chou was waiting to pick us up. We took a paddle boat to Hua She, and my third elder brother was the first to come out to shake our hands and receive us into the house. Our room and board were very convenient. My second elder brother took special care of us. We did not spend any money on the way from Nan Hsin to Hua She. The brothers from Hua She who came to pick us up paid for everything. Therefore, of the X dollars you gave to the Lord, I gave X dollars to Brother Luan. We really thank the Lord.</p><p>We had meetings for six days in Hua She, (from the Lord's Day the tenth until Friday the fifteenth). There were three meetings a day. Fortunately, I had Brother Luan and Brother Hsu to help. Tomorrow I plan to leave Hua She and go to Yi Lung. I will probably stay for only four days in Yi Lung, from the Lord's Day the seventeenth, until Wednesday the twen-tieth. Brother Hsu and I will go to Lan Hsi on Thursday.</p><p>The brothers in Hua She are very dear. I have seen with my own eyes how much they hunger and thirst. If the Lord sends me again, I will still go there. They really have a great need. I will not go into the condition of the meeting here. May the Lord gain something, and may I be more humble in learning to serve the Lord. Peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Kuang Jung<br />February 15, 1935 in Hua She</p><h2 class="head2">Two</h2><p>Dear brothers in the Lord:</p><p>I left Shanghai in a hurry to go to Hua She, so I did not have a chance to ask for a letter of recommendation from you. I am very sorry. I will now go from Hua She to Yi Lung and Lan Hsi. Perhaps I will go from Lan Hsi to Hangchow. Please give me a long-term letter of recommendation so that I can fellowship in any place where there is the Lord's table. I really thank you and hope you can do this. It would be best if the letter of recommendation could be sent to Brother Luan in Hangchow to keep for me.</p><p>Thank the Lord, during this trip Brother Philip Luan and Brother David Hsu are both working with me. Please pray for Hua She, Yi Lung, and Lan Hsi. I will be very grateful. Please greet Mr. Lin Kuang Piao, Mr. Wu Hsi You, and Mr. Lin Chung Ch'en.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Kuang Jung<br />February 14, mailed from Hua She</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM HU SHAN, NAN KANG, P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE</h2><p>To my dear brother in the Lord, Mr. Witness:</p><p>It has been more than a month since we parted, and I miss you. Thank the Lord, when my younger brother returned home I learned that you received special grace from the Lord and your illness has been healed. My heart is full of joy. May the grace of the Father be with you always so that you can accomplish God's plan in this last age, amen.</p><p>My brother and the co-workers were all cared for by the Lord, so they arrived safely home. Please do not worry about them from afar.</p><p>Brother, in a place called Hsia Huei Hsiao (about three miles from Hu Shan), there are some brothers, Hsiao Lien San, Chiang Kuo Ch'en, and others. They have received the Lord's enlightenment and know that denominations are wrong. As they have gone on, they have felt more and more that if they did not leave, they would not have peace. Therefore, they recently left the denominations (the Tu Lung Independent Church). They often come to our locality to meet. The way is rather far, and the women feel that it is not convenient. In addition, there are some language barriers. For these reasons they have decided to meet in their own locality. The Lord has arranged a meeting place and some to bear the responsibility for the meetings. The only thing they lack is one with the gift of giving messages, so they often come to ask the brothers from our locality to bear the responsibility for the work there. I do not have any light concerning this matter, and I do not know how to deal with it. (Can we agree to their requests?) Furthermore, can the table meeting be started without sisters? I ask you to give me some clear teachings about these matters so that the Lord's name is not shamed because of my ignorance. May you have peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Chou Ta Ch'ing</p><h2 class="head2">Answering Letter</h2><p>Dear brother in the Lord, Ta Ch'ing:</p><p>I received your letter long ago. I am sorry for the delay in answering; please forgive me in the Lord. According to the principle in the Bible, a local assembly should care for the nearby localities which have assemblies raised up after it (Acts 8:14-15; 11:22-23). Since the locality of Hsia Huei Hsiao is close to Hu Shan and the brothers there want you to help them, you should visit and help them.</p><p>It is best if there can be sisters when the table is established. However, it is not necessary in the beginning. When the Lord established His supper, the Bible shows us that there were only the apostles&mdash;no sisters&mdash;eating with Him (Matt. 26:20; Mark 14:17; Luke 22:14). Peace.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Witness Lee<br />February 18, in Shanghai</p>
