   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXPERIENCE AND GROWTH IN LIFE MESSAGE SIX THE GROWTH IN LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:1-6 FREED FROM THE LAW OF SIN AND OF DEATH Being in Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Romans 7 speaks of our involvement with several persons.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter there are a woman vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2-3 , two husbands vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2-4 , "I" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>7-24 , and sin vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>8-9, 11, 13-14, 17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapter eight shows us another person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 1 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are now in Christ Jesus, not in the old husband, the "I," or sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if in our experience we remain in the old husband or the "I," we are under sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Romans 7, sin is a person vv.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>8, 9, 11, 17, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is difficult to say whether this person is Satan or ourself, because these two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 16 when Peter rebuked the Lord, saying, "God be merciful to You, Lord," Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind Me, Satan!" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that time, Peter and Satan were one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The "I" in Romans 7 is not merely identified with Satan; the "I" and Satan are one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus Christ is the only person in the entire universe who is not one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>On the one hand, sin is Satan himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the other hand, because Satan injected himself into the human race, the entire human race also became sin, that is, the entire human race became one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the eyes of God, Satan, sin, and the human race are one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we live by the "I," we cannot avoid sin, because the "I" is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can never get away from sin, and we can never overcome sin because we ourselves are sin.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of how good one might seem to be in the eyes of others, in the eyes of God he is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The experience of sin in Romans 7 leads us into condemnation 7:24; 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The condemnation in Romans 8:1 is not the condemnation concerning the things we did in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is the condemnation of our current situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No one else condemns himself as much as a seeking Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before we were seeking Christ, we did not condemn ourselves very much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we had a clearance with God, we made up our mind to be perfect, pure, and right in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, we may constantly condemn ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who seek the Lord may not only be under this condemnation day after day, but even hour after hour.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We condemn ourselves that we are wrong in our attitude and wrong in the way we speak, in the inaccurate words we use.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If one means business to seek after Christ, he may become a person that constantly condemns himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the condemned person unveiled in Romans 7 who eventually says: "Wretched man that I am!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who will deliver me from the body of this death?" v. 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Romans 7 Paul could not escape from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, in chapter eight he declares, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus" v. 1 . Paul was no longer in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, he was not in sin, that is, he was not in Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was in another person, Christ Jesus, who in our experience of life is the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ Jesus in verse 1 and the Spirit of life in verse 2 are one person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without being the Spirit of life, Christ could not be real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Christ we are freed from condemnation because Christ Jesus today is the Spirit of life.</S>
