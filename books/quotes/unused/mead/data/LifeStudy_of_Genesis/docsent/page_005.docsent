   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE GENERAL SKETCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With every book of the Bible, there is a general sketch.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The general sketch of Genesis is:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God created, Satan corrupted, man fell, and</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Jehovah promised to save.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Never forget these four items!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although Genesis has 50 chapters, it is so simple; it is divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Chapters 1 and 2 are the first section, chapters 3 through 11 the second section, and chapters 12 through 50 the third section.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Each section begins with a name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The names in sections one and three are wonderful, but not the name in section two.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the first section we have "God," in the second section the "serpent," and in the third section "Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the King James Version "Jehovah" is translated as "the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God created, the serpent corrupted, and Jehovah called.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What did God create?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Ultimately God created man because the heavens are for the earth and the earth is for man, and man is for God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After God's creation, the subtle one, that is the serpent, crept in to corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He really corrupted God's creation, starting with rebellion and ending with rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Chapter 11 reveals the rebellion of the fallen race to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There was no hope.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nevertheless, there was hope because Jehovah came in to call out Abraham for a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God created, the serpent corrupted, but Jehovah called.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In which section are you?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can testify that fifty years ago I was in the second section, but today I am in the third section.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Fifty years ago I was one corrupted by the serpent, but now I am one called by Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first two chapters are apparently a record of God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then, in the following 48 chapters we find biographies of eight great persons: Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah a group of four; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph another group of four.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Each group belongs to a different race.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first four belong to the Adamic race, and the last four belong to the Abrahamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the book of Genesis are two fathers: Adam, the father of the created race, and Abraham, the father of the called race.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do you belong to the created race or to the called race?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the called ones are sons of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Galatians 3 tells us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ is a son of Abraham vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>7, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once we were created, but now we are called.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Corinthians 1:24 says that to the called ones Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are no longer the created race, but are forever the called race, called to partake of and enjoy Christ.</S>
