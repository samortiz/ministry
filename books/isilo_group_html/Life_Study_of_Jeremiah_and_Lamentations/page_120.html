THE RESTORATION OF ISRAEL<br>TAKING PLACE AFTER JEHOVAH'S CHASTISEMENT<br>OF ISRAEL WITH JUSTICE</H2><P>The restoration of Israel will take place after Jehovah's chastisement (punishment) of Israel with justice (30:11b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Jehovah Not Leaving Him Unpunished</H2><P>Jehovah will not leave him unpunished. His hurt is incurable, and there are no healing medicines for him (vv. 12-13). Jehovah has struck him with the striking of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, because of the greatness of his iniquity (vv. 14-15). All those who consume him will be consumed, and every one of them will go into captivity. Jehovah will bring him recovery and will heal him of his wounds (vv. 16-17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Ephraim Lamenting</H2><P>Jehovah says that He has heard Ephraim lamenting. As Ephraim lamented, he said, "You have chastised me, and I was chastised, / Like an untrained calf; / Bring me back that I may be restored, / For You are Jehovah my God. / For after I turned back, I repented; / And after I was instructed, / I struck myself on the thigh. / I was ashamed and even confounded, / For I bear the reproach of my youth" (31:18-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah Having Mercy on Ephraim</H2><P>Jehovah asked, "Is Ephraim a precious son to Me? / Or a child of My good pleasure?" (v. 20a). Then He went on to say that as often as He has spoken against him, He will surely remember him more. He will surely have mercy on him (v. 20b).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_119.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_121.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Jeremiah and Lamentations &nbsp; pg 120</div><br></body></html>
