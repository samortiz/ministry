   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER TEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 1:"And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"Gave them authority."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This refers to the powers of the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord wants the disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom of the heavens, so He does the things of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verses 2-4:There were twelve apostles divided into six pairs: Simon and Andrew, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew, Thomas and Matthew, James and Thaddaeus, and Simon and Judas.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The arrangement in Luke 6 is a little different because the emphasis there is on the selecting; Luke 9 is on the sending.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter means "a rock."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most likely Bartholomew was Nathanael.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Matthew the tax collector."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only in this Gospel is Matthew specifically designated "the tax collector."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Matthew recorded this in remembrance of his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems that he was writing this with tears.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Betrayed Him" may be rendered "delivered Him up."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some say "Iscariot" is Issachar.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Issachar means "one who is exchanged for a price" Gen 30:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, Judas Iscariot can be rendered "Judas the trader."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Judas was good at doing business; he treated his Teacher as goods.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Iscariot means "a man of Kerioth."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Kerioth was the name of a place in Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Among the twelve apostles, only Judas was from Judea; all the rest were Galileans.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verses 5-6:Their going out this time was to work entirely among the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the Israelites rejected the Lord, He still sent forth His disciples to preach the gospel of the kingdom to them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here "Israel" includes all the twelve tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why does it say "the lost sheep of the house of Israel"?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because in God's eyes, in a sense, Israel is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verses 7-8:"Heal the sick...cast out demons."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These are powers of the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Freely give."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that the spiritual power of the gospel is not sold for money.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verses 9-10:Here the word "sandals" is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The word for "worker" is the same as that in 9:37-38, but it is singular here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 11:"And into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and there remain until you depart."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Who in it is worthy" means "who in it is suitable."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 14:"And whoever does not receive you nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To "shake off the dust from your feet" is to show that you have nothing to do with any place that rejects Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 15:"Truly I say to you, It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This shows us that God's punishment is in varying degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Rejecting Christ will result in a more severe punishment than committing many serious sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord told the disciples to go out without money or bag or sandals or a staff.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This principle applies to going to the house of Israel, not to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The principle of preaching to the Gentiles is "taking nothing from the Gentiles" 3 John 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Either receive the provision from the believers, or provide for your own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This way of going out without money or staff to the house of Israel also has a time limit Luke 22:35-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here, according to the text, we also realize that this is not the principle in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles: 1 Verse 5 clearly says, "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>2 "Find out who in it is worthy" v. 11 . To preach the gospel to the Gentiles is to preach to those who are unworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>3 "If the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it" v. 13 . Since the Gentiles were not yet reconciled to God, how could there be a house for which they could plead peace?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here are several principles that can be applied today to the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles: 1 freely receiving and freely giving, 2 trusting in the Lord to supply our needs, and 3 taking nothing from those who do not receive salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 16:"Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Be therefore prudent as serpents and guileless as doves."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here, the Lord mentioned not only the serpents but also the doves.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord did not say that we should be like serpents; rather, He said that we should be prudent as serpents.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that we should not provoke others in a senseless way that causes us to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be guileless is to be harmless.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The meaning here is that in the midst of the evil ones we need to be prudent, lest we be hurt senselessly; however, neither should we try to make gains for ourselves by hurting others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verses 17-20:The apostles would suffer persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 21: "And brother will deliver up brother to death, and father his child; and children will rise up against their parents and put them to death."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For the sake of the gospel we must break the closest relationships we have on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Because of the Lord's greatness men will rise up against us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 22:"And you will be hated by all because of My name.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There are many people who are hated by others, but how many are hated because of the Lord's name?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If there is no tribulation, there is no joy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is nothing on earth that gives people joy more than tribulations Rom 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If one does not have a heart to obey the Lord, he cannot suffer for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"He who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is very different from Acts 16:31.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The latter is spoken to sinners, the former, to workers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Here, to be saved may mean to be saved from the wicked ones, or it may mean to be saved in the kingdom age, that is, to receive a reward in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here, most probably it refers to receiving the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The three aspects of salvation are: 1 in the present age, 2 in the kingdom age, and 3 in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
