<p>The lot for the children of Joseph went from Jericho to Bethel and to the sea (16:1-4).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Land Allotted to the Children of Ephraim,<br />
the Second Son of Joseph</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. From Jericho<br />
through the River Jordan to the Sea</h2>
<p>The land allotted to the children of Ephraim, the second son of Joseph, went from Jericho through the river Jordan to the sea (vv. 5-8).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. With the Cities in the Midst of the Inheritance<br />
of the Children of Manasseh</h2>
<p>This allotted land was together with the cities with their villages set apart for the children of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children of Manasseh (v. 9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Not Dispossessing the Canaanites<br />
Who Dwelt in Gezer</h2>
<p>The children of Ephraim did not dispossess the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer. Thus, the Canaanites dwelt in the midst of Ephraim and became forced labor (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Land Allotted to Manasseh,<br />
the Firstborn of Joseph</h2>
<p>In 17:1-18 we have an account of the land allotted to Manasseh, the firstborn of Joseph.</p>

<p>Gilead and Bashan, east of the Jordan, were allotted to Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh (vv. 1b, 5b, 6b).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Land Allotted<br />

<p>The land allotted to the rest of the children of Manasseh went south to Ephraim, west to the sea, north to Asher, and east to Issachar (vv. 1a, 2, 5a, 7-10).</p>

<h2 class="head3">4. The Daughters of Zelophehad<br />
Claiming an Inheritance among Their Brothers</h2>
<p>Zelophehad, the fourth generation of Manasseh, had no sons but daughters. His daughters claimed an inheritance among their brothers according to Jehovah&rsquo;s command to Moses (vv. 3-5a, 6a; Num. 27:1-11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Children of Manasseh Being Unable<br />
to Dispossess the Cities in Their Land</h2>
<p>The children of Manasseh were unable to dispossess the cities in their land, but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in the land. When the children of Manasseh became strong, they made the Canaanites forced labor, but they did not utterly dispossess them (Josh. 17:12-13).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. The Children of Joseph Requesting More Land</h2>
<p>The children of Joseph requested more land because they were a numerous people. Joshua encouraged them to dispossess the hill country with its valley, though the Canaanites had chariots of iron and were strong (vv. 14-18).</p>
