   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HIS PERSONAL TESTIMONY GIVEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AT KULANGSU, FUKIEN, OCTOBER 20, 1936</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>During the period between 1921 and 1923, revival meetings were held to lead people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time preaching the gospel was believed to be the unique work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But God opened my eyes to see that His purpose requires that those who have been saved by grace stand upon the ground of oneness in local churches to represent and maintain God's testimony on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of my co-workers had different views of the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when I carefully studied the book of Acts, I realized that God's wish is to establish local churches in each city.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time the light shone upon me so clearly that I recognized that this is His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the same time I received this light, a problem arose with some co-workers who held different views regarding important points of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This resulted in friction among us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They felt that we should be zealous in revival and gospel preaching work and that the fruit of such work could be easily seen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>My view, however, was to establish local churches with less stress on the revival and preaching side.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When an older co-worker went out to hold gospel meetings, as he frequently did, I was at times tempted to secretly hold revival gospel meetings of my own.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, instead of doing this, when he was away, I immediately acted according to the vision I had received.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Upon his return, he would undo what I had done and work according to his concept.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But when he was again absent, I would go back to my previous way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Consequently, we oscillated back and forth on this matter all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the light each of us had received in respect to the work was different, our ways of working were also different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One way was that of revival and evangelism, while the other way was that of establishing local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What the Lord revealed to me was extremely clear: Before long He would raise up local churches in various parts of China.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whenever I closed my eyes, the vision of the birth of local churches appeared....</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord called me to serve Him, the primary objective was not to hold revival meetings, help people hear more scriptural doctrines, or for me to become a great evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord revealed to me that He desired to build up local churches in various places to manifest Himself and to bear the testimony of unity on the ground of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this way, each saint is able to function in the church and live the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What God wants is not individuals trying to be victorious or spiritual; He wants a corporate glorious church presented to Himself.</S>
