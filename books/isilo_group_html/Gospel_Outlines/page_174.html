<h1 class="title">THE HUMAN LIFE HAS NO HOPE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Eph. 2:12</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The situation of man
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Describe how man is born, raised up, encounters sicknesses, and dies. The human life can never depart from these four things: birth, aging, sickness, and death.</li>
	<li>Conclude that everything is vanity.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The hopelessness of the human life
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Use further examples to illustrate that once a man dies, that is the end of everything for him.</li>
	<li>Conclude that the human life is hopeless.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reason for hopelessness
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The reason why the human life is hopeless is that man has lost God. Without God there is no hope.</li>
	<li>God wants to be everything to the human life. Only when man has God will there be hope for his life.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to have hope
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Do not ignore the sense of emptiness. The sense of emptiness tells you that you need God, Who is the hope of life.</li>
	<li>Recognize that God can be everything to the human life.</li>
	<li>Repent and turn to God.</li>
	<li>Receive the Son of God, Jesus Christ. To have the Son of God is the way to have God. Once man has God, his life will be full of hope.</li>
	</ol></li>
