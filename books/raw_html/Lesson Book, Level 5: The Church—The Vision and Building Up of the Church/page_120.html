In the next five lessons, we will clarify our role in the church life so that we may participate in the building up of the church. People come to the church life from various backgrounds. Most of you were born of parents who are in the church. In this lesson, our burden is to reveal how we came into the church. We were not born into the church physically, nor were we invited by a friend, etc.<p>We were chosen before the foundation of the world to be in the church. We were redeemed by Christ on the cross to be in the church. We were raised with Christ and seated in the heavenlies together with Christ for the church. We were regenerated by the Spirit to be in the church. We were born of God to be in the church. We are now sons of God in the household of God. We are members of the Body of Christ to be in the church. We are in the church by life and because of life. We are in the church because of the work of the Triune God. We can never leave the church, nor can we ever be dismissed from the church. We were destined to be in the church. We are in the church. The church is our home for eternity. Hallelujah!
