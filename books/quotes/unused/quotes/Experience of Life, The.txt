Very few people, however, know that this great heart's desire and purpose can only be attained by God's own life
From the point of view of knowing life, regeneration means that in addition to his original life man obtains the life of God
From the standpoint of experience, what, actually, is regeneration, and what are the conditions of regeneration?
It includes forgiveness of sins, cleansing, sanctification, justification, freedom from bondage, regeneration, etc
Regeneration, therefore, is the central part of God's salvation, and it is also the central part of our experience of God's salvation
All our experiences of spiritual life are matters of the new man within us, and this new man begins at the time of our regeneration
The experience of regeneration is especially related to four things: our nature, our heart, our spirit, and God's life
From the aspects of these four things therefore we will look at our condition before regeneration during regeneration and after regeneration
Jeremiah 17:9 says: 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and it is exceedingly corrupt: who can know it'?
We see that before regeneration our original nature is deceitful and crooked, extremely corrupted, and unable to match God's nature
It is at the time of experiencing regeneration, because of the Holy Spirit's enlightenment, that we see ourselves to be corrupt
When we experience regeneration and the Holy Spirit enlightens us, we see ourselves as corrupt, sinning against God and man
When we are being regenerated of the Holy Spirit, our spirit deep within feels contrite- indeed, as if it were broken
Our spirit is dead before regeneration; it is contrite at the time of regeneration; and it is alive unto God after regeneration
If we are clear regarding these few points, we then have a thorough understanding of the experience of regeneration
It is proper therefore that we separate the regeneration and the clearance of the past and consider them as two distinct experiences of life
He said therefore to the Lord that if he had taken anything from any man by false accusation, he would willingly restore him fourfold
Altogether there are four categories: 1) unrighteous matters, 2) improper matters, 3) evil and unclean matters, 4) old ways of living
Unrighteous means that the method by which a certain thing is obtained, or the relationship of a certain matter, is unjust or illegal
Since both gambling and drinking are improper and indecent, the very nature of these things is also improper and indecent
Neither smoking nor reading obscene novels can be said to be unrighteous, but surely they are immoral and improper
; also evil and unclean things, such as worshiping idols, worshiping ancestors, divining, fortune-telling, etc
Whoever receives the Lord's salvation has his old human living wrecked and terminated, and his new human living begun and being built up
Formerly he had extorted money from others and was thus unrighteous; so he put an end to his unrighteous deeds by restoring fourfold
In his former life he put an extreme value upon money; covetousness was his philosophy of life, and loving money was his old way of living
She spoke at that time from Exodus, telling how Pharaoh usurped the Israelites and would not allow them to leave Egypt
It seems difficult to find words to express these changes in taste mood and feeling but they are definitely the result of being regenerated
For those who have more future in their enterprises or more accomplishment in society, the change will be more evident
If these changes are not great enough, we must look for a deeper work of the Holy Spirit to make them stronger and more weighty
Once a man is saved, he will have this change of affection, and it follows that he will have a good ending of the past
Although we have previously pointed out four matters which must necessarily be ended, yet these only enable us to recognize principles
When we are practicing the clearing of the past, what needs to be ended really depends on the sense of life within
Since we have such a new life, we can now live and behave in the presence of God through the sense of this new life
Their 'ending' proves that this matter is not based on external regulations and teachings, but on the sense of life within
These two examples show how these people originally lived in the midst of unclean things without any feeling about them
We need first to cause others to know that the life of God is within them and lead them to know the sense of this life
Once this feeling has begun and has been deepened within them, we can lead them to clear up their past according to their own feeling
We must look to the Lord for grace that we may clear up things more thoroughly, until we are full of life and peace
It is possible that later, when our life has grown and our feeling increased, we will feel there is more which needs to be put to an end
At this time we must again follow the leading of this feeling and deal with these matters until we again sense life and peace
What we have seen in the preceding chapters is the first state of spiritual life, that is, the experience 'in Christ'
Now we will continue by looking at the second stage of the spiritual life, the experience of 'abiding in Christ'
The implication is that in the first stage man has only the Lord's salvation, being regenerated of the Holy Spirit
As to the other experiences of life, they are still very weak and vague to him; so this stage can only be called 'the salvation stage'
He then loves the Lord, pursues the Lord, and gradually obtains the various experiences of life which come after regeneration
Once a man is in Christ, he should abide in Christ-these two events are closely connected and take place almost simultaneously
Originally man lived in the presence of God, but because of his transgression, he became dead and fell into sins
Now because of the Lord's deliverance, he is quickened together with the Lord and raised up together with the Lord
It is abnormal for a man to be saved but not revived, since the central point of salvation is regeneration, that is, revival
Many Christians wait until they are consecrated before they abide in Christ have fellowship with Christ and thus enjoy and experience Christ
Our gospel work must be done strongly to such an extent that people will immediately consecrate themselves as soon as they are saved
When a creditor takes action to obtain payment of debt from someone, it is because the other party is indebted to him
He cannot obtain something in the universe without paying a price, and He also cannot demand something from us without a basis
If you pay three dollars for one of the volumes, then you can demand that the book be turned over to you and claim that it belongs to you
If God, therefore, wanted to release us from under His righteous law, He must pay the full price to satisfy the demand of His law
Since this blood satisfied the requirements of the law we are redeemed from under His righteous law that is we are bought from under the law
Since the day we obtained redemption, we have been released from the rule of the law; we are no longer under its authority
God's right of ownership over us through purchase, therefore, is the basis upon which we should consecrate ourselves to God
When we lead others to consecrate themselves, or when we examine our own consecration, we must attend to this basis of consecration
We must realize that we were bought by God and that the right of ownership over us has been transferred to God
If we were to investigate the consecration experiences of Christians, we would discover that most were constrained by the love of the Lord
Today, we are in the mood to love, so we consecrate ourselves; tomorrow we are not in the mood to love, so we do not consecrate ourselves
Our consecration must not only be because of the love of the Lord; we must realize that God verily has the right to possess us
We were bought by God, and we belong to Him; therefore, whether we like it or not, we cannot but consecrate ourselves and serve Him
For this cause he let God do all the choosing for him and was willing to accept His arrangement, whatever it might be
If the things which God purchased were inanimate objects, such as a chair or a garment, He could proceed directly to use them as He pleases
Romans 12:1 says, 'I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice'
He would cause us to have the motive of love, so that we might consecrate ourselves willingly to God as a living sacrifice
Those who have not had the experience of being constrained by the love of the Lord will not have a consecration that is good and intense
The motive of love must be maintained in us in order that our consecration and service may always be fresh and sweet
When one sees the basis of consecration and also has the motive of consecration, he is willing to consecrate himself to God
Romans 12:1 says, 'I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice'
The principle is this: The bullock originally lived in a corral and was used for plowing the field and drawing carts
When we understand this meaning of consecration, we can then discern the genuineness of the consecration of others
Those who truly offer themselves, therefore, must pass completely out of their own hands and into God's hands for His use
When these were offered as a burnt-offering, they were burnt on the altar and became a sweet savor, food for God
Our consecration today must be made out of our voluntary will; it is we who willingly lie on the altar and dare not move off
Others may calculate and choose between the sweet and the bitter, but when we encounter a difficulty, we dare not consider escape
Since the meaning of consecration is to become a sacrifice, the thing offered is something which is entirely for God
If we do not let God work first, our labor can neither please Him nor be accepted by Him, no matter how diligent and enduring we are
Those things we do for God which are pleasing and acceptable to Him can never go beyond that which we allow God to work
When we consecrate ourselves to God, although it is to work for God, yet from our standpoint the emphasis is to let God work
If the sacrifices were not consumed by fire, they would be raw and foul-smelling and could never be acceptable or pleasing to God
Anyone who has not been dealt with by God and worked on by God and yet tries to work for God directly is offering strange fire
Whenever someone offers himself to God, his purpose is to work for God, but he is either ignorant or neglects to allow God to work first
If our head has not been worked on by God, if it is still in its natural state, it is dangerous to read the Bible
It is extremely dangerous whenever a man comes into direct touch with spiritual things without experiencing the working of God
When a bullock was taken for sacrifice and offered upon the altar, he was immediately cut off from all his previous relationships
All his choicest parts were changed to a sweet smelling savor to God, and all that was left was a heap of ashes
If evidence of this relinquishing of all things and burning to ashes is not seen in a man, there is something wrong with his consecration
The future we are speaking about includes not only our future in this world, but also our future in the so-called Christian world
He lives purely and simply in the hand of God; he is what God wants him to be and does what God wants him to do
If at this time you can face him and tell him straightly, 'Be gone; these are not my portion,' this then is a true giving up of the future
If our consecration is not sound, sooner or later problems will arise in our service and in our spiritual condition
There are many matters, many environments, and many attractions which can cause us to lose our consecration unconsciously
Brothers and sisters, this result of abandoning all our future prospects always needs to be kept fresh within us
After we have gone through the five main points of consecration, we should be quite clear concerning the lesson of consecration
From the standpoint of the truth, we can say that everything pertaining to the doctrine of consecration is included in these five points
We must realize that it is not possible to hit the climax of any experience of life by experiencing it just once
We need to pursue continuously, so that our experience will increase gradually and become fuller, until it reaches the stage of maturity
If we want to enter into a house, we usually need to walk a certain distance, after which we step into the door of the house
In Old Testament times the burnt-offering had to be offered every day, not only in the morning, but also in the evening
If we would consecrate ourselves repeatedly in this way, the experience of consecration would be increased and formed in us
Through the account of her life we see that she was one who was steadfast in her consecration, and one who advanced continually
Consequently, we can clearly distinguish the five points of consecration expressed in her when she was advanced in years
Whenever there was a controversy between her and the Lord, there was a rock under her feet on which she stood continually
The motive of her consecration was just like the mighty force of rushing waters; therefore, her consecration remained sweet and absolute
Although she was sometimes at home serving her husband and caring for her child yet she was one who really remained in the hands of the Lord
On the other hand, in the universe, before God she is ever producing a sweet-smelling savor to His satisfaction and to the joy of His people
As we grow in life, however, these five points related to the experience of consecration gradually become formed in us
Dealing' implies that we follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to purge away all the difficulties which hinder the growth of life
Before we consecrate ourselves, or when we depart from a consecrated position, we do not realize that we need to be dealt with
If we desire to fulfill the purpose of our consecration, we need to have all our difficulties dealt with one by one
After we have consecrated ourselves, we discover that there are more things to be dealt with, and we deal with them more thoroughly
The stronger the consecration, the more severe are the dealings; the truer the consecration, the more thorough are the dealings
Among all the difficulties which need to be dealt with, sins are the crudest, the most defiling, and the most evident
John 1:9, 'If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
Proverbs 28:13, 'He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy'
The dealing with sins of which we are speaking is our dealing with the sins which we commit outwardly, the sins in our actions
Romans 21415 says that those of the nations which have no law are a law to themselves they show the work of the law written in their hearts
Their conscience is the law within them which bears witness, and their thoughts either accuse or else excuse them
These sinful acts always fall short of the glory of God and, in either a perceptible or an imperceptible manner, hurt others
Whenever we commit a sin, we have immediately the fact of sinning not only against God, but many times also against man
On one hand we need to deal with our record of sin before God, and on the other hand we need to deal with the fact of our sinning
Our dealing with sins is based only on the consciousness while in fellowship with God not on all the facts of all the sins we have committed
If we are aware of only ten percent, we deal with ten percent; if we are aware of twenty percent, we deal with twenty percent
If a person is guilty of an unrighteous act, others may become conscious of his wrong doing, but he himself may not be aware of it
He must deal with it quickly until it is completely cleared up; then he can have fellowship once more with God
If one recognizes his sin while in the light of fellowship and does not deal with it, his fellowship is immediately hindered
When we help others to deal with sins, we do not ask them to deal with their unconscious sins, but with their conscious sins
When one becomes aware of his sin and either neglects or refuses to deal with it, then we can help him and lead him to deal with it
We do not ask how many sins we have committed which we have not dealt with, but how many conscious sins we have not dealt with
We can leave our unconscious sins undealt with for the time being, but the conscious ones should be dealt with speedily
The same unrighteous deed may be a sin in the eyes of one person, whereas in the eyes of another it is not a sin
By arranging his bed in such a way he felt that he was pretending; hence, he had sinned and wished to clear it up
The feeling in the same individual may also vary according to the difference in his stage and depth of fellowship
No longer does he wait for others to condemn him; within himself he recognizes the sin and realizes that it must be dealt with
The fact is that the light is not strong enough, so that our vision is not able to pierce the atmosphere and detect the dust
When the sunlight enters the room, under such strong illumination, we may observe many dust particles in the air
Everyone should learn to deal with sins only according to his own consciousness at the time he is in fellowship with the Lord
Not only are all the sins dealt with which need to be dealt with, but they are dealt with in a very thorough manner
What we have said before about dealing with sins thoroughly implies that we deal with sins to such a state of life and peace
His blood satisfied the requirement of God's law on our behalf; therefore, all our record of sin before God has been abolished
John 1:9 says that 'if we confess our sins, he (God forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness'
These words were written by the Apostle to those who are saved, and they refer to all the sins we commit after we are saved
If we become conscious of them in His light, we must confess them before God; then we will be forgiven and cleansed
If we do not confess while here, we will still have to confess in the coming Kingdom before we can obtain forgiveness
In conclusion, we obtain forgiveness for all the sins committed after we have been saved through our confession
If our act of sinning against man involves only a moral matter, we have only to confess this and apologize before man
When we deal with sins before man, there are four basic principles we should remember and by which we should abide
Every sinful act of ours, when become known to others, whether it causes damage to them or not, results in a discordant condition between us
Under this principle, even our forgiving of others and our seeking peace with others are also included in this dealing
Every sin we have committed not only causes disapproval in others but also brings condemnation to our conscience
Not only will it cause others to have a bad impression of us, but it will also cause our conscience to have guilty stains
Each real dealing with sins, therefore, is the issue of the grace of God working in him and is a strong testimony of God's grace
The four principles in dealing with sins which we have mentioned are those to which we should give heed in carrying out these dealings
If the answers to these questions conform to the four principles, we may bravely proceed then to deal with the sin
By not dealing with him regarding this sin, he will have no knowledge of it and will not receive any bad impression of us
When we restore what we have taken, we should pay according to the original value and add a little more to compensate for the loss
With regard to the amount to be added, we may be guided by our inner feeling and our financial situation at the time
If we can afford it, we should see that the reimbursement fully repays the loss of those whom we owe, and that we also have peace within
All human needs on this earth are supplied by God; therefore, when we give money to the poor, it is the same as giving to God
Whenever God enlightens us, we should be willing to deal with our sin, whatever it may be, not caring for our face or counting the loss
When we have reached such a stage, we can say that the purpose of God in having us deal with sins is accomplished
Since dealing with sins has such a close relationship with our spiritual life, we should endeavor to experience this lesson continuously
Although this experience is not a deep one, yet no one can be so spiritual as to say that they have no need to deal with sins
There was a young believer who came to inquire of a servant of God concerning how to grow in his spiritual life
Dealing with the world is very important in the initial experience of our Christian life; therefore, we shall study it carefully
The damage caused by sin and the world upon man differ greatly: sin contaminates man, whereas the world both contaminates and possesses man
If Satan only uses sin to defile man he can only cause man to be corrupted but if he uses the world to usurp man he can gain man for himself
Demas, a co-worker of Paul, was deprived of his usefulness before God because he loved the present world and became usurped by it
For this reason he has a little knowledge concerning sin, that which is against morality, and is conscious of its contamination
As for the world, which is in opposition to God, he has no knowledge of it, neither is he conscious of its usurpation
When calling people to follow Him the Lord stressed the fact that man should forsake houses lands brothers sisters parents wife children etc
If we desire to grow in life and be gained by the Lord, we must make an effort to deal with the world that enslaves us
Since the world opposes God and has such harmful effect upon man, we must consider its origin and process of development
At the creation of man, there were only the universe, the heaven and earth, and all things; the world did not exist
When Adam was in the Garden of Eden, various kinds of fruit and vegetables, water, air, sunshine, and a place for shelter were provided
Today, man needs self-protection and self-defense, but in the beginning God Himself was his defense and protection
All the trees in the Garden of Eden not only bore fruit for food, but were also pleasing and enjoyable to the eye, making one happy
Adam in the Garden of Eden had no need to worry, plan, or prepare anything for himself, for God was responsible for everything
When man lost God's care for his livelihood, he first experienced fear; he feared the lack of supply, defense, and happiness
In order to meet the necessities of life and survive, man used his own strength and devised means of supply, defense, and amusement
After the fall of Cain, out of his descendants were produced the founders of man's own supply for these three great needs of life
When mankind lived a godless life, Satan immediately disguised himself and utilized these avenues as a means to possess man
The entire human life is completely usurped by these requirements, and man totally disregards God and His will
In the beginning, these various forms of occupations involving man's livelihood seemed rather trivial, scattered and unsystematized
Later, Satan organized these into a more tangible and systematized world, thus entangling mankind in a tighter web
A man requires food for his existence, but when he is engrossed in labor in order to earn enough to feed himself, he is already possessed
Gradually, man has become heavily bound and thoroughly possessed by these systems and can find no way of escape
When people, activities, or things-whether good or bad, beautiful or ugly-enslave man, they comprise the world
One by one these courses enslave and possess man causing him to completely forsake and forget God and go along with the current of the world
The world denotes the enemy's scheme, system, and organization to usurp the place of God in man and finally to gain full possession of man
Verse 17 in the Greek says that 'the things that are in the world passeth away, but he that does the will of God abideth forever'
The part of the world which Cain contacted was the age of Cain; the part of the world which Abraham contacted was the age of Babel
The world is the entire organization used by Satan to usurp man, while an age is a fraction of this organization
age' means 'modern,' 'fashion,' 'the course,' the world which is revealed before us today, or the things that are in the world
We cannot contact the world in its entirety, but only a portion of it, called the 'age' or 'the things that are in the world'
We see that the world is in opposition to God, and the age or the things that are in the world are in opposition to the will of God
The first world began with the city of Enoch built by Cain; the second world began with the city of Babel after the flood
The first world, beginning with Cain, developed and prospered gradually, until it reached its peak during the time of Noah
In position, the human race was completely submerged in the world; its condition was vile, sinful and utterly corrupted
Only the eight members of Noah's family were saved, while the remainder of the first world was wiped out by the flood
The first world was an all-inclusive mixture, but the second definitely branched into three lines, each representing one aspect of the world
The Bible records several occasions in which the children of God went down into Egypt to solve their problems of livelihood
They compassed the land of Canaan, the rightful position of God's elect, and posed a snare to engulf the children of Israel
Today these three worlds are in like manner destroying the church which the Lord chose and called out for Himself
Has she not even been captured and taken into the idolatrous world of Babylon and has thus been filled with the idols of the world?
The judgment of the flood consummated the first world, and the judgment of fire will consummate the second world
That will be the final fall of God's chosen race, wherein they will be corrupted and possessed by Satan to the uttermost
The Bible divides the history of the human race into two parts: Genesis 1 through 11:26 and Genesis 11:27 to the end of Revelation
Although after the call of Abraham there were histories of the created race, they were not recorded as the main subject of the Bible
In the first part, Satan employed the first world to possess the created race; then Satan used the second world to possess the chosen race
The second world was fully ripened in Egypt, because it was there that Satan possessed the entire chosen race, the Israelites
In conclusion, Satan employed two worlds in order to possess two races, which bring forth two judgments of God
In the process of the world's development, a great majority of those prepared by God for Himself have become possessed by Satan
With the tent and the altar, they bear a direct testimony against the city, which is the symbol and center of the world
In the first world, Noah was the first man who lived a tent life in direct opposition to the city life of the world
The first overcomer was delivered out from the world and lived in a tent as an opposing testimony against the city, the world's symbol
In the second world there have been many who have lived in tents and have borne an opposing testimony against the world
Upon his arrival in Egypt both his tent and his altar vanished therefore his testimony against the world and his service to God disappeared
After their deliverance from Egypt and their arrival in the wilderness, they observed the tent life and the service of the altar
Later, when there were overcomers among the Israelites, they set their faces toward Jerusalem and recovered Jerusalem
At the end of the New Testament the Great Babylon will be destroyed , and on the other hand the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven
At the end we still see the tent, the symbol of the overcomers, as an opposing testimony against the city, which represents the world
The tent, erected in the wilderness, that is, outside the world, represents the pilgrim life outside of the world
Those who live in the tent signify that they are not submerged in the world; rather, they lead a sojourner's life outside the world
Since the world possesses God's children and destroys God's purpose, God saves man in two aspects: from sin and from the world
Salvation from sin delivers us only from our fallen state, whereas salvation from the world delivers us from our fallen position
When we preach the gospel, we give much attention to deliverance from sin, but we seldom speak about deliverance from the world
In the Old Testament, the salvation of God is seen in two important types: the ark of Noah and the exodus from Egypt
The Passover denotes their deliverance from Gods judgment of death the Red Sea denotes their deliverance from the ruling power of the world
Noah's family was saved through the flood which destroyed the world and thus was delivered from the corrupted world
His ascent from the water denotes his separation from the world and his new position relative to the life of the tent and the altar
In this manner we shall be delivered from being possessed by the world and be a people living completely unto God by the way of the altar
We can say that anything that goes beyond our daily necessities is taking the place of God and possessing us thus it needs to be dealt with
Both may be saved and have Christ as their life, but because each is born in a different family, their occupations and environments differ
Even though 1 Timothy 2:9 forbids the adornment of costly raiment, it is a matter of principle, not a detailed, rigid rule
They said that no one could attend the meeting wearing leather shoes, but all must wear Chinese shoes made of cloth
The men were required to shave their heads and the women were required to wear skirts otherwise they were not allowed to attend the meeting
The standard of our living necessities must be determined by ourselves through prayer and seeking the mind of God
We cannot measure our standard according to that of others nor demand that they agree with our views and feelings
Some people deal with their living necessities, things which do not usurp them, as if they were worldly, and thus go to the extreme
Although any excess beyond our necessities constitutes the world, it does not mean that all living necessities may not become the world
Without a doubt, the emphasis in dealing with the world is on dealing with the usurpation of people, activities, and things
Our daily necessities may or may not usurp us, but anything exceeding our daily necessities definitely usurps us
If a person, activity, or thing is separated unto God and for God, the Bible also calls it holy, being separated unto holiness
When chosen and placed upon the altar, however, they become an offering unto God, being separated unto holiness
When God and all that is in Him enter into us we are of Him directly which in turn causes all things belonging to us to be of Him indirectly
Although a believer's wife and children are not saved, they are sanctified, because they are directly of him and indirectly of God
The husband is of God directly, but his unsaved wife and children are of God indirectly by virtue of their relationship to him
Perhaps, we are of God one-hundred percent, but only forty percent unto God, and only five percent truly used by God
We see from the above that all that relates to God, all that is of God, all that is unto God, and all that is for God is holy
After they are saved, he must help them to consecrate themselves to God that they may be unto God and be used by God
In conclusion, the objects of our dealing with the world include all things not pertaining to God, not of God, not unto God, and not for God
It includes anything that takes God's place in us, as well as all people, activities, and things which exceed our living necessities
God has never asked an individual to separate himself in a moment's time from all unholiness and all things which usurp him
Practically speaking, there may be one hundred unholy things in us, but during our fellowship we become conscious, perhaps, of only ten
Not until we have attained to a greater degree of fellowship in life do we become conscious of the remaining objects and deal with them
2)We should gradually broaden the area of our fellowship so that our inner feeling touches all aspects of our life
3)We should gradually deepen our fellowship so that our inner feeling concerning the world deepens; thus, we may deal more thoroughly
By comparison, the one whose life is matured and whose knowledge toward God is increased has deeper feelings toward the world
If our vision is as narrow as the opening of a well, then the sky we see will be no larger than the opening of the well
Whenever we deal with the world which we are conscious of, we should deal with it until we have peace and life within
Since these dealings are based upon the feelings of life which are derived from fellowship, they are experiences of life
Dealing with the world causes us to experience life and sense the freshness, brightness, satisfaction, strength, joy, and peace of life
If we wish to practice dealing with the world, we should pay our attention to one point-that is, to close our mind to the world
In conclusion, when we endeavor to deal with the world, we should be determined and violent to shut out any thoughts of the world
After man fell by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, he felt ashamed of his nakedness
Although the function of the conscience was not made manifest before the fall, nevertheless the conscience itself already existed
We may liken this to an infant who is born with the organ of the brain, but who later unfolds the brain's function by education
Not until after the fall did the concept of good and evil enter into man, and thereby the function of his conscience was manifested
His newly activated conscience enabled him to sense and differentiate between right and wrong, good and evil, in every phase of his life
Directly after the fall although the fellowship and intuition of the spirit became withered and insensitive the conscience became activated
When we are saved and regenerated, the Holy Spirit enters into us and quickens our spirit, giving us a new spirit
The functions of the spirit today are not the same as they were after the fall, neither are they similar to their condition before the fall
The conscience enables us to know both what God justifies and what He condemns , what He delights in and what He hates
God set up the conscience within fallen man that man might govern himself according to these principles and laws
Since the soul surrounds the spirit, the conscience is also closely related to the parts of the soul, the mind and emotion and will
Positionally speaking, the conscience is closely related to all our inward parts-namely, spirit, soul, and heart
Since the intuition is adjacent to the conscience, its function affects to a large extent the function of the conscience
When a person's fellowship with God is free, without any hindrance, the function of his conscience is also keen and accurate
The deeper his fellowship is with God, the livelier and brighter he is within, and his conscience becomes more keen and accurate
A clear, understanding mind, a rich, balanced emotion, and a strong, pliable will greatly affect the function of the conscience
In order to acquire a conscience which functions normally, our mind, emotion, and will must be guided into their proper course
Of the three kinds of government, the one which is under the rule of self is the one related to the conscience
Unfortunately, man failed under God's rule and became sinful within and without; so the holy and righteous God had to leave man
Because man was neither subject to God's rule nor obedient to self-rule, God authorized man to represent Himself in ruling over man
From the point of view of government, man's fall was a fall from God's rule to self-rule, and then from self-rule to man's rule
The more one is ruled by God, the nobler he becomes, but the more one is ruled by man, the more base he becomes
They are restrained in all their utterances and behavior, not because of their fear of man, but because of the ruling of their conscience
Students must be controlled by their teachers, children by their parents, and business personnel by their supervisors
Only severe dealings with our conscience will deliver us from the fallen condition of human rule to that rule by the conscience
If we remain only in the feelings of conscience, we are still in a half-fallen situation and fall short of God's will
When we live by the intuition and are controlled by the intuition, we are living in the presence of God and ruled by Him
It condemns all that is wrong and all that is evil, but it does not necessarily approve all that is right and all that is good
These differences between the conscience and the intuition are also the differences between self-rule and God's rule
In the chapter concerning dealing with sin we have said that the basis of dealing with sin is the inner consciousness
In the chapter concerning dealing with the world we have said that the basis for dealing with the world is also the inner consciousness
If we love other matters or are occupied with anything outside of God, the conscience will also give us a feeling of condemnation
There are certain matters that are neither sinful nor of the world, yet they cause our conscience to lose the feeling of peace
If someone scatters clothing and other articles around, leaving the room in a state of disorder, his conscience will rebuke him
In the early stage of dealing with the conscience, our inner feelings are more or less sensitive toward sin and the world
The more severely and thoroughly we deal with our conscience, the more this third category of feeling is increased
Our emphasis in dealing with the conscience is upon the issue of our coming to deal with this third category of feeling
He only has a feeling concerning sin, a feeling of right and wrong, good and evil; and even this feeling is quite dull
The keener one's conscience is and the more one lives in the presence of God, the easier it will be for him to have a feeling of offense
When one's conscience has this feeling of offense, his fellowship with God is hindered and thus his entire spiritual condition is lowered
When our conscience feels we have wronged it will on one hand represent man to accuse us and on the other hand represent God to condemn us
When the feeling of offense in our conscience disappears, the accusation and condemnation of the conscience will naturally vanish
When the conscience goes through severe dealings, its feeling becomes keen, even to the point of being sensitive
If our conscience has not been dealt with to the point of its becoming sensitive, then that dealing is not thorough enough
Some deal so thoroughly with their conscience that they feel convicted should their speech or actions be just slightly off color
Such persons, when gained by the Lord, deal thoroughly with their conscience, purging away all its darkness and wrong doings
Like the skin of our body, some parts are calloused and dull in feeling, while other parts are tender and keen in feeling
If the conscience is dealt with so much that it becomes over-sensitive, it produces a feeling of offense in everything
In many matters such a one condemns himself even before God has condemned him; he loses his peace even before God has disallowed anything
If the matter still remains in you and you continue to feel uneasy and condemned, it is a sign of a weak conscience
Another condition is related to certain sins which need not be dealt with, yet your conscience requires you to deal with them also
Now that he is saved he tries to deal with this situation, but when he does so he finds it difficult to decide what amount to pay back
According to the principle of the Old Testament he should add one-fifth to the original amount, yet he feels this is insufficient
A sensitive conscience, which comes from a thorough dealing with the conscience, usually becomes a weak conscience
When the conscience has been dealt with so that it becomes sensitive, then certainly it will become over-sensitive and weak
When we follow the Lord and deal severely with our conscience, we must try by all means to avoid this weak condition
When our conscience becomes sensitive, we must exercise our will to hold it in place lest it go too far and thus become weak and restless
The accusation or condemnation of the conscience is always based upon definite fact, either sin, the world, or other matters
He reminds us again of certain things which have already been dealt with in the past, thus causing us to lose our peace
He was attacked to such an extent that he should not sleep on his bed, but on the floor; otherwise, he would have no peace within
Revelation 12:10-11 tells us that Satan accuses us day and night before God, but that we can overcome him by the blood of the Lamb
John 17 9 tells us that if we confess our sins God will forgive our sins and the blood of the Lord will cleanse us from all unrighteousness
If we have dealt accordingly with all the feeling of offense in our conscience before the Lord, we must hide under the blood through faith
To the degree the enlightenment of the Holy Spirit attains, to the same degree will be the feeling of our conscience
Whatever the Holy Spirit demands of us through our conscience can also be adequately met by the supply of the power of our life
Sometimes the condition becomes abnormal: the conscience produces a kind of feeling which cannot be adequately met by the degree of life
Since this kind of feeling cannot be adequately met by the growth of life, then it must have come from a premature knowledge
On one hand, he feels that he should not do a certain thing because, if he does, his conscience will feel condemned and uneasy
Later a brother tells him that this bad habit is not pleasing to the Lord and that he must get rid of it immediately
Finally, the new convert is convinced and compels himself to obey these truths that he may get rid of the bad habit
Since the leakage of the conscience is such a serious matter, we must strive to avoid it in the pathway of pursuing the growth of life
As time goes by, the feelings of their conscience will spontaneously increase, and their dealings will also increase accordingly
While we are hiding under the blood, we should have another attitude: we must look to the Lord for the supply of His grace
At the same time our inward parts were all renewed the function of the conscience was restored and the feeling of the conscience was revived
If a certain kind of knowledge precedes our growth in life, it is premature and intellectual; it is not real spiritual knowledge
From this we can see the absolute relatedness of real spiritual knowledge, growth of life, and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit
It is a feeling in our spirit, the deepest part of our being, whereby we sense by inner revelation what needs to be dealt with
The fact is that the concept of this second sister concerning modern dress is merely the result of mental knowledge mixed with emotion
She senses the finger of the Lord pointing to her stylish dress and giving her a feeling that she can never wear that dress again
Each time God gives us spiritual knowledge He desires us to meet the shining light of His face and to sense the revealing of the Holy Spirit
Because of the different degrees of growth in life among the brothers and sisters, the enlightening of the Holy Spirit also differs
These three-spiritual knowledge, the degree of growth in life, and the enlightening of the Holy Spirit-are related and mingled together
Anyone learning to deal with the conscience needs to learn the lesson of receiving the supply of God's grace in faith
Every time the feeling in the conscience brings forth a demand, we ought to realize that this is God's supply for us
We should be grateful to the Lord that even our believing and obeying are also God-given; they do not necessitate our striving or struggling
Normally, when a feeling of the conscience corresponds to the growth in life, we spontaneously have faith and submit in obedience
In conclusion, to fulfill the demand of the feeling in the conscience, we certainly need God's supply of grace
When we fulfill in faith the demand which is in the feeling of our conscience, immediately God's grace comes to supply us
1)First Timothy 1:19, 'Holding a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith'
The good conscience mentioned by the Apostle means a conscience that deals with all blemishes in order to maintain a blameless condition
Among the Gentiles, a moral man may respect the feeling in his conscience, but the evil man is void of feeling in his conscience
On the other hand, if he has little prayer and lacks fellowship with the Lord, the feeling in his conscience is insensitive
Although this feeling of life comes from the life of God and the Holy Spirit, it is through the conscience that we sense it
The extent of our dealing with the conscience is the same as that of dealing with sin and the world-'life and peace'
Not only do we need to feel restful, secure, and assured, but we must also feel strengthened, enlightened, and satisfied
After a period of time, we may again feel empty and confused, uneasy and insecure, as if the feeling of life and peace were gone
One is our carelessness and failure, which has caused us to become contaminated again and possessed of things not pleasing to God
When the light on the matter becomes clear, our vague feeling concerning the lack of life becomes a definite feeling of unrest
In some cases people have been so deceived by him that they have felt obliged to deal unnecessarily, thereby suffering spiritual loss
We must recognize a standard to gauge all our dealings and measure carefully all the feelings that lack life and peace
The standard of our dealing with the world is whether or not we are slavishly possessed by the world in our daily living
If he has no peace when carrying his Bible in his hand, but he has peace when it is on his shoulder, this lack of peace is nonsense
In this second stage of our spiritual life, we have studied consecutively the three lessons of dealing: sin, the world, and the conscience
Everything that requires dealings in the initial stages of the Christian pursuing the Lord are included in these three lessons
After a Christian deals with sin, the justification which he receives from God is lived out through him and is also manifested before men
The more he accepts these dealings, the more blessed is his spiritual condition before God, and the more rapid is his growth in life
If everyone deals strictly and severely in their daily lives, the condition of the meetings will change greatly and become very living
The more we neglect the dealings, the more our inner feeling will become indifferent to our being left in darkness
Whenever we discover new mistakes or things not yet dealt with in the past, we must immediately deal with them
If we desire to follow the Lord in the way of life, we should have a thorough knowledge and experience of this lesson
The anointing of 1 John 2:27 in the original Greek is not a noun, but a verb pertaining to a certain kind of motion
When the Lord Jesus received the Holy Spirit at His baptism He said clearly that the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he anointed me
The ointment which we receive from the Lord undoubtedly points to the Holy Spirit which we have received of Him
In the past we realized that to be sanctified means separation of the anointed one from what is common, thereby causing him to belong to God
If we have a deeper comprehension, we will see that to be sanctified not only changes the position but also the nature of the anointed one
Due to the application of the ointment, God the Creator became mingled and united with men and things, the creatures
In conclusion, the anointing means the Triune God, through the moving of the Holy Spirit within us, anointing Himself into us
The more this ointment anoints us the more God will be increased in us bringing a greater and deeper mingling and uniting of Himself with us
The Word was God , and flesh denotes man; therefore, when the Word became flesh, it means that God became man and mingled Himself with man
The death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus made it possible for Him to have another form, namely, the Holy Spirit
After He passed through death and resurrection, ascended to heaven, descended to earth again and entered into man, He is the Spirit
As the Father expressed Himself in the Son through the incarnation so the Son expressed Himself as the Spirit through death and resurrection
The third step which God used to achieve the purpose of His salvation was the entering of the Holy Spirit into man
When we put these various expressions together, we see that the Spirit of God being in us also means that both Christ and God are in us
Throughout the entire lifetime of a Christian, all the work of the Holy Spirit upon him is to fulfill the work of mingling God with man
The outward discipline is to break us, while the inward mingling is to anoint God into us so that God may increase in us
The more the Holy Spirit anoints us, the more God can mingle with us, and the more He can fulfill His purpose of salvation upon us
If we paint the room continuously, it will become mingled with the gold paint, and the whole room will take on a golden hue
When the Holy Spirit comes into us as the anointing, there is a compounding reaction which causes both to be mingled as one
The experience of the anointing in our spiritual life has more to do with the anointing itself than with the teaching
Even in 1 John 2:27, where the teaching of the anointing is mentioned, no emphasis is placed on the matter of our having peace
The purpose of the flowing of life is to flow God into us, while the purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us
People often speak about the fellowship of life and also about the anointing mentioned in 1 John, but very few connect these two together
When 1 John mentions the fellowship of life, the anointing is inevitable, because the anointing is for the fellowship of life
In Old Testament times, three groups of people were required to be anointed: the priests, the kings, and the prophets
Of these three groups, the kings were sent from God to men to rule for Him, and the prophets were sent from God to men to speak for Him
The anointing is necessary in order to enter into the presence of God, to have fellowship with God, and to be mingled with God
His Epistles reveal that such a God, who was manifested, came into our midst, and entered into us, is eternal life
Once this life is preached to us and received by us, it brings us back into the fellowship of the Father and His Son Jesus Christ
When God came to man, He brought with Him His grace; when we received this grace and returned to Him, we met His love
The purpose of the anointing is to anoint God into us, that we may have fellowship with God and be mingled and united with God
The purpose of the blood is to cleanse all the areas which are incompatible with God and to remove all the situations which do not match Him
The relationship between the anointing and the applying of the blood is also seen very clearly in the Old Testament
When a priest intends to apply the ointment to a leper at the time of his cleansing, the blood must first be applied
The blood is required to wash away all iniquity in order that the anointing may subsequently bring in the fellowship with God in life
The teaching does not come from the ointment or the Holy Spirit, but from the anointing of the ointment, or the moving of the Holy Spirit
When the anointing is moving within us, on the one hand, it anoints God into us, and on the other hand, it reveals God's mind to us
Since the ointment is the Holy Spirit and God Himself, when this ointment anoints us, it anoints us with the components of God
Once we have the feeling of the anointing within us, our mind is able to comprehend some part of God's mind in this feeling of the anointing
In this teaching, we and the Holy Spirit remain two separate entities, having no relationship of mingling whatsoever
In such a revelation God and His will were separated; man could only know God's will, but could not gain God Himself
In the New Testament, God reveals His will to man in Himself; in order to know the will of God, man must first have God Himself
He may go again, but after he is seated something within him will bother him so much that he can no longer stay there
Later, when he is on his way to the movies again, something within him will trouble him continuously and thus prevent him from going
Should we obey the teaching of the anointing even twenty out of one hundred times, we would be the best Christians
In conclusion, when we mention this lesson of the teaching of the anointing, our purpose is to stress the matter of the anointing
Although the teaching of the anointing comes from the anointing; nevertheless, these two occupy different parts in our being
The teaching of the anointing includes only the portion which our mind is capable of understanding; thus, the scope is much narrower
There are also many times when the anointing must pass through our mind and be understood before it can manifest its function
They need to pass through the interpretation of the mind and become the teaching of the anointing; then we can understand the meaning
The teaching of the anointing is the interpretation and understanding of the mind with regard to the anointing in the spirit
The importance of our mind comprehending the feeling of the anointing can be illustrated by the case of one going to the movies
He does not realize that the sanctifying Spirit within him is forbidding this, and that the anointing is teaching him not to go again
The majority of movies are filthy, for they describe, represent, and advocate the evils of an adulterous generation
At this time, not only has his spirit experienced the anointing, but his mind has learned to understand the teaching of the anointing
The feeling of the conscience and the teaching of the anointing are both derived from the feeling of the anointing
The feeling of the conscience which is derived from the anointing is also limited to right and wrong, good and evil
The teaching of the anointing, which comes by way of the anointing and is sensed directly in our spirit, is related in scope to God Himself
We must go beyond this to live in the teaching of the anointing; then we can touch the mind of God and live in God
The main purpose of the teaching of the anointing is that we may touch God, possess God, and understand the mind of God
If we obey the teaching of the anointing, we will thereby eliminate the necessity for the feeling of the conscience
When the executive department operates smoothly, there is no need for the judicial department to take any action
Whenever the executive organ loses its effectiveness or steps beyond its power, the judicial then exercises its power of impeachment
The teaching of the anointing is always a positive move, while the feeling of the conscience is always a negative impeachment
In other words, the Holy Spirit as ointment first anoints the intuition of our spirit in order to guide or prohibit us
At the most, it may seem to be a spoken word as well as a feeling, but it can never be a clearly and definitely spoken sentence
It may be likened to a certain kind of color, which evidently is not a spoken word, but a display which can be known when seen
When we live in the presence of the Lord and have fellowship with Him, the Holy Spirit as the ointment gives an unveiling to our feeling
If our mind has been educated with the proper knowledge, we can understand the meaning of this unveiling and thereby obtain the teaching
If he seeks a sentence as an answer from the Lord, it is impossible, for glasses are not mentioned in the Bible
Many who learn this lesson of the teaching of the anointing still like to seek reassuring words and obtain verbal confirmation
When we pray and commit a matter to the Lord and sense inward peace and sweet fellowship, we know that the Lord agrees with the matter
When we pray about this matter and feel hindered, or whenever we think about it, we feel uneasy, this signifies that the Lord does not agree
Often our inward feeling is influenced by outward matters, but these outward influences still need the response from the inward anointing
Since the teaching of the anointing is so subjective, many times the feeling which comes from the teaching appears to be our own feeling
It is because this feeling which comes from the Holy Spirit within us passes through us and is mingled with us thus giving us this feeling
When our fellowship with the Lord is recovered, this kind of feeling, which seemingly is our own feeling, reappears
The teaching of the anointing is natural and not forced; neither is it something which is purposely sought after
If we need to pray for three days before we are clear about buying it, this proves an abnormal condition exists in our spiritual life
We may pray and wait specifically for an answer, but the Holy Spirit will still make the will of God known to us in a natural way
Since the teaching of the anointing is constant, we should experience it frequently and live in it consistently
We can use these results to measure and judge whether any of our inner feelings are from the teaching of the anointing
Concerning the teaching of the anointing, the Holy Spirit attends to the anointing, and we take care of the obedience
If there is no obedience, it is difficult to have the experience of this lesson; therefore, we will also look into this matter of obedience
We often speak about the spiritual life as walking according to the spirit, living in fellowship, or living in the presence of God
We have already seen that the teaching of the anointing is the feeling generated by the moving of the Holy Spirit within us
To follow the Lord means to follow the Spirit, which, specifically speaking, means to obey the teaching of the anointing
As life is in the Holy Spirit, so the fellowship of life is through the moving or anointing of the Holy Spirit
If our fellowship with the Lord is limited only to our time of private prayer or morning watch, it is still very shallow
If we obey the teaching of the anointing constantly, we can constantly experience the anointing and live in fellowship
It is not difficult to experience the anointing and obey its teaching, because its characteristic is constant and natural
By natural we mean that we automatically have the anointing without requesting it, and constant means that it is always available
If we obey the teaching of the anointing the result is constant fellowship with the Lord in a very natural way this is living in fellowship
Our whole being should cease from all outward activity and movement in order to turn within and give full attention to the inner feeling
If we are busy with outward activities, it is impossible for us to take care of the inner feeling of the anointing
Being zealous for the Lord, they carry their Bibles and run to meet the outward need while neglecting the feeling within
The beginner, learning how to fellowship with the Lord, should set aside several fixed times each day to practice this fellowship
After we spend quite a period of time in practicing fellowship at specific times, we should practice fellowship with the Lord at all times
Appointed times of fellowship are possible by laying aside all outward activities and by praying and seeking wholeheartedly after the Lord
To obey the teaching of the anointing means to walk according to the spirit, live in fellowship, and live in the presence of God
As for the Holy Spirit, He anoints and moves within our spirit; hence, we need to walk according to the spirit
As for the Lord, He lives within us and becomes our life that we may have the flow of life; hence, we need to live in fellowship with Him
Without the anointing, the presence of God cannot be made real within us, and we cannot feel the light from His face
We have already said that the function of the anointing in letting us know what to do and what not to do is secondary
On the other hand, if there is the presence of God, we feel inwardly watered; the more we speak, the more we are satisfied
It is just like the Lord Jesus, who after He finished His talk with the Samaritan woman, was inwardly satisfied
Another example is that when planning to go somewhere, we should ask not only whether we should go, but also whether God is with us
The element of God within them was of a limited measure, and after a few years His element within them remained the same
Since the anointing is vital to God's presence, we need to obey the teaching so we can experience more of the anointing
We can live at all times and in all places in the presence of God living in the light of His face and touching His presence moment by moment
The teaching of the anointing is truly the center of all spiritual experience and is also a very wonderful part of God's salvation
The purpose of the anointing is to anoint the substance of God into us that we may reach the goal of the mingling of God with man
At the same time, the will of God is too great a matter and can never be discussed merely as a part of the teaching of the anointing
Colossians 1:9, 'That ye may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding'
Christians often mention the will of God in relation to trivial affairs, such as their occupation and marriage
When we carefully study the will of God throughout the New Testament, we discover that it points to matters great and lofty
When the Holy Spirit speaks of the will of God in chapter 1, it again must refer to the extremely great matters
The Lord wants the will of God done in heaven to be accomplished on earth-again this is of ultimate importance
These Scriptures speak of Gods will as originating from God and coming to us both from eternity to the present time and from heaven to earth
We cannot separate the will of God from the desire of God's heart; neither can we separate the will of God from God Himself
As another example, when we offer money on the Lord's day, we should not only ask, 'Is this offering God's will'?
Whenever we feel the inner anointing and the presence of God, we are in God's will; otherwise, we are not in God's will
If we want to understand the will of God, the preliminary requirement is that we must know the eternal plan of God
When we are clear about these matters, then we are qualified to touch the will of God and ascertain what His will is for us today
He desires a group of people for the building up of the Body of Christ and a corporate man to be the mystical Bride of His Son
If we touch the plan of God and place ourselves into the plan of God in this manner, we are taking God's economy as our career
When we engage in business, teach, or whatever we do, we are for God's economy; our entire living and all our actions are for His economy
We shall have the ground and qualification to touch God's will and be clear about His guidance regarding all the affairs of our daily life
They are like a book for us to study; hence, we must search out and discover why God needed to create all things in heaven and on earth
If we thoroughly study the matter of creation, the magnitude of God's will in this universe will be understood to a certain degree
In another instance the psalmist of Psalm 19 discovered that although this universe uttered no speech and no words yet their voice is heard
Everyone who loves God and pursues after Him must at some time be brought to the place where he can comprehend God's will in the universe
He will indeed be able to say as the writer in Psalm 8, 'O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth'!
We regret to say that today many brothers and sisters have never read the creation of God in order to know God's will
Does God's will deal with our eating and clothing, our marriage and occupation, our healing and peaceful living?
If our eyes have been opened by the Lord, we will see that our common talk about the will of God has nothing to do with God Himself
The strange thing is that today's Christians are occupied with many things that are not mentioned in the Bible
To come out of himself and understand the eternal and lofty will of God, he must study God's creation carefully
God promised Abraham that he would become a great nation and that his descendants would be as the sand upon the seashore
Although Job was repeatedly stricken by the hand of God, he failed to realize God's intention because he was completely in himself
The Bible as God's Word tells us thoroughly and clearly what God desires to do in the universe and what His purpose is
In the beginning we read about God creating the heavens and the earth, and at the end about the new heaven and new earth
The universe should first be studied that our heart may be enlarged; then the Bible should be studied that our view may be broadened
When speaking of God's creation, we emphasize the sun, moon, stars, all things in heaven and on earth, and the vastness of His creation
When we speak of environment we are referring to our immediate surroundings including people things and circumstances which affect our lives
The political situation has now changed, and people out of all the different provinces have been gathered in Taiwan before our very eyes
If we helped these people to be saved, would they not spread the gospel to all China upon their return to their provinces?
If our heart is not new, our spirit in not keen, and our mind is not clear, we will be greatly hindered in the understanding of God's will
The men whom God has greatly used throughout the generations are those in whom these three organs have been renewed made keen and made clear
All the previous four means by which we understand God's will are entirely dependent upon the working of the Holy Spirit
Dreams and visions mentioned in the Bible are included in the category of the Holy Spirit and will not be listed separately
He has placed us in the very center of His plan that we may have a position in the Body of His Son and become His members
Regrettably many brothers and sisters not only have failed to give attention to these five means but they do not have any knowledge of them
What the Bible mentions is His lofty and eternal will, which can only be understood by those who know these five categories
We need to study all of our surroundings and the world situation as well in order to understand the will of God in this present time
Regarding the heart, spirit, and mind, we must first ask God to give us a heart to love Him, be drawn to Him, and long for Him
Our condition should always be right before the Lord so that the Holy Spirit can speak and reveal Himself to us
It is only by the Holy Spirit that God manifests the meaning of the universe and reveals the truths of the Bible to us
He is oblivious to what God desires to do in this universe and never inquires into the purpose of God's salvation for him
Apparently, he seems to be seeking God's will but actually he is wishing that God's will would fulfill his own satisfaction
These people can only understand their own will and not the will of God; much less can they understand His lofty and eternal will
If one desires to know God's will, he must first put himself and his all on the altar as a consecrated sacrifice to God
In the first stage, consecration is usually the result of our being touched and constrained by the Lord's love
Since the consecration in this primary stage is mostly a matter of the emotion, it changes according to our mood
Man must see God's need concerning His plan and work and consecrate himself to God; then he has the ground to understand God's will
Because our being exists in the body, we must present the body so that our whole being may be given over to God in a practical way
Many people have a heart to consecrate themselves, but because their physical body has not been offered, their consecration is useless
Before we were consecrated to God, we were like a wild ox or sheep living in the mountain wilds; we acted completely by our own will
Only when we become a living sacrifice to God do we cease from our own activities in order to await God's command
The first consists of verses 21 and 22, where the Lord showed the disciples that He had to go to the cross and die
Since the Lord's rebuke followed the preceding verses, the will of God means the cross, and the thought of man means the self
The Lord concludes in the third section: 'If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me'
We always want to do this and that for the Lord; we never pause to inquire what He desires us to do and how to do it
All who do not accept, or are not willing to accept, the killing of the cross cannot understand or receive God's will
The basic requirements for knowing the will of God are: presenting ourselves as a sacrifice, and denying our self
Even though this step is not as basic as the first two requirements, it is still very important in the matter of knowing God's will
2)Second Corinthians 11:3, 'I fear, lest by any means your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and purity that is toward Christ'
These verses mention first the matter of our heart going after the treasure; then the light and darkness involving the eye follow
If our heart is set on God, our vision is clear; if our heart is set on other matters, our eye is evil and fails to see God's will
We regret, however, that among God's children there are very few whose hearts are absolutely turned toward Him
The hearts of the majority are turned either to the left or to the right; they are never absolutely turned toward God in simplicity
The dealing with the heart, although not as basic as consecration and the denial of self, is, however, very fine and deep
Once we have obtained this feeling and are clear about God's mind, we will speak and act according to this feeling
We will not employ craftiness or guile, but merely conduct ourselves in a truthful manner according to the spirit
After having contacted God and obtained the feeling in our spirit, we still need our mind to interpret and apprehend His will practically
If our mind has not been trained in spiritual things, we have no access to this realm and no way to understand God's will
It is regrettable that with many brothers and sisters there is a serious lack of training of the mind in the spiritual realm
Some brothers, when predicting the fluctuations in the stock market and calculating profits and loss, have very clever minds
They cannot have a normal heart, spirit, or mind; neither can they touch the feeling of the Holy Spirit or be led by Him
We generally have a common problem which causes us to be unable either to understand the feeling or to understand it accurately
Often our fear is not that we may be wrong and sin against God, but that the outcome may not be to our advantage
Although we may be wrong in a certain affair, yet our being and our spirit are still right, and God is still pleased with us
Another way of knowing God's will is to study the Bible, because God has revealed Himself and His will through His Word
We also need to study the minor principles in the Bible, such as those concerning clothing, eating, spending money, etc
We should pay attention to messages given in meetings, read spiritual books, and take heed to the various kinds of fellowship and sharings
Since their origins are found in the Bible and are very applicable and practical in revealing God's will, they should be heeded
We will not be merely following the regulations of letters, but in the light of life walking according to the spirit
When God leads and guides us according to His will, He usually arranges the appropriate environments for this purpose
He caused the sons of Laban to utter words against Jacob, which resulted in Laban changing his countenance toward him
The practical environment includes the people about us and the existence of situations with their manifold variations
A Christian seeking to know God's will should not only study his feeling within, and the Bible without, but also the environment about him
Beginning with obeying the teaching of the anointing, the spiritual experience of a Christian gradually progresses to a higher ground
Since God's will is lofty and eternal, man must come out of his own little circle and get into the larger circle of God
The experience of the stage of the cross is different in many respects from the previous spiritual experiences
A person who is saved in a very thorough way begins immediately to clear the past and deals with sin, the world, and the conscience
Even in the deeper lessons, such as obeying the teaching of the anointing and understanding the will of God, he has already made headway
At this time we will be led by the Lord to see how the cross can solve all these difficulties pertaining to our being
The problem of a leper is really not in his outward filthiness and ugliness, but in the poison of the disease within
The way of cleansing related to the leper, as recorded in Leviticus, is also the way of our being cleansed and dealt with before God
The priest shall go forth out of the camp' to examine the leper, because the leper could not enter into the camp, but must remain outside
The filthiness of the leper is a sin before God; therefore, it requires the cleansing of the sprinkling of the blood
The blood, shed by His death, and His everlasting life are brought unto us and become effective in us through His resurrection
From this time forth, he must cleanse away all his filthiness, dealing with both his inward and outward difficulties
It follows then that the leper has to 'shave off all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean'
Some boast of their ancestry, some of their education, some of their virtues, some of their zeal in their love for the Lord
What we will discuss in the third stage are the experiences of 'shaving of the hair,' that is, dealing with the problems of our own self
We will divide these dealings into the following items: dealing with the flesh, dealing with self, and dealing with the natural constitution
After we have dealt with sin, the world, and the conscience, it seems that all the outward filthiness has been dealt with
When the Israelites passed through Jordan, the wandering in the wilderness came to an end; they entered into the realm of new life
3)Galatians 5:24, 'They that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts thereof'
4)Romans 8:13, 'If ye live after the flesh, ye must die; but if by the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live'
Galatians 5:19-21 lists the manifestations of the flesh, such as fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, etc
Immediately after man was created, his body was in subjection to the soul, which, in turn, was in subjection to the spirit
Cain sinned and fell in that he was rejected by God because he served God according to his own delight and opinion
Usually when we mention the flesh, we think that the flesh is corrupt and wicked, just as mentioned in Galatians 5:19-21
Paul in Philippians 3:3-6 indicated that there were some who worshipped God in the flesh and boasted in their flesh
The flesh there undoubtedly refers to flesh in its good aspect, for by it man worships God and through it man boasts
Because although we are the people who fell deeply, we still have some good element which was originally created by God
After all, man or the flesh in its good aspect is weak and powerless, desiring to do good or serve God, but not being able to do either
The declaration that the holy anointing oil must not be poured upon man's flesh means that God cannot mingle or unite with the flesh
The Amalekites as the descendants of Esau typify the fallen natural part within us, that is the old man in the flesh belonging to Adam
Esau and Jacob were twins, but their descendants, the Amalekites and the Israelites, were mutual enemies; they could not stand together
Our fleshly old man is very close to our spiritual new man; the two are also mutual enemies and cannot stand together
When Saul became the king of Israel, God commanded him to smite Amalek, destroy all they had, and spare them not
In the book of Esther, Mordecai chose to die rather than to bow down to Haman, an Agagite, the descendant of Agar, the Amalekite
In the Old Testament God did one specific thing to express His attitude toward the flesh-He established circumcision
If man belongs to the flesh, minds the flesh, and lives by the flesh, whatever he does, either good or bad, cannot please God
Galatians 5:24, 'They that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof'
Just as Christ cannot be experienced without the Holy Spirit, so also the old man cannot be experienced without the flesh
The flesh is the living out and the expression of the old man; that is, the flesh is our experience of the old man
Our very being has fallen into the flesh and is bound and controlled by the flesh; hence, our whole being has become flesh
Being dead with Christ is merely a fact which Christ has accomplished for us before God; to us it is still objective
A very major and basic work of the Holy Spirit dwelling in us is to work into us the fact that Christ has crucified the flesh on the cross
In other words, the work of the Holy Spirit is to have the cross on Calvary wrought into us to become the cross within us
Romans 6 and 8 show clearly both the death that Christ accomplished and the death being executed by the Holy Spirit
After Romans 6 tells us that we have been crucified with Christ, Romans 8:13 says, 'By the Spirit ye put to death the deeds of the body'
When a man is willing to deal with his flesh, he always begins with the first step, that is, desiring a sinless life
When a man is being drawn by the Lord to pursue on, he automatically sees the filthiness and abominable traits of the corrupted flesh
It seems that the more he deals, the stronger the power of sin, so that he usually experiences complete failure
To deal only with the sins and not with the flesh is to neglect the cause and to deal with the consequence the result of which is vain labor
Romans 6 tells us that being baptized in Christ, we no longer should live in sins, nor should we present our members as instruments to sin
Chapter 7 follows by telling us that this person who deals with sin discovers that sin and the flesh are inseparable
If we do not deal with our very being, the problem of the flesh cannot be solved, and we cannot live a holy, sinless life
Christ has accomplished the objective fact for us, but we must be responsible for the subjective experience through the Holy Spirit
Whoever merely believes the fact that we have died with Christ on the cross does not have the real experience of dealing with the flesh
We must let the Holy Spirit execute this within us, so that it will become our practical, subjective experience
Galatians 5:24, 'They that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof'
The reasons are, first, that the crucifying of the flesh mentioned here is an act of our own initiative, not what Christ has done for us
We have said that the old man refers to the objective aspect, while the flesh always refers to our subjective experience
Even though they were saved and belonged to Christ, yet they lived by the flesh and did not crucify the flesh by the Holy Spirit
The Apostle told the Galatians that according to the normal way, all that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh
Since God has already crucified your old man with Christ, you also should have crucified the flesh by the Holy Spirit
Nor does the Bible say that Christ has already crucified our flesh, for this is our responsibility through the Holy Spirit
If we do not put the flesh to death by the Holy Spirit, then to this very day we are still living by the flesh
When God commanded Saul to kill the Amalekites, God Himself would not do the killing; Saul was the one to go to execute the Amalekites
On one hand God Himself does not deal with our flesh; we ourselves must be responsible to deal with the flesh and put it to death
Our dealing with the flesh is not at all like the religion of the Gentiles, which uses human effort to bring the flesh under subjection
To put the cross upon the 'I,' upon the 'old man,' was the objective fact accomplished by the Lord Jesus at Golgotha
The application of dealing with the flesh is a matter which is completely in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Whenever we are not in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, we immediately lose the reality of dealing with the flesh
Romans 6 speaks of the fact that the old man is crucified in Christ, while Romans 8 speaks of dealing with the flesh in the Holy Spirit
One of the elements of this life, the death of the cross, or the element of death, will then be applied to us in a practical way
The more the Holy Spirit moves in us, the more the element of the Lord's death will accomplish a killing work in us
It is not until our experience gradually grows deeper that this death will be executed generally upon all our actions
Later, we allow the Holy Spirit to purify all our actions, whether good or bad, by executing the death of the cross in us
Consequently, all that we are in the natural constitution, the old creation, the self, will be solved by the cross
Take for example the matter of visiting the saints, offering a gift, and other such things which we think are good and spiritual
Praise the Lord, in the past years we have served the Lord with many co-workers, yet among us there has been no quarrel or division
The deeper reason is that we all have to some extent learned the lesson of dealing with the flesh by the cross
The cross within us kills all the strife and jealousy of the flesh, to the end that we cannot quarrel or be divisive
If we apply dealing with the flesh to all our actions, we will eventually walk after the law of the Spirit of life
Not only will we not sin or err according to the flesh, but we will not even touch spiritual things or serve God in the flesh
The first point in dealing with the flesh is that we must know what the flesh is and sense the flesh within us
If we wish to have a real experience in dealing with the flesh, we need to have a clear knowledge and sense of the flesh
The meaning of the flesh has three aspects, namely: the corrupted flesh, the whole fallen man, and the aspect of man's good
As we go on with the Lord, we need to have a deeper knowledge and dealing concerning the other two aspects of the flesh
The third point in dealing with the flesh is that we must know the relationship and difference between the flesh and the old man
Dealing with the flesh is entirely a matter of experience- that of dealing with the old man in a practical way
After we realize these four basic points in dealing with the flesh, we will have the experience of dealing with the flesh
The procedure of our experience in dealing with the flesh begins with a deeper longing and seeking for spiritual things
The thing which hinders us most from a deeper mingling with the Lord and hinders the Lord from living more deeply in us is our flesh
Not to mention the evil aspect of our flesh, even what we ordinarily consider as good is also full of the element of man and the self
At this time we will have a little subjective experience in the matter of dealing with the flesh through the death of the cross
At this time, not only will we live by the Spirit, but also walk by the Spirit; then we will no longer be fleshly, but spiritual
The process of dealing with the flesh which we have mentioned cannot be thoroughly experienced in a short period of time
It is not until our spiritual experience grows deeper that we gradually recognize our flesh and have further dealings
In our dealing with the flesh, we deal firstly with the corrupted aspect, and then with the good aspect of the flesh
The important thing is this: when you deliver a message, are you the one speaking, or is the Holy Spirit speaking through you?
If this inactivity is not derived from fellowship with the Holy Spirit, but rather from their own decision, it is a worse kind of flesh
Some brothers and sisters have been enlightened to see that their former prayers were of the flesh; therefore, they do not pray any more
All those who live in the Holy Spirit can never stop working, for the Holy Spirit is their motivating power, causing them to work even more
The flesh is nothing more than making your own decision and having your own opinion; it is simply being what you are and doing what you want
When we have really dealt with the flesh, we will not decide anything according to ourselves, either to do or not to do
Although he also prepares himself to deliver the message, he has learned the lesson of rejecting the flesh and depending upon the Spirit
It may be that after the singing and the prayer, he still does not know what to say; yet at this point he still does not decide by himself
We must abide in the Lord and act as the Lord works within us; we must also speak as the Lord speaks within us
Whenever we do not walk according to the Spirit and mind the Spirit nor live in the Spirit, we are in the flesh
It is only by walking after the Spirit, minding the Spirit, and living in the Spirit, that we are released from the flesh
There are many spiritual terms which we use quite often, but when we press for the real meaning, it is difficult to explain them
All that the Lord said here is the will of God, because the cross of the Lord is the will of God ordained in eternity
When we compare this word with the preceding verse, we comprehend that this self which the Lord asked us to deny is the human thought
When the Lord asked the disciples to receive the cross, this meant that they should receive the mind of God or the will of God
The Lord was asking the disciples here to put aside their own thought and receive the cross, which is the will of God
If the soul life is being put to death, which means that self is being denied, there will be no more human opinion
We can find here a definition for self: self in essence is the soul life, while the expression of self is opinion
Just as when we touch the Holy Spirit, we touch Christ; so when we touch human opinion and viewpoint, we touch self as well as the soul life
In these thirtyfive long chapters Job and his three friends and later Elihu were talking arguing and expressing their opinions continually
At first Job spoke words without knowledge and expressed his own opinion, but at the end he abhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes
He felt that he had done no wrong and that there was no need for him to deal with sin, the world, or the conscience
A sinning one, or one who loves the world, does not speak much, because he is aware of his mistakes and shortcomings
The reason for so many divisions in Christianity today is not only the sinfulness and worldliness of man, but more so the self of man
What she answered was not what the Lord had asked; her comprehension of what the Lord had said was really remote
From these narratives relating to the people mentioned, we can clearly see that the expression of self is in the human thoughts and opinions
If we join these seven items together, we may state the following: There is a created, fallen man whose name is the old man
When we see this fact and acknowledge that the Lord has done away with the old man on the cross then we can say I am crucified with Christ
The old man has a soul life, which when being lived out is expressed in the flesh, temper, self, and the natural constitution
As we apply in our experience the crucifixion with Christ through the Holy Spirit to our soul life, that is dealing with the soul life
When we apply the death of the cross to whatever is lived out from our soul life, whether it be good or bad, that is dealing with the flesh
When we apply the death of the cross to our opinions and ideas, that is dealing with self, or bearing the cross
In spite of this, the way to deal with self is still the cross, just as the way to deal with the flesh is the cross
The objective fact in dealing with self just as in dealing with the flesh rests in Christ that is our old man has been crucified with Him
With God, the problem of the old man has already been solved; thus self, which is of the old man, has also been solved
On the objective side, the only fact is that our old man has been crucified; but on the subjective side, there is more to it
The subjective experience in dealing with the self, just as in dealing with the flesh, is through the Holy Spirit
The first step in our dealing with self subjectively is to see that our opinions are one of the expressions of the old man
To bear the cross is not to bear suffering but to bear death, not to put ourselves under suffering but to put ourselves under death
The bearing of the cross is nothing else but a declaration that in this universe the death of the cross is accomplished by Christ
The crucifixion is accomplished by the Lord, and the bearing of the cross is our responsibility in experiencing it
Once we receive this fact, the Holy Spirit will further reveal to us that our opinions and ideas are the expression of the old man
Whenever we discover that we are about to voice our opinion and idea, we will immediately deny it and put it under the death of the cross
The Lord's children today, provided they have a seeking heart, will find it much easier to know and experience all these lessons
In the experience of our dealing with self we must pay attention to a further matter- the relationship between self and Satan
Not only do they feel that their opinion is better than that of others, but they even feel that opinions themselves are essentially good
In spite of this, the Bible reveals that not only is sin of Satan, but even the opinions which man deems to be good are also of Satan
We may say that Satans incarnation in us causes him on one hand to become the sin in our body and on the other hand the opinion in our soul
On one hand he stirs up the lust of the members of the body, and on the other hand he arouses the opinions in the mind
Whenever Satan comes to tempt man, he first causes man to have an opinion in his soul; then he causes the body to sin
In other words, by his crafty questions he caused the mind of Eve to entertain doubt, which in turn caused her to formulate opinions
When man was first created, before he was seduced by Satan, he lived in a very simple way before God, without doubt or opinion
The Lord here directly rebuked Peter as Satan, because the Lord knew that Satan was hiding behind this opinion of Peter
On the one hand they fulfill the desires of the lusts of the flesh, and on the other hand they fulfill the desires of their mind
When Satan works in our flesh, it results in the lust of our flesh, which is sin; when he works in our mind, the result is opinion, or self
Whenever an opium-addict is confronted with opium, he feels itchy; whenever a gambler sees the gambling devices, he feels itchy
In the same manner, when Satan works in man's mind and gives man an opinion, man becomes itchy within and cannot help but express it
Just as sin is the result of the desires of man's flesh, so also is our opinion the result of the desires of man's mind
Everybody esteems his own opinions highly, treasures his own opinions, and feels very sweet when meditating upon them
We deny ourselves in a practical way, we deny thoroughly the place of Satan in us, and we overthrow Satan's stronghold in us
The dealing with self which we are speaking of is entirely different from the magnanimity commonly spoken of among worldly people
Our dealing with self is based upon our realization that opinion is not only an expression of the old man but also the embodiment of Satan
They endeavor to maintain peace with others; thus, in everything they seem to be very courteous and never quarrelsome
If others do not accept their opinion, they can restrain themselves from expressing it; they would never force others to accept it
They would even go to the extent, outwardly, of going along with the opinion of others and following others' way of doing things
Outwardly they do not insist on anything, yet inwardly they never lay aside their own opinion; rather they would keep it forever
Being magnanimous in such a way is absolutely not dealing with opinion nor dealing with self; on the contrary it nurtures opinions
The only reason he does not insist on his own opinion is that he is able to make allowances for others and bear with others
These persons are seemingly meek, but actually are always self-righteous; seemingly humble, but in fact most arrogant
They resemble the Pharisees, self-righteous and self-right, whom the Lord rebuked as in darkness and blindness
He feels that he is the father of the orphans, the eyes of the blind, the feet of the lame, always helping others and bearing with others
Because the self has already been broken by the cross, he cannot lose his temper nor can he be magnanimous, even if he wants to
We should never have the concept that to deal with self means to be magnanimous and thus become a magnanimous person
It is only when we repeatedly apply this death that our self gradually decreases and the life of Christ gradually grows within us
In regard to dealing with flesh and dealing with temper, all who have pursuit in spiritual things have had some experience
The biggest reason is that we think our opinions are good and lovable, not knowing that self is hidden within them
Only those who have been enlightened by the Lord know that man's opinion is the enemy of God's will as well as the opponent of the cross
When we are together with young brothers or sisters, we need to grasp this principle and not permit their opinion to have any place
Unfortunately most of us are not clear with regard to this aspect of the truth and we unconsciously fall into the error of being magnanimous
While we are with others we sometimes have our opinion yet for the sake of not striving with others we refrain from expressing our opinion
Quarrelling exposes the corruption of man; thus when man is enlightened by the Holy Spirit, he will fall before God
In dealing with self we must see that as long as we live and grow in ourselves, Christ will have no way to live or grow
All the objective facts in Christ are accomplished once for all, but all the subjective experiences in the Holy Spirit are continuous
The farmer weeds the field; today the weeds are removed, but tomorrow they will grow again, and he must remove them again
Today we are still in the old creation, and the old man cannot refrain from expressing himself in various aspects
When speaking of the subjective dealing, the Lord said that we need to bear the cross, meaning that we cannot depart from the cross
It is not that you bear the cross when you have an opinion during the meeting, and then after the meeting you throw off the cross
When the Lord touched upon the matter of dealing with self, He spoke about the bearing of the cross and not the crucifixion
Many think that once we accept the cross, our self is terminated and there is no further need to bear the cross
We need to bear the cross continually until we are raptured and transfigured, at which time we can be separated from the cross
When through the Holy Spirit we apply the cross so that we have the mark of the cross upon us continually, this is called bearing the cross
During our entire life, we should apply the death of the cross to our self and be one who denies self and bears the cross
It is an outstanding characteristic of the soulish man and a prominent expression of the living out of the old man
Some people are very talkative and always express their own opinion; that means that their self is very strong
When speaking of the natural constitution, Jacob, in the book of Genesis, is the best representative character
Actually, the most outstanding characteristic in the entire life of Jacob is his natural endeavoring and scheming
Soon after passing through the river to meet his brother Esau, he was still fulfilling his own scheming and plotting
Spiritually speaking, he was at this time completely delivered from being natural, and he entered into resurrection
When some people hear about dealing with the natural constitution, they think that God does not want our ability and capability
From the revelation of the Bible, we clearly see that the work of God on this earth requires man's cooperation
Just as wood and stone cannot cooperate with God, so also foolish and incapable persons cannot cooperate with God
Throughout the generations, all those who have been used of God have been the capable ones gained from this world
Though Peter and John were but fishers of Galilee, we can presume that they were among the best of the fishers and by no means ordinary men
It can never be that those who do not know how to do anything and are incapable and unwilling to do anything can be used by God
We often hear brothers and sisters say, 'I believe that God can do it,' yet they themselves make no effort to cooperate
Natural ability is similar to raw iron which, because it is too hard and brittle, is not suitable for use and is easily broken
On the other hand if Jacob merely depended upon his natural mind natural thought or capability he could not have uttered those words either
All natural ability is mingled with the elements of flesh and temper; therefore, when it is disapproved, it becomes provoked
All natural ability contains pride and makes oneself feel capable, thereby resulting in boasting and self-glorification
All ability which has been broken and resurrected is not for self, neither does it contain any element of self
Since we are clear now concerning the difference between natural and resurrected ability, we should examine ourselves in our experience
Dealing with the natural constitution is the same as dealing with the flesh and the self-it is based on objective fact
Since our old man has been crucified with Christ, our natural constitution also has been dealt with in the old man
The process of the experience of dealing with the natural constitution closely resembles that of dealing with self
We must see that our old man has been crucified with Christ; then we shall experience the dealing that follows
After we have seen the first two points, we will automatically receive the crucifixion of Christ upon our natural constitution
Once we receive and apply this, all our natural ability will be stamped with the mark of death and gradually become withered
In order to experience dealing with the natural constitution, we must first be in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
In other words, every time we discover our cleverness, wiles, and capability, we must immediately apply the death of the cross to them
In this way the stamp of the death of the cross is applied to all the practical expressions of the natural constitution
Dealing with self and dealing with the natural constitution are the deeper experiences in the stage of the cross
If we wish to have the kind of service according to God's heart desire, dealing with self and the natural constitution is a must
Strictly speaking, those who have never been dealt with in the self and in the natural constitution cannot serve God
One day, when he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren, he smote the Egyptian and hid him in the sand
When Moses wrote Psalm 90 he said, 'The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years'
When we study the life of Moses, we see that ever since he was called by God, he never again used his own power and ability to work for Him
Although he prayed to God, he was but seeking His counsel; he did not, except on one occasion, voice any of his opinions or ideas
Not only is this a great crisis in his spiritual life and service, but it is in itself a very serious matter in the eyes of God
God not only led the Old Testament saints in such a way, but also used many objects and situations in the Bible to typify this matter
The altar typifies the redemption of the cross, with the emphasis upon solving the problem of sin that we may experience salvation
The laver represents the cleansing of the Holy Spirit, with the emphasis upon washing away our earthly defilements that we may be renewed
These items approximate in typology the third stage of our spiritual life, a stage which involves deeper experiences
In the holy of holies there is only an ark, which contains the tables of the covenant, the golden pot of manna, and the budded rod of Aaron
The budded rod of Aaron typifies Christ as our acceptance before God, corresponding to the golden altar of incense in the holy place
These three items in the ark are the same in nature in typology as the three items in the holy place; however, the conditions are changed
How can we from the shallow experience of the outer court enter into the deep experience of the holy of holies?
We must start from the altar and go forward, until one day we experience the rending of the veil and enter into the holy of holies
Sinai and go forward until we reach Jordan, where our old creation is dealt with; then we can enter into the land of Canaan
The major work of God toward us through the Holy Spirit, aside from the Holy Spirit as the anointing, is in His outward discipline
The Bible says very little in a literal way about the discipline of the Holy Spirit; indeed, it contains no such phrase
Such a condition may be likened to the fact that most fathers prepare good things for their children, not whips and rods
In many families the father is forced to resort to rebuking and whipping because of the children's stubbornness and rebellion
Some brothers and sisters seem to glory in testifying of their experience while being disciplined by the Holy Spirit
We should be aware of our own obstinacy, stubbornness, lawlessness, and disobedience, which causes punishment from God our Father
All those who boast concerning the discipline of the Holy Spirit are those who do not know the nature of the discipline of the Holy Spirit
Judging from our condition, the discipline of the Holy Spirit is most needful, because we are by nature rebellious, lawless, and disobedient
The purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit toward us can be divided into three aspects: chastisement, education, and breaking
Hebrews 12:10 tells us that the Father of spirits chastens us 'for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holiness'
The chastisement mentioned here is the first intention or the first category of the discipline of the Holy Spirit
While he lies in the hospital, groaning in anguish, the Holy Spirit speaks to him again, reminding him of the former demand
We have often said that the purpose of the anointing of the Holy Spirit within us is to anoint God's element into us
We must sand off the original paint, so that the surface becomes rough and better able to absorb the new paint
If we are filled with the element of self, the Holy Spirit finds it difficult to anoint us through His moving and anointing within
At this time the word of the Holy Spirit as well as the anointing and moving of the Holy Spirit will be effective
A raw person not only is wild and hard, but also has a foul smell, like any uncooked fish or meat, regardless of how good the quality may be
If so, we must bow in worship to the Lord and say that this brother has really been educated by the discipline of the Holy Spirit
We have repeatedly said that the work of God in us is for the central purpose of mingling and building His element into us
Contrariwise we see some who the more they are disciplined by the Holy Spirit the tougher and more built up in their own beings they become
The end result of the discipline of the Holy Spirit is always that we may be torn down, broken, and reduced to nothing
The discipline of the Holy Spirit is given to break and smash the one who is whole and to mess up the one who is in such perfect shape
If a person is always gentle, the Holy Spirit will trouble him to such an extent that he can no longer be gentle
If there is one who never contends with others, the Holy Spirit will trouble him to an extent that he is forced to contend
The gentleness, obedience, and other good points of some people are of the natural constitution and are by virtue of birth
The Holy Spirit will raise up environments again and again to irritate such a person and cause him to lose his temper
He will be discouraged, feeling that having lost his temper so badly, he can no longer serve the Lord, and his future will be terminated
He does not know that while he is afraid of being terminated, the Holy Spirit fears lest he will not be terminated
There is neither chastisement nor education; all the discipline of the Holy Spirit is for the tearing down and breaking
Only when we define them can we categorize them into the three aspects of chastisement, education, and breaking
After all is said and done, the discipline of the Holy Spirit has only one purpose-to tear us down and break us
Of course, if we are disobedient, we will be dealt with; however, though we are obedient, we will still be dealt with
Although the discipline of the Holy Spirit deals with things within us, the discipline itself is in our outward environment
We have said that the positive work of God through the Holy Spirit is the inner anointing, guidance, enlightening, strengthening, etc
The Bible speaks much about these aspects, which are all glorious, sweet, and of chief importance in the eyes of God
Again, a thief who steals our clothing, or a fire which burns our house, is definitely not sent directly by God, but by Satan
All the people, things, and happenings involved in the discipline of the Holy Spirit are measured to us by God according to our need
The purpose of our experiencing the discipline of the Holy Spirit is that we may experience the anointing of the Holy Spirit
If there were only the discipline of the Holy Spirit, but not the anointing of the Holy Spirit, it would be meaningless
There are two characteristics of the discipline of the Holy Spirit: one is temporal, the other of long duration
Since as Christians they cannot be divorced the wife becomes the lifelong discipline to the husband and likewise the husband to the wife
The disciplines of long duration are mostly in an environment which we contact regularly, such as our family, job, church, or relatives
Some, like Paul, live continually with a thorn in the body-it may be weakness of the physical body or a certain disablement
Everything that comes to us, including people, things, and happenings, either great or small, is the discipline of the Holy Spirit
Whether you can have a virtuous and prudent wife or marry the husband of your desire depends on the discipline of the Holy Spirit
You do not care for many children, yet unfortunately your children are especially numerous; this is the discipline of the Holy Spirit
Even the loss of property, mismanagement of affairs, or failure in spiritual matters are the discipline of the Holy Spirit
In accepting the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we must first acknowledge that all we encounter is of the discipline of the Holy Spirit
And not one of them shall fall on the ground without your Father: but the very hairs of your head are all numbered'
Since we acknowledge that whatever comes to us is the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we must discover what the purpose of the discipline is
Once we discover the purpose of the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we should have a thorough confession regarding the point in view
After we see that the purpose of this discipline is to deal with a specific point, we must submit ourselves in that particular point
We place more emphasis upon the aspect of his entire life's experience, because it includes his life of sojourning
When Jacob worshipped God by leaning on the top of his staff, it means that he worshipped God according to his experience
If one has never had the experience of being dealt with by God, it is difficult for him to render worship before God
It seems that we have accepted the discipline, but we have not accepted it fully; therefore, that acceptance is not solid
If the nature of the discipline is of an extended and long duration, we need not only to accept it, but to know how to apply it
While the brother who was hit was on the hospital bed, he realized the cause of being disciplined and submitted
To apply the discipline means that we cooperate with the Holy Spirit and help Him to discipline and deal with ourselves
When little children take medicine, they sometimes need an adult to squeeze their nose and force the medicine down their throat
Before we were saved, and even before we were born, God has already prearranged our parents, husband or wife, children, church, or co-worker
In the whole universe, God has exercised His wisdom greatly to look for all these wonderful disciplinary measures in order to deal with us
No matter how many dealings he has passed through, he remains sealed and untouched, without any result from the discipline
We have simply submitted everything to fate and allowed the environment to pass meaninglessly by us as time goes on
The more we accept the discipline of the Holy Spirit, the greater will be the result and the richer the spiritual condition
Some people have been in painful trials, but after a certain period their sufferings have passed away and their life has become easy
Normally, the discipline of the Holy Spirit through trials by suffering is always more frequent than through tests of prosperity
Many times our spirit is not upright or correct because we have not received the discipline of the Holy Spirit
It is only when we have dealt adequately with our spirit that we can accept from deep within the dealing of the Holy Spirit
A right spirit is not what we originally have, but is usually the result of God's visiting and dealing with us
Even our spiritual activities, such as praying, fellowshipping, and preaching must all be done in our spirit to be genuine
When a man is not angry, he always follows a certain set of rules or etiquette outwardly, his real situation being hidden within
When he becomes extremely mad, to the point that he can neither bear nor hide his anger any more, he explodes regardless of everything
One who is refined in appearance and who seldom loses his temper is usually a false man, while one who often loses his temper is genuine
In conclusion, the deepest and most genuine part of man is the spirit, and the spirit is the genuineness of man
The purpose of the previous lessons on dealing with the flesh, the self, and the natural constitution is to let the spirit come forth
When their spirit comes forth, it bears with it some improper conditions, such as being rude, haughty, crooked, or unfair
As a result, his spirit as well as the Holy Spirit within his spirit are really released so that many people are touched
Without doubt his spirit is released at this time, but the condition of its being released is neither right nor pure
It is a problem whether or not our spirit is released, but even more a problem whether it is clean when it is released
They are able to differentiate between good and evil, and, through the fellowship part of their spirit, have the concept of worshipping God
The water itself is clean and odorless, but as it flows out, it passes through a sulphur deposit and brings with it the sulphuric element
Since there is the element of sulphur in the water, it becomes sulphur water, and when it flows out it carries with it the sulphuric odor
Surrounding the spirit are the soul and body both of which have been mixed with the wicked elements of Satan and are thus filthy and corrupt
When the spirit comes forth and passes through the soul and body, it becomes contaminated by this filthiness and corruption
When being manifested, the spirit bears certain filthiness, corruption, impurity, impropriety, and various other undesirable conditions
If our motive is not pure the spirit also is not pure when released if our intention is not clean the spirit coming forth is also not clean
We can see this more fully from the illustration we have used concerning preaching when it is used for showing off and for competition
When we contact others or help others in spiritual matters, we should touch their spirit and know their intention and motive, etc
The purpose of the heart and the motive in man's spirit are just like a person's accent-they are very difficult to disguise
Another may say that he would be happy to help if there were only an opportunity; yet you touch in him an unwilling spirit
If we learn to touch his spirit, the purpose of his heart, his motive, his aim, and his intention cannot escape our observation
At this time, from your deepest being, you deal thoroughly with your unforgiving purpose of heart and intention
Later when you mention this brother to others although you touch the controversial matter of the past your spirit is undisturbed and upright
If our spirit has never been dealt with, then even while praising others we cause an uncomfortable feeling in others
It may be that in our praising there is the purpose of flattering or the intention of gaining rewards from others
Since the passage of the spirit includes every part of our being, we need to deal with every part of our being when dealing with the spirit
When all the elements of our old creation have been completely dealt with, then the Holy Spirit can possess and fill our whole being
Dealing with the conscience and dealing with the spirit are very delicate dealings within us and are seemingly difficult to distinguish
At this point, she has dealt with the matter of speaking thus to others with a bad motive, and she has peace in her conscience
As soon as she mentions the same subject her spirit being released that particular motive that mixture will automatically be brought forth
At this time, she has not only dealt with her improper, outward behavior, but also with the mixture itself within her
Although the condemning and the removal are through the power of the Holy Spirit, yet they are of our own initiative
The Holy Spirit requires the cooperation of our will; when He has this, He will supply us with the power for dealing
The Holy Spirit supplies the strength, but we must take the initiative to put to death the deeds of the body through the Holy Spirit
We have spoken before of Galatians 5:24, which says that we that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts
Human cultivation is purely the work of man, whereas the dealing which we initiate is based upon the fact of the cross
All these dealings are in the accomplished fact of Christ on the cross and are now being experienced by us in the Holy Spirit
If we cooperate in this manner, this feeling of life becomes a killing power, enabling us to have the experience of the killing of the cross
Concerning the degree of dealing whereby we can obtain peace, the Holy Spirit will be responsible to speak to us and give us a clear feeling
If, however, there is some problem deep within which gives us no peace, we should not listen to outward reasonings
We must take heed to the inner demand of the Holy Spirit and thereby attain the standard required by the Holy Spirit deep within
If we accept the word of the Lord with a pure heart and compare our experience with it, we will feel that it is rather simple
In the Old Testament the Spirit of God came upon man outwardly, whereas in the New Testament the Holy Spirit dwells in man inwardly
Since the Spirit of God merely came upon man, He may 'not strive with man for ever' , and sometimes He may be taken away
In the Old Testament the Spirit of God was mainly for empowering whereas in the New Testament the Holy Spirit has come mainly to be the life
He had the supernatural power of God upon him, but at the same time he did not have the nature of God in him at all
With respect to power, Samson was full of the Spirit of God, but with respect to life, he did not have the Holy Spirit
In the Old Testament the Spirit of God was employed by man, whereas in the New Testament the Holy Spirit is the Lord in man
We know that the Holy Spirit is a Person, but in Old Testament times the Spirit of God did not descend upon man in His Person
In Old Testament times He descended as a power without His Person; therefore, it seemed instead that He obeyed man and was employed by man
Take for example the gasoline in a car: it is without a person; it is not the master of the car for the car to obey
God desired that Moses deliver the Israelites out of Egypt and lead them into Canaan, but Moses found himself lacking in power
Neither did he have the power to rule the house of Israel, nor the power to build a tabernacle for God according to the heavenly pattern
The Spirit of God came not to be his master for him to obey, but to supplement his lack of power and be under his command
Since He comes in His Person to dwell in man, He comes to be the Lord of man, requiring man's obedience to Him
It is interesting that there is not a single sentence in the entire Old Testament which says that man ought to obey the Spirit of God
In the New Testament we are told that the Holy Spirit takes the control over us and that we ought to walk by the Spirit
He dwells within us to be our Lord; therefore we must commit ourselves to Him and submit ourselves to His rule
In the Old Testament the Spirit of God is of a single aspect, whereas in the New Testament the Holy Spirit is of a double aspect
We have seen the characteristics of the working of the Holy Spirit in the two great periods, the Old Testament and New Testament
People in Old Testament times did not experience the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, but only the outward descending of the Spirit of God
In New Testament times the indwelling of the Holy Spirit becomes the basis for His outward descending upon man
It was the Holy Spirit that entered into Mary, one of the old creation, and out from her was born Jesus the Nazarene
We see that this condition of His was exactly the same as that of the Old Testament people experiencing the Holy Spirit
When Ezekiel was by the river of Chebar, the Spirit of Jehovah descended upon him, and he opened his mouth and spoke for God
Concerning John the Baptist, Luke 1:15 says, 'He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb'
Although John was the greatest among the prophets, the Lord said that the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he
They also experienced first the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and then the outward descending of the Holy Spirit
The Lord fulfilled His earlier promise by causing them to have the Holy Spirit enter into them and become their life
The day God created Adam out of the dust, He breathed into him that he might have life and become a living man with a spirit
Now, in the same manner, the Lord breathed into the disciples that they might have life and become regenerated men
At Pentecost, the Apostles experienced the other aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit, namely, the Holy Spirit as power
Suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting
They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance'
From this time forth, the Apostles preached the gospel with great power, bringing thousands and tens of thousands to salvation
If we compare both instances of the experiences of the Apostles in receiving the Holy Spirit, we can see the difference
After Pentecost, the experience of the Holy Spirit inwardly as well as outwardly was fully accomplished in the Head as well as in the Body
The Holy Spirit within is the basis for the Holy Spirit without, while the Holy Spirit without is the proof of the Holy Spirit within
In order to receive the regeneration of the Holy Spirit, we must first confess, repent, and accept the fact that Christ has died for us
In order to receive the infilling of the Holy Spirit, we must first accept the fact that we have died with Christ
For this reason we have placed this lesson of being filled with the Holy Spirit after all the experiences of the dealings
After we have dealt with everything and emptied ourselves, we must believe that the Holy Spirit is filling us from within
We only need to believe in the filling of the Holy Spirit, without trying to feel whether or not we have been filled
If we will only believe in this manner, the Lord will cause the filling of the Holy Spirit to become our practical experience
Beginning in the Old Testament, whoever was really willing to be used by God obtained the descending of the Spirit of God upon him as power
Originally they were fishermen, but they gave up both the fish and the boat, and with their whole heart were willing to be used by God
Before that, they also were prepared to be used by God; therefore, at a meeting of the Lord's Table, the Holy Spirit greatly filled them
They completely disregard God's work and God's plan; neither do they desire to have power to work for God and fulfill His plan
Even though the Holy Spirit within repeatedly moves them and puts demands upon them, yet they persist in refusing
When Rebecca was engaged to Isaac, she made no delay, but leaving her father's house, she followed the old servant to give herself to Isaac
As to the manner of the manifestation of the outward filling, we need to allow the Holy Spirit to bear full responsibility
God now has gained absolute ground in us, and our whole being within and without is entirely filled with the Holy Spirit
Let us look at the type in the Old Testament as shown in the account of the Israelites' departure from Egypt and their entrance into Canaan
After baptism, it is not enough to deal with the flesh just once; we must be dealt with in the hand of God for months and years
Sometimes God leads us through the wilderness so that not only is our living difficult but even our spirits are dry depressed and miserable
When the Israelites fulfilled their days of wandering, God led them through the Jordan, and they were circumcised in Gilgal
Henceforth, we shall attain to the heavenly realm in a practical way, thereby inheriting all the fulness of Christ
It is at this very time that we contact the hosts of evil spirits in the heavenlies and begin the experience of spiritual warfare
During their entire journey, the Israelites passed through two bodies of water: the Red Sea, and the River Jordan
The Red Sea was for the burial of Pharaoh and his armies, whereas the Jordan was for the burial of the Israelites themselves
When they passed through the Jordan, they brought twelve stones over with them and set up another twelve stones in the river bed
We understand by all these types that the first three stages of our spiritual life have transpired before we pass through the Jordan
Only by passing through the various dealings and having our own problems solved, can we engage in spiritual warfare
Each member shares in common the same life together with all the other members, that is, the life of the entire body
It is at this time that we begin to know a little concerning the Body and become qualified to engage in spiritual warfare
God's plan from eternity is to get a group of people to share His life, bear His image, and be united with Him as one
The Bible reveals to us that God is in His Son: all that God is and all that God has, all the fullness of the Godhead, dwells in the Son
The usual concept of a son places the emphasis on the son being born of the father, and the son and the father existing as separate beings
In the Bible the emphasis in relation to the Son of God is that He is the expression of God and cannot be separated from God
In John 1:18 we read: 'No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him'
After Christ came to this earth and became flesh, He imparted His life into us that we may become sons of God and His brethren
In saying that we are Christ's brethren, the emphasis is that we and Christ together are God's sons and together are God's expression
For though we become brethren of Christ one by one, yet the Bible further states that we are the 'house of God'
Similarly, Christ did not have many segments removed , but only one segment was taken from Him, and that was for the saving of the Church
In 1 Corinthians 1227 we read Ye are the body of Christ and severally members thereof in 1 Corinthians 1017 We who are many are one body
These verses state that we are the Body of Christ, not that each one of us individually forms the Body of Christ
The point to be stressed in what we have said regarding ourselves as the Bride of Christ is that the Church came out from Christ
When we refer to ourselves as the Body of Christ, the point to be emphasized is that the Church and Christ are one
In summary we see five points in Gods plan a God desired to work Himself into man and unite Himself with man so that man would resemble Him
When this purpose has been accomplished, the Body of Christ will appear, the Bride will appear, and the brethren will appear
We have already said that God's heart desire is to get a group of people who will have His life and express Him
Why then did He not at the same time create thousands of men, instead of creating only Adam and letting thousands of men come out from him?
He created only one woman, which means that God desires only one corporate man, which is the Church, to become the Bride of Christ
Though these events have taken place at different times and in different places, from God's standpoint, He never saves individually
When the entire house of Israel came out from Egypt, the lamb was eaten and the blood applied at the same place and at the same time
Similarly, in our understanding, salvation takes place earlier or later, here or there; but with God a thousand years is as one day
He did not plan for His Son to have two bodies, but only one; nor did He create two persons for His Son, but only one
Whether in God's plan, in His creation, or in His redemption, the thought is one and one alone, and this oneness is the Body
Whenever we as Christians are not one, we are not in the Body, and we demonstrate that we have not seen what the Body is
If we live in the Holy Spirit, we have this fellowship, and we have this oneness, which is the reality of the Body
If in our experience we are one, we are conscious of the oneness, and we touch the oneness; then we know the Body and live in the Body
In God's plan, in God's creation, in God's redemption, in Christ, in the Holy Spirit, in life, and in fellowship, all is one
Of all, we must know that our knowledge and experience of this oneness are definitely related to our spiritual age
When he learns some spiritual lessons, he feels that he is much superior to those brothers and sisters who have not learned
If we speak with regard to dealings, knowing the Body is also a kind of dealing, that is, a dealing with individualism
Only when the flesh, the self, and the natural constitution have been severely dealt with will individualism be removed
When we go to visit a place of fame, we travel a certain distance; at length we arrive at our destination and see the object of our journey
On one hand, the truth brings in the experience; and, on the other hand, because of the experience, we know the truth
If one does not have the experience of walking according to the Spirit, he does not know the teaching of the anointing
He may know a little regarding the doctrine of the Body, but he cannot touch either the actuality or the reality of the Body
One must pass through the putting to death of the flesh of Romans 8 before he can attain to the knowledge of the Body of Romans 12
From the beginning we must be very severe in dealing with ourselves especially in regard to our flesh our self and our natural constitution
Not until we have experienced the putting to death of the flesh in Romans 8 can we realize the Body in Romans 12
If in our experience we have not attained to this degree, we do not know it, and listening to much preaching on the subject avails nothing
Since knowing the Body is such a practical thing, how may we ascertain whether or not one knows the Body as yet?
If we really know the Body and realize the oneness contained in these seven matters, there can be no individualism
He cannot work without the coordination of the brothers and sisters, and he cannot live without the support of the church
It is at this stage that he is being knit together spontaneously with all the saints to become one Body, no more to be separated
Should this fellowship go beyond the limit, it will become rather incongruous and incomprehensible to the latter
Since their fellowship with the Lord has not reached this stage, they will have no idea what we are saying nor will they be able to respond
If one member is individualistic and isolated, he has no relationship with others as far as authority is concerned
The head is uppermost and is the authority of the whole body; from it, order is expressed throughout the whole body
All the members follow a definite order; therefore, any member, unless it is detached, falls into such an order
On one hand, it is under the authority of some of the members, and on the other hand, some other members are under its authority
We will know who is in front of us and who is behind us, who is in authority over us and over whom we are in authority
It is just like a family, where brothers and sisters know their own order-who should submit to whom and who is the authority of whom
If we do not know our order in the Body, we demonstrate that in our experience of life we have not reached the fourth stage
If one has a real knowing of the Body, sooner or later he will demonstrate the three proofs which we have mentioned
In order to know ascension, we need firstly to know the redemption of Christ, because ascension is included in it
If we read the Scriptures again carefully and examine our experiences, we will discover that His redemption includes ascension also
In these three main parts of Christ's redemption, Christ's death emphasizes deliverance from the negative aspects
That is, it saves us from sins, the world, the flesh, that which is natural, and all those things which are incompatible with God
Since the Lord's ascension is the conclusion of His death and resurrection, all three steps are closely connected
In Christ's ascension, He brought all that He had accomplished through His death and resurrection to the heavens
All that Christ has accomplished through His death and resurrection is brought into the ascension for application
Although this life has passed through death and resurrection, yet it is in the position of ascension that Christ gives this life to us
Although according to outward conditions we still live on earth, yet according to the inner life we are already in heaven
We as saved ones can be manifested in this age as shining light because of the ascended life which saves us and is now within us
All the spiritual gifts of Christians are given by the Lord in ascension and are for us to apply in the position of ascension
If we do not know the ground of ascension nor stand fast upon it, we will be unable to apply the spiritual gifts
If we want to visit people with much effectiveness, it is not necessary for us to speak much or preach many truths
Only this kind of prayer can touch the throne in the heavens and shake the gates of hell, thereby producing much spiritual consequence
Regardless of what our spiritual functions are, we must apply them in the heavenly position and manifest them in the heavenly realm
We must first be men of ascension with the position of ascension before we can attack the enemy in the air from above
If we are men of earth and lose the position of ascension, we will fall into the hand of the enemy and cannot fight against him
We not only cannot fight against Satan, but we also fall into the sphere of his activity and become the object of his devouring
If we live in the earthly life, using natural methods and means, we will never be able to solve these problems
If we pass through death and resurrection to reach the heavenly realm, we will surely obtain heavenly authority
When they see brothers or sisters loving the Lord, seeking Him, and living in the spirit, they admire them very much and are moved
With such brothers or sisters there is the heavenly reality; therefore, they are also full of heavenly authority
While they are walking among men, they bring with them a certain fearsomeness, which causes others to be reverent
Song of Songs 610 says Who is she that looketh forth as the morning fair as the moon clear as the sun terrible as an army with banners
The 'serpents' mentioned by the Lord refer to Satan, and the 'scorpions' are the evil spirits, the messengers of Satan
In order to engage in spiritual warfare, we must first know the position of ascension, and secondly, keep the position of ascension
In Paul's second journey, when he was preaching in Philippi, a certain maid with a spirit of divination followed, crying out after him
Paul, being greatly troubled, turned and said to the spirit, 'I charge thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her'
Paul here was standing in the position of ascension and exercising heavenly authority to halt the enemy's disturbing power
Only this kind of man can stand in the heavenly position, exercise heavenly authority, and engage in spiritual warfare
When they crossed the Jordan, they buried twelve stones at the bottom of the river, signifying their death and burial
Their entering Canaan after crossing Jordan typifies our experiencing the ascension through death and resurrection
In Song of Songs 1:9, the Lord praises her for the first time, saying that she is like 'a steed in Pharaoh's chariots
Though as a lily she lived a clean life and a life which received God's tender care, yet she still grew on earth
In the previous chapter we have seen the matter of knowing the ascension; now we will go on immediately to see the experience of reigning
Simply speaking, to reign is to exercise authority for God-to rule all things and in particular to deal with His enemy
He commanded illness to recede , cast out unclean spirits , and rebuked and calmed the storm and the raging sea
Later when the Apostles continued the Lords works they also had many experiences of reigning for God by healing and casting out evil spirits
We have mentioned in the previous chapter, Knowing the Ascension, that the basis of spiritual authority is the position of ascension
A traffic policeman standing at his assigned post has authority to direct the cars, that they may proceed in order
Not till after His resurrection and ascension did He obtain all authority in heaven and on earth and have dominion over all things
Our reigning is based not only on the position of ascension, but also on the position of order arranged by God
The position of his duty is equivalent to our position of ascension, and the position of his rank is equivalent to our position of order
He believed that the Lord needed only to exercise His authority and give a word of command, and the matter would be done
When God created man in the beginning, God gave man authority to have dominion over all the creatures in the sea, in the air, and upon earth
At that time, man was submitting to God's authority; hence, God's authority was with him, and all creatures were made to submit to man
Once man fell and rebelled against God, unwilling as he was to submit to God's authority, he then lost the authority of God
Not only can the poisonous snakes and wild beasts harm us today; even the tiny mosquitoes and fleas can bite us
Nearly every time he was confronted with the rebellion and quarreling of the Israelites, he submitted himself to God's authority
The result of his behaving each time in this way manifested even more clearly that God's authority was upon him
In his entire life, David submitted not only to God's authority, but also, in an absolute way, to the authority of order
He recognized that Saul was God's anointed one, that Saul was in the position of king, and that Saul was arranged by God to be his authority
Consequently, the day came when God also anointed him king, that he might reign for God in the nation of Israel
Each one of us must submit to the order of authority established by God, that is, to the representative authority of God
When we stand in our respective position of order Gods authority will be made manifest in our midst thus we will be able to reign for God
By their submission to God's authority, God's authority will be with them, and they will be able to reign and rule for God over all things
Knowing the position of ascension is the experience of knowing the ascension, which has previously been mentioned
They neither care for the difficulties arising in the church, nor inquire about the problems springing up in the Lord's work
God's authority will immediately be manifested in the church, and many rebellious and unlawful matters in the church will be subdued
Some of the brothers and sisters should have prayed, but they didn't; some should have spoken, but they withheld from speaking
If we live in the realm of ascension, we can tell which poverty and sickness is permitted by God and which is inflicted by Satan
Once we have discerned the matter, we must learn to reign by denying and opposing the poverty and sickness inflicted by Satan
Anything in this world, except that which is moved by the Holy Spirit, can be said to come from evil spirits, that is, from demons
A reigning spirit must be strong and living, active and not passive, positive and not negative, diligent and not loose
Concerning the fourth stage of spiritual life we have seen the first three experiences knowing the Body knowing the ascension and reigning
Let us first read Matthew 12:26, 28-29: 'If Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
Or how can one enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man?
We see that to cast out demons by the Spirit of God is to bring in the kingdom of God, which is to engage in spiritual warfare
Since to cast out demons is to bring in the kingdom of God, then before the demons are cast out, it is the kingdom of Satan that reigns
The people in the world are on one hand the subjects in the kingdom of Satan, and on the other hand the possessions in the house of Satan
It says here also that in order for one to spoil the goods of the strong man, he must first bind the strong man
The three 'lets' at the beginning and the three factors at the conclusion show us the goal of spiritual warfare
When men built the tower of Babel, rebelling together against God, they put the name of God aside and propagated their own name
The name of God is not being sanctified nor hallowed by men on earth today-an evil consequence of Satan's reigning
Generally speaking, the name appearing on a certain object identifies the object as belonging to the person of that name
For this reason, when God works on this earth, He pays attention continually to the matter of His name being hallowed
Through them He intends to recover the earth to God's ownership, so that the name of God will again become the only name that is hallowed
In that day, men truly will praise God, saying, 'O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth'!
Satan became the prince of the power of the air , and through the messengers under his hand he rules in the air and over the earth
Because of this, God was very displeased; it was a setback for His kingdom on earth, and it gave Him no place to reign on earth
Later, when the Lord Jesus came forth to preach, His first statement was also 'Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand'
Finally, what the Lord desires His church to preach throughout the whole earth is still 'the gospel of the kingdom'
Finally, the Lord desires us to have the third 'let,' that is, 'Let thy will be done as in heaven so upon the earth'
God's will can only be accomplished in heaven, not on earth, because the kingdom of God is still not on earth for Him to reign
In teaching us to pray, the Lord's interest is that God's name, God's reign , and God's will might reach to the earth
In the prayer which the Lord taught us, the conclusion says, 'For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory'
In order to engage in spiritual warfare, we must first know the opposition between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan
In addition, there is still another great difference: God's kingdom is legal, whereas the kingdom of Satan is illegal
In Isaiah 14:12-15 and Ezekiel 28:11-17, through the king of Babylon and the king of Tyre , God relates the process of Satan's rebellion
Within his kingdom are his messengers of various ranks, all of which were angels who followed Satan in rebelling against God
Today these are the principalities, powers, rulers, dominions, and spiritual hosts of wickedness of the air, Satan being their head
These disembodied spirits who dwell in the waters of judgment are the demons, the evil spirits, mentioned in the Bible
In the air are Satan and his messengers, and on earth are his servants and subjects, the innumerable demons and the myriads of people
At the time when the Lord Jesus was preaching the gospel on earth, He met people everywhere who were possessed by the demons
Before that day arrives, the period in which we are living is the time for the people of God to fight for Him on earth
Again, Colossians 1:13 says, 'Who delivered us out of the power of darkness, and translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love'
Preaching the gospel is wholly a spiritual warfare to drive out the power of Satan in men and bring in the kingdom of God
Strictly speaking, preaching the gospel, bringing salvation to men, and leading them to the Lord, is a kind of spiritual warfare
If our eyes have been opened by the Lord, we will see that the nature of our work in serving the Lord is that of warfare
These fleshly weapons not only refer to the losing of temper, but include all human schemes and natural methods
Later we remember that there is another brother who is rather intimate with him; so we ask that brother to go and talk with him
Even this kind of maneuvering is a fleshly weapon; it will eventually prove futile in solving the spiritual problem
In society and the business world, many such schemes are employed, but on the spiritual battlefield we cannot use schemes
In his dealings with the churches and his contacts with the saints, he was perfectly straight-as straight as an arrow
For this reason he could be 'mighty before God to the casting down of strongholds,' and thereby gain the victory in the spiritual warfare
In the same manner, if we wish to win the victory in all our spiritual works and be effective, we must forsake all fleshly weapons
Only those who live in the realm of the heavens can deal with the power of darkness in the air and chase the devil out
The help, the deliverance, which we afford others is based solely on that part which is of the heavenly nature in us
When a man has utterly reached the heavenly realm, his whole being, living, works, and actions are spiritual warfare
He is able to chase out the power of darkness from every place to which he comes and from all the people whom he meets
We can say that the basic principle of employing the spiritual weapons is that all our activities must be of the spirit
Whatever kind of activity we are engaged in, every one must be of the spirit and every one must release the spirit
After the Apostle mentioned the various kinds of spiritual weapons in Ephesians 6, he straightway said, 'Praying at every time in spirit'
Sometimes when we just start to talk about overcoming the world he immediately accuses us within saying Are you not still loving the world
Loving and caring for ourselves will cause us to lose the position of warfare and be unable to fight the battle
We ought not to care for our gain or loss, but through the blood, in the position of ascension, declare the Lord's victory
Exercising the various spiritual weapons to deal with Satan, we can overthrow his power and bring in the kingdom of God
Only then will we feel strongly that our only problem is Satan, and that we are here as warriors to deal with this enemy of God
We know also that the reason for all the confusion, striving, indifference, and corruption in the church is naught else but Satan
Revelation 12 reveals that once the manchild, who typifies the overcomers, is caught up to heaven, warfare immediately takes place
The moment they are caught up into heaven, they enter into conflict with Satan and cast him down from the air to the earth
Later, the Lord Jesus brings them with Him in His descent to the earth and casts Satan, who is on the earth, into the bottomless pit
Finally, at the end of the millennial kingdom, the enemy will be released for a short time and rebel for the last time
Again he will be dealt with by the Lord and the overcomers and will be cast into the lake of fire burning with brimstone
We shall now study the nineteenth lesson concerning life, which is also the last experience of life-being full of the stature of Christ
When we speak about being full of the stature of Christ, we mean that our life in Christ has attained to the realm of full maturity
If we have really experienced all the lessons of life mentioned previously, then the life of Christ can be fully wrought into us
If anyone has not experienced this first step, he is not saved, neither can he speak of the experiences of life which follow
Concerning the second step-Christ living and growing within us-every seeking Christian is in the process of the experience
Concerning being full of the stature of Christ, we must first realize that none can attain to this stage individually
A Christian who has experienced the brokenness of the flesh and the natural constitution will automatically see the Body of Christ
In Ephesians 318 we read that to apprehend the breadth the length the depth and the height of Christ we need a togetherness with all saints
Concerning the content, being full of the stature of Christ means that we are full of the life and nature of Christ
When a person's experience of life reaches its climax, the life and nature of Christ have permeated all the various parts of his being
The different parts of his spirit as well as the mind, will, and emotion of his soul are filled with the life and nature of Christ
There are many among us who have believed in the Lord for years, but to this day there is but little of the element of Christ in them
With regard to their emotion, their mood, desire, and inclination may be blameless, but they are still not filled with the element of Christ
At a certain point, all the elements of our mind, emotion, and will are Christ; then the stature of Christ is fully grown in us
In other words, when we think, it is Christ that thinks; when we delight, it is He that delights; and when we intend, it is He that intends
One who is newly saved can be compared to a glass of water with a little grape juice added, the greater part being water
Before, he looked at things in a certain way with a certain concept; now it is different; there is the element of Christ added
With regard to Christ being formed in us, we may use as an illustration grape juice whose color is deep enough to be easily recognized
Before Christ is formed in us, we may be likened to grape juice that is very lightly colored, making it difficult to be identified
Proceeding a little further, the water in the glass will no longer be seen; it will be swallowed up and overshadowed by the grape juice
When a person arrives at the full stature of Christ he is in the same position as Christ not only in objective fact but also in experience
When man's life has attained maturity and is seated with Christ on the throne in the heavens, he does not rise and fall nor waver easily
As Christ Himself is unshakable in the heavens, so are those who are full of the stature of Christ and who share the same position as Christ
He changes not because of place or time; no matter what kind of environment he encounters, he remains seated in heaven, unchanged
If we desire to learn whether or not we are mature in life, we should ascertain whether or not we can reign in the spiritual life
In Numbers 17, in order to prove that Aaron was invested with His authority, God caused his rod to bud, blossom, and bear almonds
All that we are will be full of the stature of the fullness of Christ, and all that we do will be to reign with Christ
Another issue of one who is full of the stature of Christ is that of dealing, together with Christ, with the enemy
When we are really full of the stature of Christ and our life has attained unto full maturity, our spiritual warfare is over
He continues to deal with the enemy, until eventually he will be subdued beneath His feet and become His footstool
When we attain to the stage of dealing, together with Christ, with the enemy, it is proof that our life has attained to its highest peak
As long as there are one or more who have a deeper life, trouble can hardly arise in the church or in the work
Aside from the fact that the body has not yet been transfigured into the body of glory, all else has reached its highest or final point
