In this chapter we will see how the bride is prepared.<h2 class=head1>THE BRIDE IN GENESIS AND REVELATION</h2><p>The Bible is very consistent in how it begins and how it ends. It begins and ends with the tree of life (Gen. 2:9; Rev. 2:7; 22:2, 14, 19), and it begins and ends with a flowing river (Gen. 2:10; Rev. 22:1). It begins with three kinds of precious materials-gold, bdellium, precious stones-and it ends with gold, pearl, and precious stones (Gen. 2:11-12; Rev. 21:18-21). It begins with a garden (Gen. 2:8), and it ends with a city (Rev. 21:2). In this way, the two ends of the Bible mirror one another.<p>At the beginning and end of the Bible there is also a bride. The difference between the two is that the bride in the beginning is only a type, a prefigure, a foreshadowing, of the coming bride. This may be compared to a person who sends her photograph before she comes to visit you. Her picture gives you a general idea of who she is, but when the person herself comes, you know her more definitely. In the beginning of the Bible there is a picture of the bride. At the end of the Bible comes the bride herself, who is now ready.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE BRIDE OF CHRIST</h2><p>In the New Testament the bride is the church, the counterpart of Christ who is the Man in the universe (Eph. 5:25-32). In Genesis 2:18 God said, &#8220;It is not good for the man to be alone.&#8221; This refers to Christ (Rom. 5:14). It is not good for Christ to be alone without the church. Christ needs the church. As a young Christian I was told that there are many mansions in the heavens, waiting to be filled with saved sinners. However, in the Bible there is something much more meaningful than mansions in heaven. It is that the glorious Christ, the universal Man, needs a bride. God said it is not good for Christ to be alone. Christ needs a bride.<h2 class=head1>THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE TYPIFIED IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2><p>In what way does God prepare the bride for Christ? We must look at the type. The types are pictures. Little children in kindergarten like books with pictures. If you tell children about a dog, they may still wonder what a dog is, but if you show them a picture of a dog, immediately they get the idea.<p>Genesis 2 gives us a picture of how the bride comes into existence. After Adam was created, God looked at him and said, &#8220;It is not good for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper as his counterpart&#8221; (v. 18). God then brought all the cattle, beasts, and birds before Adam to see what he would name them. When Adam saw the dog, he may have said, &#8220;No. This is not my counterpart. This is a dog.&#8221; When God brought the cat to Adam, he might have looked at himself and said, &#8220;I have two legs, but this creature has four legs. This is not my counterpart. This is a cat.&#8221; In this way he named each of the living creatures. However, Adam did not find anything that matched him. This must have been a disappointment to Adam.<p>After this, God caused Adam to sleep, opened his side, took a rib, and with the rib built a woman (vv. 21-23). God then brought the woman to Adam. When Adam saw the woman, he seemed to say, &#8220;This is my counterpart. I am a man and she is a woman.&#8221; Adam and Eve were a couple. Eve, the bride, was produced from something coming out of Adam to be his increase. When a young man is single, he has no increase, but when he is married, he has an increase. In the same way, Eve was the increase of Adam. The bride is the increase of the man, the increase of the bridegroom.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> </body></html>
