   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The first half of Ezekiel 28:14 says that he is "the anointed cherub that covereth."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Anointed indicates that he is consecrated.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The work of the cherubim is to lead men to worship the Lord Rev 4:9-10; 5:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, his work in the beginning was also to lead the creatures at that time in the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This also refers to his priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The latter part of verse 14 says that he was "upon the holy mountain of God" and had "walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The holy mountain of God probably is the place where God's glory is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the priest of God, he would, of course, stand before Him to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What does it mean to walk "up and down in the midst of the stones of fire"?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ezekiel 1:26 reveals that the position of the cherubim is below the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now when Moses took seventy of the elders of Israel up the mountain of Sinai, "they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness...And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire on the top of the mount" Exo 24:10, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The paved work of sapphire stone in the appearance of devouring fire probably was "the stones of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that Satan enjoyed a very high place, right below the throne of God, and was very intimate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 15 says that he was perfect in his ways from the day that he was created, but that later God found iniquity in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All of God's creation was perfect; God is not the author of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Iniquity was initiated by the archangel who sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was created and given a free will by God just as we were.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Unfortunately God's created angel abused his freedom!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And how many people are still following his footsteps!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first part of verse 16 says that by the multitude of his merchandise they have filled his midst with violence, and he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may refer this word solely to Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the end time commerce will be very prosperous Rev 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many sinful things will be brought in because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This can be proven by history.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, the same clause may be applied to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mr. Pember points out that "the word translated merchandise' may also...signify detraction' or slander'; and we know that the very name Devil' means the slanderer,' or malignant accuser'" Earth's Earliest Ages, p.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>52 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, we can find out the meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We see how Satan accused Job and tried to destroy him with insidious acts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Also in Revelation 12:10 we read, "Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The casting down here probably corresponds to the casting of Satan out of the mountain of God in Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The reason for the casting out in Ezekiel and in Revelation is one and the same, that is, accusation or slander .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Perhaps what was recorded in Ezekiel was the conviction of Satan by God and what was written in Revelation was the sending of Michael by God for the execution of that conviction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then why would God still allow Satan to remain in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The reasons seem to be: 1 the time of God has not yet come, and 2 His own children need the furnace to purge away the dross still in them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Ezekiel 28:17 reveals the cause of Satan's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His heart was lifted up because of his beauty, and his wisdom was corrupted by reason of his brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The king of Babylon as described in Isaiah 14:12-14 bears much resemblance to this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many servants of God believe that the Holy Spirit is not only pointing out the king of Babylon, but in a deeper sense, the cause of the fall of Satan who was behind the king of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In my view, the record in Ezekiel reveals the cause of his pride, while in Isaiah it shows the manner in which he exhibited his pride.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is probable that after comparing himself with God's other creatures, his heart was lifted up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the end he tried to exalt himself to be equal with God and thus suffered God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"How you have fallen from heaven, / O Daystar, son of the dawn!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>/...But you, you said in your heart: / I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>/ And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / On the sides of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>/ I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will be like the Most High" Isa 14:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Since he was so proud, God punished him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His authority in the heavens was removed and abolished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The remaining part of the prophecy in Ezekiel is not relevant to our subject, and we shall stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From the prophecy contained in this passage in Ezekiel, if our interpretation is correct, we can see how God created Satan the fairest and wisest of all His creatures in the former world and made him their leader.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God placed him in the garden of Eden, which was long before the Eden of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The things in the former garden, if not altogether different from those of the latter garden, were at least more numerous than the latter.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They resemble the future New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was a prophet there, teaching all the inhabitants of the earth with his wisdom to know how to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was also there as the priest of God, directing them in the worship and praises of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was also the king among the creatures, having been placed in a position that was above all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He must have been in such a condition for a lengthy period of time v. 15 , but because of his sin, he became the greatest enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So far we have covered the origin of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We shall now proceed to cover Satan's angels and demons, which are under him, and to investigate how they fell and how this affected the earth, causing it to become waste and void.</S>
