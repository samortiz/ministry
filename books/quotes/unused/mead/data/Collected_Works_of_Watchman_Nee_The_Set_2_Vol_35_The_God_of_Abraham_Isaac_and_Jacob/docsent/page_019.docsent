   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"THY SEED"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 15:5 says, "And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word "seed" refers to his descendant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is singular, not plural, in number.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very strange because humanly speaking, if his descendants were to be as numerous as the stars in heaven, "seed" should have been plural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when God was telling Abraham of the multiplicity of his descendants, He used the word "seed" in the singular.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why does He use the singular form of the word?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who was the one seed?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Galatians 3:16, Paul said, "He does not say, And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one: And to your seed,' who is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the seed that God referred to was not many people, but one person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This person was not Isaac, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us that the One who inherits the land is the one seed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As far as Abraham was concerned, the seed was Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in a wider context, the seed is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaac was just a shadow; the substance is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, Christ will inherit the land and bless the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both power and authority are with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's work of recovery is carried out by Christ, not by Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The matter of sonship is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this matter of sonship and the seed is not settled, no one can carry out God's recovery work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If Abraham was not brought to the point of perfection, he could not have brought in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham first had to become a vessel before Isaac could be brought in. This means that the glorious Christ will be brought in only when a group of people believe as Abraham believed; only then will God's work be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaac was merely a shadow; the reality is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same way, Abraham was a shadow; the reality is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as Abraham became a vessel to bring in Isaac, so the church is a vessel to bring in the glorious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wanted Abraham to become a vessel to bring in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The descendants of Abraham will fulfill God's purpose; Abraham himself did not fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the church is nothing in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is important is that the church brings in Christ and expresses Christ on earth for the recovery of all God's work on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abraham was a vessel to bring in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the church is a vessel to bring in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE FIRST TEST THE BIRTH OF ISHMAEL</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not a simple thing to usher in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Abraham had to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order for us to be God's vessel, bring in Christ, and express His authority, there must be many tests.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After Genesis 15, the Bible shows us that Abraham was tested three times concerning his son just as he was tested three times concerning the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Two of these tests occurred before the birth of his son, and one occurred after his birth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All three tests prepared Abraham for the ushering in of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In other words, the church must be tested and prepared before it can bring back the glorious Christ to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Chapter fifteen tells us that Abraham said to the Lord, "God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God said, "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Abraham believed in God, and God counted it to him for righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The promise of begetting a son was there, and the faith was there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, day after day, there was no son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Month after month, there was no son, and year after year, there was no son.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This shows us that faith has to be tested.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Abraham's faith grew step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Genesis 16:1 says, "Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bare him no children."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was now eighty-five years old.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His wife Sarah could not bare him a son.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At that juncture, his wife said to him, "Behold now, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid; it may be that I may obtain children by her" v. 2 . What did Abraham do? "Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar her maid the Egyptian...and gave her to her husband" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Bible specifically says that "Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan" v. 3 . When Abraham first arrived in Canaan, God promised, "Unto thy seed will I give this land" 12:7 . Just before these events God promised him again, "He that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir." By the time he was eighty-five years old, however, he still had no son.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He became anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to have a son, he went in unto Hagar as his concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hagar became pregnant and brought forth Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Bible specifically says, "And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare Ishmael to Abram" 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God ordained that Abraham would beget a son, but His ordination was for Abraham to beget a son through Sarah and that he would beget him at the age of one hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, Abraham shortened the time by fourteen years with his own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Moreover, the son was begotten through Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This was the first test that Abraham faced concerning his son.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He believed in God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He believed that God would give him a son.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Yet he did not realize that believing meant to stop his own activities and wait on God's work!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As soon as we believe, we should stop our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hebrews 4:10 says, "For he who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His own."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we believe, we should not make haste.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Whenever we believe, we should be at rest.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Abraham believed in God, yet he did not learn his lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He did not see that if he had believed, he should have waited and should not have done anything by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He thought that in order to believe, he should help God and do something by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Consequently, he accepted his wife's word, took Hagar to be his concubine, and bore Ishmael.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Abraham gave God a hand!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He thought that since God had promised a son, he would fulfill God's will by doing this!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He did not do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All he did was act on his own concerning something that God had promised him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But this one act brought about his failure!</S>
