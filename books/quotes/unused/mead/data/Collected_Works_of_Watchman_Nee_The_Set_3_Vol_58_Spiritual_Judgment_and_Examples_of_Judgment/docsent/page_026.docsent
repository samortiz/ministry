   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTEEN EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 12 Date:July 6, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER S. Y.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was saved in 1935 despite opposition from my parents.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 1936 I turned to the local church and enjoyed the sweetness of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I consecrated myself to the Lord and became very desirous of the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That year I quit my job at the hospital and returned to my village to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because I was not trained, my work produced very superficial results.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For two and a half years I preached the gospel and took care of sick patients on the side.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>My initial zeal toward the Lord gradually cooled down.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I learned the lesson and realized that everything should have its source in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even my zeal should not be from myself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I started a clinic with a friend and began to preach the gospel again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I had only one desire, which was to please the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I did not care about men's opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I read many of the publications of the Shanghai Gospel Book Room, and they suited my taste.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I feel that there is still something wrong with my person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others have gained something, but I have not gained anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I used to be an active person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now I no longer dare to be so active.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Recently I picked up a desire for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My inner sense has become more sensitive now.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is my condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT The Need for the Sense of Light to Increase</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have nothing special to say concerning your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I can only say that for a period of time you should take bold strides in your walk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should not take any more detours.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, you should take the straight course, the fast course.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no more time to look back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Additionally, I have two things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, the sense of light within you should increase.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If your inner being is not shining, you will not have proper feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your inner feelings are the basis of judging others.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the inner feelings increase, it means you have the proper organ to contact God and to judge men.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will bring you spiritual discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When your deposit increases, you will become useful to God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once the light shines within and the inward consciousness increases, you will spontaneously know whether others are right or wrong when you contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have to ask for more light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once you have the light, you will be clear, and when you are clear, you will have feelings and know how to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone has to learn to judge men, but you first must be judged by the light before you can identify others' mistakes and render them the proper judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not expect to help others by saying a few words extemporaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You must have a particularly discerning spirit before the help you render to others can be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The degree to which others receive your help, however, is up to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Being Delivered from One's Own Feelings</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second, you have to be delivered from your own feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In your going on with the Lord, your feelings have to follow your will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You should not be affected by your feelings, or else you will not be able to finish a year's course in ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is like a broken twig which flows from a stream to the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If it is entangled constantly with obstacles in the stream, it will take a long time before it reaches the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some people are too sensitive to things in their lives such as money, criticism, or judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These things are like obstacles in the stream, preventing the twig from flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are two kinds of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some have no feelings at all; they are insensitive to everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others have too many feelings, and they are handicapped in their going on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A profusion of feelings takes over their whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our going on with the Lord should not have too much to do with our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is a joy and enjoyment to follow God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are led by our feelings, we waste much time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We may end up spending five years doing what could have been done in one year.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not be running the race with the burden of our own feelings on our shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a man wants to believe in the Lord but will not commit himself until he first has joy and peace, we should say to him, "Believe first.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not seek for a feeling of joy and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After you have believed, feelings of joy and peace will come to you."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to abide by this principle for the rest of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We believe first and then, after a period of time, feelings of joy and peace will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Philippians is a book on rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Paul gave us a commandment which is hard to find anywhere in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He said, "Rejoice."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Rejoicing typically involves feelings; it is not a matter of will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the world, joy is controlled by the feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But for believers, joy is controlled by the will.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When the Lord says, "Rejoice," we should say, "All right, I will rejoice."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>An unbeliever cannot rejoice when he is asked to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Christians, however, can bring their feelings under the control of their will.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can rejoice when we need to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When Paul said to the Ephesians, "Be strong" KJV , he meant that they should be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everything relates to the will.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brothers and sisters, if we are chained by our feelings, we will need ten years to take a year's journey.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A soldier cannot say that he will not fight today because he does not feel good or happy or because he is depressed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When a soldier is called to fight, he has to fight, no matter how he feels or what his temperament is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The same is true of spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Today most children of the Lord follow their feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The most stable feeling is peace, the most intense feeling is joy, and the most fierce feeling is temper.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We cannot be bound or hindered by these feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We have to follow the will and be led by the will.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we do this, we will be able to run the race swiftly.</S>
