From the Sheep or Lamb</H2><P>The portions of the peace offering which are offered to God are also from the sheep or lamb (Lev. 3:9-11). These portions are the same as from the ox plus the whole fat tail. The King James Version uses the word rump, but the Hebrew word means fat tail. The American Standard Version says that the entire "fat tail" of the peace offering is offered to God. The fat tail and the fat upon the inwards again refer to the sweet and tender parts of Christ's being. No human can apprehend this portion. It can be realized and enjoyed only by the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. From the Goat</H2><P>The portions of the peace offering offered to God from the goat are the same as from the ox (3:14-16). All these portions, signifying the tender, sweet, and delicious parts of Christ, are for God. They are God's portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To the Offering Priest</H2><P>This is the second category of the portions of the peace offering. The first is the portion to God, and the second is the portion to the offering priest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. One Cake as a Heave Offering unto the Lord</H2><P>When the children of Israel offered a peace offering according to God's requirements, they did not need to offer any cakes. God required only the cattle for the peace offering. But if the offerer was thankful to God and offered it for a thanksgiving, he had to add something to the required peace offering. This portion is composed not of the cattle but of the cakes. According to Leviticus 7:14, out of the many cakes offered, one had to be set apart and heaved unto God as a heave offering. This became the portion of the offering priest, the conducting and serving priest, the priest who offered the blood and the fat.</P><P>Leviticus 7:13 and 14 say, "With the thanksgiving sacrifice of his peace offering, he shall offer his offering with cakes of leavened bread; and from it he shall offer one from each offering as a heave offering to Jehovah; it shall be for the priest who dashes the blood of the peace offering." Every time the serving priest offered a peace offering for thanksgiving, he had to take out one cake for a heave offering. If he offered an offering, he had to take out one piece from all the cakes and heave it unto the Lord. Then this piece would become his portion.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
