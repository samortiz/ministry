   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRESENT PRACTICE IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PREACHING THE GOSPEL, NOURISHING THE NEW ONES,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TEACHING THE TRUTH, AND BUILDING UP THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In our practice we must take care of the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First we need to spread the high gospel and bring people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Next we need to build up the home meetings and nourish the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then we need to build up the small groups and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Finally we must edify and perfect the new ones to be the same as we are, practicing the Body life in all the local churches for the Lord to gain a full-grown, mature Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These are the four things that we need to attain in our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we all see this clearly, we will be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot stay in the past; there is no future in that kind of standing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That vision and that practice are short.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With only that vision there is no preaching of the gospel and no teaching of the truth; there is only the bearing of the cross, the dealing and breaking of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What kind of future will this narrow view afford us?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am very clear concerning the responsibility that the Lord has given me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>More or less I am a leading one, and I must bear great responsibility for the things I say and do, because they affect hundreds, even tens of thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the future I must give an account to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this very reason I have observed the situation very much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some emphasize the preaching of the cross, but there is not much practice with them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When they want to lose their temper, they still lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not preach the gospel, they do not nourish and perfect others, and they do not pursue after the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The cross is merely a doctrine to them.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not care for mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to see the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we have seen, the vision that matches the age is the vision that extends all the way from Genesis to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we need to consider the proper practice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Matthew 24:14 says, This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we must do everything we can today to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should spend every cent and every drop of our sweat, tears, and blood on the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only this will satisfy the Lord and take care of His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The little island of Taiwan has twenty million people, but there are only five hundred thousand Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are we sitting still, not willing to be on fire for the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are, how can we give an account to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I believe one day, when we stand before the judgment seat of the Lord, He will ask us, You have been in Taiwan for so long.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What was your attitude toward My gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He will tell us that He was not a hard Master, that He had given us a talent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But how did we use it, and how much did we use it?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How many people did we bring to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How many people did we nourish and care for?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>How many people did we teach?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the future we will need to answer these questions one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Matthew 24 and 25 show that one day we will have to stand before the Lord and give an account item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I admit that my responsibility is greater than yours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I also will have to stand before Him to give an account of myself, but I cannot give an account on your behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today you have risen up and have responded to my leading, and I thank and praise the Lord for this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I worship the Lord for you, but you need to be clear that you are not following me.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You are following this ultimate and completed vision, and you are spreading the gospel according to the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No one can say that he does not know how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Matthew 28:19 says, Go therefore and disciple all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This commandment is to all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Bible has never said that some are exempt from preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are faithful to the Lord in the matter of the gospel, and if we are diligent, the number of believers in the churches will greatly increase in a country as densely populated as Taiwan, but if we do not do anything, we will have nothing to say when we face the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who are sitting here today are either co-workers, elders, or full-timers who are learning to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please consider calmly: If we cannot save one or two people within a year in an island as populous as Taiwan, how are we going to give an account to the Lord when we see Him?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If each of us brings one to the Lord in a year, in a short time we will reach the goal of gospelizing Taiwan, but if we all hold back our energy, how can we gospelize this country?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the parable of Matthew 20, the householder went out and said to the idle workmen, Why have you been standing here all the day idle? v. 6 . All those who do not participate in the gospel move, even if they are pursuing spirituality and are knowledgeable in the truth, are idle in the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today when we speak concerning the one accord, we are not speaking concerning a certain method that we must practice.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are saying that we should be attuned to the Lord s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord s heart is that we enter the vineyard and labor for His gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are attuned to the Lord s heart, and if we dispense the Triune God to others, imparting to them the Lord s life so that they become His members and are constituted to be His Body as His full expression, then spontaneously we will be in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>THE PRESENT NEED BEING IN ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>AND BEING FAITHFUL IN COORDINATION</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The preaching of the gospel is the first step in the spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Following this we need to have home meetings and the nourishing of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We also need to build up the small groups and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Finally, we need to have the practical manifestation of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These four things must become the family tradition among the churches in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In order to develop this tradition, we must have the same view and the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is reason that I have presented to you the matter of the ultimate and completed vision.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today we should no longer emphasize different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should not have any different leadings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are all in the Lord s recovery, and we have all seen today s concluded vision.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even if some cannot follow and do not see clearly, they should not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As long as they follow, they will obtain the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The sons of Noah did not see the vision that he saw, yet they were in one accord with their father.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They closely followed him, and they were saved in the same way that their father was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Peter was also one who blindly followed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He did not know anything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He only knew that the vision was with the Lord, and he followed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the end he received the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we have different emphases and different ways of doing things, our energy will be dissipated, and our faith will be weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We will lose the one accord, and our morale will be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, if we are in one accord and we preach the gospel desperately, we will become hotter and hotter; our mutual burning will heighten our determination.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Even the new ones will be brought into the proper function.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We will have an invincible morale, and we will march over all obstacles.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Wherever we go, we will more than conquer.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is what we must have today.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Do not ask why we did not do this ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Ten years ago we were not as clear as we are today regarding the way of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Thank the Lord that His leading is always progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If a child does not grow in ten years, he must be sick with some terrible illness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If I am still teaching the same thing as I did ten years ago, you may think that I have not grown.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are not changing our way.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>During the past twenty-three years that I was in America, I did not change my tone.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Faced with all the opposition and attacks, I stood firm on the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, we are advancing and spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Today our work has to advance because the vision that the Lord has given us has advanced.</S>
