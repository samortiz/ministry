   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: O Lord, we bow our heads in worship to You, for everything depends upon Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You will have mercy on whomever You will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We worship You that in Your recovery, for over seventy years from the past up to the present, You have never stopped Your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have even given us unprecedented light to see how You carry out Your ministry in three stages in the age of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We worship You for these three precious stages of Yours the stage of Your becoming the flesh, the stage of Your becoming the life-giving Spirit, and the stage of Your becoming the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thank You for showing us the particular things performed by You in each stage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>O Lord, You have been so patient to wait until today for us to be ready in this last age to see Your ministry in these three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>O Lord, speak a clear word again to us this morning.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, we pray that You would quiet our heart and open our spirit that we may be pure in heart and poor in spirit to be willing to receive Your word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We pray that You would be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Also, we accuse Your enemy, we condemn him, and we bind and destroy him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TO KNOW CHRIST PARTICULARLY IN FOUR ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning how to be a co-worker and an elder, there are two precious points: first, to know Christ and second, to experience and enjoy Christ in His full ministry in His three divine and mystical stages.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To know Christ is very general.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is too rich, and His riches are unsearchable, so how can we know Him?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the preceding messages we saw that there are many items of all that Christ is, but there are four of them in particular that we need to know.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, we need to know particularly that He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Over forty years ago, a co-worker among us said that Christ was a man until He went to the cross and that after His resurrection, He was no longer a man, because He put off His humanity when He passed through death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is altogether wrong to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The New Testament tells us clearly that after His resurrection, Christ in His ascension is the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power Matt 26:64 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At his martyrdom, Stephen saw Christ as the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God Acts 7:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord also told us personally that, in His coming back, He will be the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven Matt 26:64 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, Revelation tells us that Christ is the Son of Man as the High Priest taking care of God's lampstands 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It also shows us that He will come back to reap His harvest as the Son of Man sitting on the cloud 14:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only so, the Gospel of John tells us that in eternity Christ as the ladder is the Son of Man, on whom the angels of God ascend and descend 1:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This shows us that for eternity Christ will still be the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, it is a great heresy either to deny that the Lord Jesus is the Son of Man or to say that He was the Son of Man only until His death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Second, we need to know particularly that Christ possesses both divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must know this in order to be able to interpret the New Testament in a logical manner.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Hebrews says that, as our great High Priest, Christ can be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, because He has been tempted in all respects like us 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If He had only divinity without humanity, how could He have been tempted?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Who can tempt God?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, to deny that Christ possesses both divinity and humanity is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Third, we have to know particularly that in His humanity Christ accomplished His judicial redemption through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is true that Christianity teaches people that Christ accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The average people in Christianity, however, cannot say that Christ, in His humanity, accomplished His judicial redemption through His death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this statement, the modifiers such as "in His humanity," "judicial," and "through His death" are very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Such expressions show that we know the redemption of Christ in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Fourth, we need to know particularly that in His divinity Christ is carrying out His organic salvation in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The judicial redemption has been accomplished, whereas the organic salvation is being carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to know Christ particularly in the above four points.</S>
