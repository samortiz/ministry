   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LEDGE OF THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>UNDER WHICH THE GRATING OF BRONZE IS HUNG</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning the ledge, we may also say that the ledge signifies the strengthening power upholding Christ under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ was upheld by this strengthening power while He was on the cross suffering the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The acacia wood overlaid with bronze signifies Christ in His humanity under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No doubt, at the time of the crucifixion, the Lord Jesus needed strengthening, upholding, covering, and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that the ledge in the altar served this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen that the ledge probably protected the acacia wood inside the bronze covering from the heat of the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without some kind of protection, the acacia wood certainly would have been charred by the heat transmitted through the bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fire in the altar was burning continually, week after week and month after month.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It would be impossible for the heat not to damage the acacia wood unless the wood was protected in some way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, I believe that the ledge also served the purpose of protecting the acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This may be the reason that in Exodus 27 we are told that the grating was under the ledge of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fact that the acacia wood could withstand the burning indicates that it was possible for Christ in His humanity to bear the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>THE POLES OF THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Exodus 27:6 and 7 say, And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood; and you shall overlay them with bronze.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And its poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles shall be upon the two sides of the altar when it is carried.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The poles were for the move of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They were made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze, signifying Christ as a man under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These poles were put into the rings, signifying the move of the cross by the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, the poles upon the two sides of the altar were to be carried by men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This signifies the move of the cross by the coordination of the believers as a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The poles in the rings are a strong evidence that the altar was to be carried by men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was not to be placed on a wagon or carried by animals.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The altar was to be borne on men s shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the preaching of the cross must be done by human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But those who preach the cross must do so in coordination as a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was the reason the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples to preach two by two.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In coordination and as a testimony, the believers are to carry the redemption of Christ by the power of the Spirit to the four corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>XIV.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>MADE WITH PLANKS TO BE HOLLOW: ITS SIZE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>SUFFICIENT TO CONTAIN</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>ALL THE UTENSILS OF THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Verse 8 says, You shall make it hollow with planks; as it was shown to you in the mountain, so they shall make it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The altar was made with planks to be hollow and of a size sufficient to contain all the utensils of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This signifies that the cross of Christ contains all our experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The initial experience of the cross of Christ at the time we were regenerated is the base of all our subsequent experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>All our experiences of Christ are based upon the principle of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The burden in this message is related to the Spirit for both burning and moving.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is very meaningful and significant that Christ bore God s judgment inwardly even more than outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, the eternal Spirit is linked to Christ s full redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This Spirit is for the burning within and also for the moving without.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today the cross must be preached in the way of burning and moving through the eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We who preach the cross must be living persons in coordination bearing a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we shall be qualified to carry the altar in its journey on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The altar is still being carried today.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It has the burning inwardly, and it is moving outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Praise the Lord for the grating, signifying the inner content of Christ s redemption!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise Him also that we have the grating and the rings!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have the eternal Spirit for burning and moving.</S>
