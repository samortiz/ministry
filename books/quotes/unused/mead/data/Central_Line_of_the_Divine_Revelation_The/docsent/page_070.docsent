   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>R. As the Spirit of the Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Body of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being the Essence of the Body</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit is the oneness of the Body of Christ, being the essence of the Body, which is constituted with Christ as the element, out from the origin of God the Father, to consummate the mingling of the Triune God with the Body of Christ through the divine dispensing Eph 4:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ is the element of the Body, and the Spirit is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This element is out from the origin of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, with the Body of Christ, the Father is the origin, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the Triune God the origin, the element, and the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These three are blended and mingled with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Body of Christ, the church, is four in one: the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Body the Spirit is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The essence needs the element, which is the Lord Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The element must have an origin, a source, which is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Father is the source, the origin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Out of the Father there is the element, and within the element there is the essence.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is the origin, the Son is the element, the Spirit is the essence, and the Body is the very constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These are four-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, only the first three are worthy of our worship; the fourth, the Body, should not be deified as an object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit as the oneness of the Body of Christ is the essence of the Body to consummate the mingling of the Triune God with the Body of Christ through the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today something is going on to mingle the Father as the origin, the Son as the element, and the Spirit as the essence with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This mingling is continuing today and will be consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit is the essence of the Body to consummate this mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>S. As the Consummation of the Processed God, Sanctifying Us with the Divine</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and Holy Nature of God</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit is the consummation of the processed God, sanctifying us with the divine and holy nature of God that we may be separated and made holy unto God Rom 6:19b, 22b; 15:16b; 1 Thes 5:23; 2 Pet 1:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit today is a consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This Spirit is sanctifying us with the divine and holy nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This sanctifying is surely a dispensing of the divine and holy nature of God into our being that we may be separated and made holy unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The nature of God is the very element with the essence of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With this essence we can be and will be sanctified unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>T. As the Regenerating Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Renewing Us with the Newness</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>of Christ's Resurrection Life and with</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>the Freshness of the Ever-existing God</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The all-inclusive Spirit is the regenerating Spirit, renewing us with the newness of Christ's resurrection life and with the freshness of the ever-existing God as the green fir tree Titus 3:5; Eph 4:23; Rom 12:2a; 6:4; Hosea 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Regeneration is a renewing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The regenerating SpiNrit renews us with the newness of Christ's resurrection life and with the freshness of the ever-existing God as the green fir tree.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hosea 14:8 tells us that God is like a fir tree, which is green the year round.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This greenness is a kind of freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need the newness of Christ's resurrection life, and we need the freshness of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The regenerating Spirit renews us with these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This renewing is also a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without the dispensing of the newness of Christ and of the freshness of God, we could never be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To be renewed, we need some element, and that element is the newness of Christ and the freshness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By all the foregoing items we can see that whatever this life-giving, compounded, all-inclusive Spirit does is a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Primarily, He dispenses Christ as God's embodiment with all His experiences of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Spirit dispenses this triune processed God into our being that He may be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God.</S>
