   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE NATURAL STRENGTH AND ABILITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BECOMING USEFUL IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR OUR SERVICE TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The natural strength and ability are useful if they are dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After being dealt with by the cross, they are in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some brothers speak in their natural eloquence, but other brothers speak with an eloquence dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the eloquence in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some who are short of experience may ask what the difference is between the natural eloquence and the eloquence in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is hard to explain, but if you have the experience, it is easy to discern.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only those with the experience can discern the difference between the undealt with, natural strength and ability and the strength and ability in resurrection through the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In resurrection something divine has been wrought into our strength and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even some divine element has been wrought into our eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we speak, we need to have our eloquence dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The cross always works the divine element into the person it deals with, bringing God into him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have never been dealt with by the cross in your eloquence, that is the natural eloquence with nothing divine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if your eloquence has been dealt with, that kind of eloquence is in resurrection and is full of the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the natural eloquence, there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the "dealt with" eloquence in resurrection is full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After being dealt with, our strength and ability become useful in resurrection for our service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE CASE OF MOSES</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We surely need to gain ability, but once we have the ability, we need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This was exactly what happened to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The case of Moses is the best one to illustrate the matter of rejecting the natural strength and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No other person in the Bible is as good as Moses in this aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. Educated in All the Wisdom of the Egyptians and Being Powerful in Words and in Works</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Acts 7:22 tells us that Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in words and in works.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. Doing Something for God's People</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>according to His Own Will</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moses did something for God's people according to his own will Acts 7:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was full of assurance that he could accomplish something, but he was carrying out his will, not God's will.</S>
