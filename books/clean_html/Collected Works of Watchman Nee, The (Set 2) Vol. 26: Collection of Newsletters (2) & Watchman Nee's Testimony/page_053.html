<h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM SWATOW, KWANGTUNG PROVINCE</h2><p>Peace to my brother in the Lord, Yueh Chiao:</p><p>We weighed anchor on the twenty-sixth and arrived here on the twenty-ninth. God protected us on this trip; the winds and waves were calm on the entire voyage. We did not suffer any seasickness. We really thank the Lord who loves us!</p><p>I have no words to express my thanks to you for your loving care in the Lord while I stayed in Shanghai this time. I only hope that our rich God will reward you for your love.</p><p>Our three brothers, Watchman Nee, Ma Wen Chia, and Yu Wen P'o arrived here last night. They passed through Han Yang, Changsha, Nan Chang, Shao Kuan, and Chao An on their way to Swatow. It took them twenty-eight days. They were cared for by God along the way and arrived here safely. This is also something to thank the Lord about. They will probably stay for one week. There will be a meeting every night. All the brothers and sisters are very happy.</p><p>My whole family is well. Please do not worry about us, but continue to pray. Please greet the brothers&mdash;Witness, Wei Chih, Chin Chou, and Chin T'ang.

Thank you for asking after my health. I thank the Lord for His grace that I have gradually begun to get better. Please do not worry about me. With regard to the present condition of the work in northern Kiangsu, there was an open letter sent from Taichow to Mr. Nee. Have you received it yet? The letter talked about the condition of our work in each locality after returning from Hangchow. Please go to Mr. Nee's home and greet Mrs. Nee; then read the letter. On February 7, we began to have a gospel meeting every morning and an edification meeting for the brothers and sisters every afternoon. There is work in Taichow, Su Chia Tsui, Tung Kou, and Hsin Cheng. I pray that you do not forget to pray for this. May the Lord bless you with peace! Please greet the brothers and sisters who meet in Shanghai.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Wu Wei<br />February 7, 1935</p><h2 class="head1">NEWS FROM CH'IEN TS'ANG, P'ING YANG,<br />CHEKIANG PROVINCE</h2><p>Greetings to our brother in the Lord, Mr. Nee,</p><p> and all the brothers and sisters:</p><p>We really thank the Lord that in these last days He Himself has worked in P'ing Yang to manifest His truth and cause us to deeply feel the sin of sects, which do not have the real worship. Thank the Lord that He raised up a small number of brothers and sisters to leave the denominations in spirit even though we still met with them at that time. On the Lord's Day evening there are six brothers and sisters who break bread in one accord before the Lord's table. We have done this since the spring of 1934, when the Lord led us to completely separate from the denominations. On the first Lord's Day of the third month of the old calendar, we began to have meetings in the Lord's name in Brother Ma Hsien Yi's home. There were about fifteen men and women all together. Five brothers and five sisters partook of the table. After we had a meeting like this to worship the Lord, we were attacked and persecuted by the denominations. But it was the Lord's will that we follow in His footsteps to patiently stand firm. Brother Su Chih San was oppressed by his father. Sister Lin Chih Ming was misunderstood by her husband. Therefore, we prayed much for this. Thank the Lord, He freed Brother Su to worship the Lord. Only Sister Lin cannot be completely free now. Please pray for her.</p><p>In the seventh month of the old calendar, Brother Ma met with great difficulty. His eldest son (fourteen) died suddenly. Thank the Lord, he was already saved. Brother and Sister Ma were very sorrowful. After the Lord comforted them through the brothers and sisters, they were able to recover their former composure. May the Lord's victorious power swallow up the attacks of the enemy and keep the brothers and sisters in the way before them. May He also cause the brothers and sisters to stand firmly on the foundation. Brothers and sisters in the Lord, please do not forget to pray for us. May you have peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Su Chih San, Liu Hsing Kuang, Ma Hsien Yi<br />September 28, 1934</p><p>Mailing address: c/o Hsieh Yu Tai, Ch'ien Ts'ang, P'ing Yang, Chekiang province.</p>
