<h2 class="head1">THE OVERCOMING LIFE<br />BEING AN EXCHANGE, NOT A CHANGE</h2><p>My friends, have you seen this? You cannot do anything about yourself. You can only fail. Victory is Christ. We cannot make it, but Christ can make it. The problem with us is that even though we cannot make it, we try to bear the burden ourselves and refuse to let Christ bear it for us. Many people are ignorant of the way of victory. They only know how to seek after power and holiness. Little do they realize that when they have Christ, they have everything. Victory is a matter of substitution by Christ. We do not overcome by ourselves.</p><p>Please be very assured before the Lord of this fact: Victory is not a change in ourselves; it is Christ overcoming for us. The overcoming life is an exchange, not a change. It is not a change from our own failures to our own victories. We have failed, and God has terminated the defeated "I" through the cross. He has put the victorious Christ within us to live for us. Our life has been exchanged. We were defeated, but God has put Christ within us and has replaced our "I" with "Christ" so that now we can overcome. The secret to victory is in the little word exchange. Many people hope to change, but no matter how hard they try, they are still themselves! Only when Christ lives for us within will we experience victory.</p><p>Two years ago I spoke about the subject of victory in Chefoo. I said that victory is not a matter of changing our lives. It is not a changed life, but an exchanged life. Man only wants to change himself. But in God's eyes, we are wicked beyond hope. We are thoroughly corrupted, and there is no way for us to be changed. Every kind of sin dwells within man. All the sins of the world dwell within us. We should not say that others can be robbers and prostitutes and that we cannot. We can commit any sin. We do not commit them because by God's mercy we are not faced with that environment and temptation. God has crucified our old man through the cross of the Lord, and Christ is living within us to be our victory. Our life is totally exchanged; it is not changed.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S SALVATION BEING<br />FOR CHRIST TO LIVE FOR US</h2><p>Once, over ten years ago, I had six dollars in my pocket, and I bought a watch for myself, which cost five dollars and eighty cents. It was a watch with a famous American brand name. When I purchased it, I was given a certificate of warranty, guaranteeing free service and maintenance on the watch for two years from the date of purchase. I took the watch home, and on the second day, it was off by two and a half hours. Other watches worked for twenty-four hours, but my watch only worked twenty-one and a half hours. I took it to the shop and asked them about it. The men said that they would fix it for me. After two days I took the watch home, but it was an hour off after only one day. I took the watch back for repair, and it was supposedly fixed. After I took it home again, it was in the same position after just one day; it had not moved at all. I again took the watch back and asked why it did not work. The men could only say, "Okay. Do not complain anymore. We will fix it for you." I took the watch home a week later, and the next day I noticed that it was three hours faster. I took it back and said, "I have had this watch for just twenty days. But fourteen of these days, it has been in your shop. I had it for only six days. Is this watch yours or is it mine? Since you cannot fix it, can I exchange it for another one?" The men insisted that there was no such guarantee; the warranty only guaranteed that they would fix it. If the watch broke down, I could bring it back to the shop as often as needed, and they would fix it until the two-year period expired.</p><p>My friends, do you see what I am talking about? Repair and exchange are two different things. Repairing something is fixing something that is broken. But exchanging something is turning in the old thing for something new. God's way of salvation is the way of exchange. Man wants God to give him the strength to do good, but a broken watch cannot be changed into a good one no matter how much one tries to fix it. The only way is to exchange it for a new one. God's way of salvation is not to help us overcome, but for Christ to overcome in our place. Have you seen what Galatians 2:20 is about? It is simply us not living; our living has nothing to do with us. It is no longer us, but Christ who lives in us. This is substitution. Victory has nothing to do with us. We have nothing to do with victory itself. Christ is living for us and living out of us. It is not a matter of living by Christ, through Christ, because of Christ, or by the power of Christ. It is a matter of not being us at all. We have absolutely no part; Christ is living on our behalf.</p>
