The difference between covenants and grace is the difference between law and grace. For example, if refugees came to us asking for relief during a flood, we could do as we pleased. If we wanted to, we could help them. If we did not want to, we would not have to help them. We would have absolute freedom. If we had mercy on them, we could send some relief to them. If we did not have mercy on them and did not send any relief to them, no one could force us to do anything. We would have complete liberty to do whatever we wanted to do. But if we made a covenant with them to supply them with food and drink for three months, then we would have to begin preparing food for them today. My friends, that would not be just grace. Giving them food yesterday would be a matter of grace. Giving them food today, even though it could be considered grace, is actually a matter of righteousness, justice, and law. It would not be grace alone. We are carrying out a promise that we made yesterday. We are just carrying out our covenant today. If we do not give them food today, we are being more than unmerciful, we are being unrighteous. What has been promised must be done. God has made covenants with us; He has promised us. If God does not work according to His promise, what will become of Him? If He does not do this, He would be unfaithful, dishonest, and unrighteous. If God has not promised us anything, we can only say that He does not have the grace to give or the mercy to grant to us. But if He does not fulfill His promise, He would be unrighteous. Who can say that God is unrighteous? God would rather lose His freedom; He can never lose His righteousness.</P><P>Now let us consider some covenants made in the Bible, and see how covenants are different from facts and promises. First we will consider Hebrews 6:13-18 which says that there are two things that cannot be changed, God's promise and His oath. Abraham was greatly encouraged by this. When God made a covenant with Abraham, He gave him two unchangeable things. One was an unchangeable promise. The other was an unchangeable oath. Let us see how God gave a promise and an oath to Abraham.</P><P>Please read Genesis 15:1-13. This portion of the Word records God's promise to Abraham of descendants and land. God said to him, "Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward" (v. 1). When Abraham heard it, he said, "Lord God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?" (v. 2). This word shows that Abraham did not yet believe in God's promise. God said to him, "This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir" (v. 4). Verse 6 says, "And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness." Friends, please pay attention to this verse. What did the Lord tell Abraham? He told him a promise, not a fact. God promised Abraham that he would have a son, and his seed would be numerous. The Lord asked if he could count the number of the stars and told him that the number of his seed would be as the stars. This is not a fact, but a promise. At that time Abraham did not have a son, and the promise was not yet fulfilled. Abraham believed God's promise. God was pleased with him and justified him. Abraham became a giant of faith.</P><P>God has His promises for us. If we believe in them, we will become extraordinary people. We are all limited in our capacity. God's promises are too great, and it seems that we cannot hold them. We may be able to believe one promise of God. But we are not able to believe in the second and the third promises because of the smallness of our faith. We may think that it is a tremendous thing to believe in one promise, and that this is enough. We may think that we cannot believe in another promise and that we do not have the capacity to receive greater blessings. But if we can believe in God's first promise, He will right away give us a second promise.</P><P>God took Abraham outside and told him to look toward heaven and count the stars. Could he count them? Then God said to him, "So shall thy seed be." Abraham believed this promise. As a result, God's second promise came. Verse 7 says, "I am the Lord that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it." God not only promised that Abraham's seed would be as numerous as the stars, He also promised that Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey, would be given to his seed. When Abraham heard this promise, what did he do? Unfortunately, his capacity was too small; he could not receive so much. Verse 8 says, "And he said, Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" Abraham doubted. The promise was too great. How could Abraham know that he would receive Canaan as his inheritance? How could he believe such a great promise? If God just told him that he would have families, he could believe that. But when God told him that he would have an inheritance, he could not believe. He could believe in seed as numerous as the stars in heaven. But he could not believe that he would inherit Canaan, and that his descendants would drive out the seven strong tribes and inherit their lands. Abraham could believe in God giving him the seeds, but he could not believe that he would inherit the land in addition to having the seed. Friends, we often commit the same mistake. We believe one promise of God, but do not believe another promise. If God promises us this, we believe it. But if He promises us that, we cannot believe it. We often choose what we want to believe and can believe from among the many promises of God. Those that we cannot believe, we do not believe. Some brothers believe that God can supply their needs, but do not believe that God will heal their sicknesses. Some believe that God will heal them, but do not believe that God will supply their needs. Some believe that God will heal them, but do not believe that God will protect and deliver them from dangers. It is even possible for some people to believe at one time, that God will deliver them from dangers, but later no longer believe in His deliverance. For example, when Elijah confronted the prophets of Jezebel on Mount Carmel, he fully believed that God would protect him from the harm of the enemy. He was bold to prevail over the false prophets. But soon after that, he became afraid of Jezebel's plot and escaped to Beersheba (1 Kings 19:3).</P><P>Many times we choose the things that we want to believe from among God's promises, believe them, and reject those that we do not believe. We believe some of God's promises but do not believe others. This is wrong. If we could believe what God has promised, like Abraham, everything would be well. What will God do when we cannot believe? He has promised, and He cannot break His promises. He has promised, but we cannot come up to His standing to receive these promises. Therefore, He has to lower Himself to our standing, so that we can receive His promises boldly.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 09: The Present Testimony (2) &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
