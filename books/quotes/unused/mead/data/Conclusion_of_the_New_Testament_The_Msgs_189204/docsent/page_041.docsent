   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Including Prophets and Teachers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 13:1 tells us that in the church in Antioch there were "prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon who was called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen, foster brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul."</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fact that the prophets and teachers here were composed of Jewish and Gentile peoples with different backgrounds, education, and status indicates that the church is composed of all races and classes of people regardless of their background, and that the spiritual gifts and functions given to the members of the Body of Christ are not based upon their natural status.</S>
