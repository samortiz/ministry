   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Work of Jesus Christ the God-man 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Preliminary Steps</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In doing anything, one must have some preparations.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One cannot do things directly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is the need of some preliminary steps.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>a. His Incarnation, Implied in</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>His Becoming the Seed of David</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first preliminary step for Christ s work was His incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is implied in His becoming the seed of David Rom 1:3; John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The eternal God, the complete God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit , came from eternity into time in the Triune God s divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Eternity has no beginning and no end. Suddenly, God inserted time into eternity, and time divides eternity into two parts eternity in the past and eternity in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ as God once remained in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then from that eternity past, He came out.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not forget this happened only about two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To our understanding this was a sudden thing, but not to God s understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To God s understanding this was something planned by Him in His economy before the foundation of the world, in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do not know how long He remained in eternity, but we do know that about two thousand years ago, He came out of eternity into time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came as God in the Triune God s divinity to be the flesh in its likeness but without sin Rom 8:3b .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He partook of the human blood and flesh in which Satan with sin is involved Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was to bring God into man, making God and man mingled as one person.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before His incarnation, God was there in heaven and men were here on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But about two thousand years ago, to our understanding, there was a surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suddenly God came with His divinity to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He brought God into man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God was brought into the womb of Mary to be conceived there and remain there for nine months.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, that conceiving became a birth to bring forth Jesus Christ, and this Jesus Christ is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was God conceived in a human womb, and after this conceiving He was born to be Jesus, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the God-man in the universe, as a model, a prototype, for the mass reproduction of many sons of God, for the accomplishment of God s eternal economy 1 Tim 1:4b .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This model, prototype, is a particular item in the universe which has never been seen in God s old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This item is the initiation of God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His Human Living, Implied in His Being a Man</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Living on the Earth for Thirty-three and a Half Years</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After being born as a God-man, He needed to live as such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His human living is implied in His being a man living on the earth for thirty-three and a half years Rom 5:15, 17, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was a living of obeying God Rom 5:19; Phil 2:8; John 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was a living through death dying to live Rom 5:19; Phil 2:8; John 7:6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It was also a living of righteousness before God Rom 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His human living qualified Him to be the Redeemer of the unrighteous men Rom 3:23-24; 1 Pet 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the preliminary steps of His incarnation and human living, we come to the two sections of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first section was in His earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second section is in His heavenly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In His Earthly Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After He walked through the preliminary steps of incarnation and human living, He began His earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In His earthly ministry He did mainly two things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He consummated His all-inclusive death, and He carried out the life-imparting and new-creation-germinating resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>a. Consummating the All-inclusive Death</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus Christ the God-man died a wonderful, marvelous, excellent death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Adam died a death which he did not like, but Christ died a death which He volunteered to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is His all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He consummated this all-inclusive death through His death in His flesh, body Col 1:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In His death He took away the sin of the world John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Jesus died on the cross to bear the transgressions and iniquities of God s chosen people Isa 53:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He died for the sins of the believers by bearing their sins the outward sins in their conduct on the cross 1 Cor 15:3; 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He condemned the inward sin brought by Satan into man s flesh in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Romans 8:3 says that sin was condemned in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This was for the believers redemption and justification Rom 3:23-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without such a death dealing with sin, we could not be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even the more, we could not be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>His all-inclusive death was also for the healing of the diseases of God s people Isa 53:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The New Testament tells us we were healed because of His suffering of death 1 Pet 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By this death He accomplished God s eternal redemption to bring God s people back to God Heb 9:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>By His all-inclusive death, He terminated the old creation signified by our old man our natural man , including our flesh Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20a; 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He also destroyed Satan, who is involved in our old and fallen man Heb 2:14; John 3:14; Matt 16:23; John 6:70-71 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He judged the world the cosmos of Satan and cast out Satan as the ruler of the world John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>His death was the death of the flesh, and this flesh is of the old creation, the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Within this flesh is Satan, the world, and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>So by this one all-inclusive death He terminated all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He ended the old creation and cleared up all the negative things in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Carrying Out the Life-imparting and</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>the New-creation-germinating Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>First, He did a work to accomplish His all-inclusive death to deal with all the negative things in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then He carried out the life-imparting and the new-creation-germinating resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He accomplished a death and carried out a resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The death is all-inclusive, and the resurrection is life-imparting and new-creation-germinating.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Jesus Christ, as the one grain of wheat, released the divine life within Him from the shell of His humanity John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>His death was a termination of the old universe.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Then His resurrection was a releasing of the divine life within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When God became flesh, His life was contained in a shell of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Christ s death on the cross broke that shell, destroyed that shell.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then the divine life which was concealed in that shell was released.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Thus, His death was the termination of everything negative, and His resurrection was the release of the divine life from the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In resurrection He, as the last Adam in His flesh, became was transfigured pneumatized into the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life Rom 8:2; 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He, in His humanity 1 Cor 15:45b , was born designated in the power of His divinity Rom 1:4 to be the firstborn Son of God in resurrection Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; Heb 1:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Christ has two parts: humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In humanity He died.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Then in resurrection He, in His humanity, was born, that is, designated, sonized, in the power of His divinity, which is mentioned as the Spirit of holiness in Romans 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The Spirit of holiness refers to the divinity of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Christ was born, designated, sonized, in the power of His divinity to be the firstborn Son of God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He regenerated His believers in His resurrection with Him in one great, corporate birth to be the many sons of God and His many brothers 1 Pet 1:3; Heb 2:10-12; John 20:17 , who, as the many sons of God, are to be conformed to the image of Him as the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This great birth was not just the birth of one or even ten children.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It was a great birth which delivered the firstborn Son of God and millions of sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In a sense, if you allow me to say so, you have to realize that you are a twin with Christ, because He is your firstborn Brother.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You were born with Him as His following brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We all were born, regenerated, in Christ s resurrection almost two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This is what we call our crystallization-study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The life-giving Spirit is the germinating factor of the Body of Christ as the new creation of God 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Christ as the firstborn Son of God and as the Head is the element and the believers as His many brothers are the constituents for God s building 1 Cor 3:9b the Body of Christ as the new creation of God consummating in the New Jerusalem Rev 21:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He is the element within us, the constituents, for God s building.</S>
