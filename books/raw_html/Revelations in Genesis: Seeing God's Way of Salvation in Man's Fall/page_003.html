        <h2 class="head2">The Woman&rsquo;s Assuming of the Headship</h2>
<p>In addition to the serpent&rsquo;s temptation, there was another cause of man&rsquo;s fall: the woman&rsquo;s assuming of the headship. Did God create one man or two? Some say that God created two people. This is not correct; God created one man. Eve was built with Adam&rsquo;s rib (2:22); hence, Eve&rsquo;s head was Adam. Therefore, there was only one head, not two. God did not create two people when He created man; He did not take one lump of dust to create Adam and another lump to create Eve. He created one man, Adam, from one lump of dust, took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side and built it into Eve, and put the two together to be one flesh (vv. 7, 21-24). Thus, there were not two but one.</p>
<p>Weddings are held all over the world, but few people understand their significance. Whether a wedding ceremony is modern or traditional, Chinese or Western, there is only one head. Why is only one head exposed when there are two people? Why does the woman cover her head? In my childhood I saw traditional Chinese weddings in which the bride covered her whole head. When the couple bowed to heaven and earth, I saw only one head, not two. Today people are accustomed to modern wedding ceremonies, but most brides, whether Chinese or Western, wear a veil. They wear a veil to declare that henceforth, in this new household, there are not two heads; rather, there is only one head. If both the husband and the wife are heads, they will fight and then divorce. Just as a country cannot have two rulers, a household cannot have two heads. When a sister gets married, she must let her husband be the head. Please do not misunderstand me and think that I am advocating men&rsquo;s rights for the brothers. This is not the case. I want you to know God&rsquo;s ways.</p>
<p>In traditional Chinese weddings the bride cannot tread on the ground when she goes from her household to her groom&rsquo;s household. The bride is usually carried from her room by her older brother to her bridal sedan chair. When she arrives at her groom&rsquo;s household, a felt carpet is spread for her as she gets out of her sedan chair. The groom may tread on the ground, but the bride may not. Although this practice is a Chinese tradition, it is very meaningful. The bride cannot tread on the ground, because she has no position on earth. Eve&rsquo;s position was in Adam; her position was Adam&rsquo;s side, and Adam was her head.</p>
<p>This word may anger the sisters; they may think that I am belittling the position of women. In this age of respecting women&rsquo;s rights in the twentieth century, to say that women have no position and that the man is the head of the woman sounds like a backward theory. I hope the sisters understand that this is not my word; this is the word of the Bible. There are many examples of this in the Bible. In Numbers 1 the children of Israel were numbered, but the Bible does not say how many males and how many females there were; it gives only the number of males, not females (v. 2). In the Gospels the Lord Jesus fed the crowd with five loaves and two fish. The Bible says that there were about five thousand men, apart from women and children (Matt. 14:19-21; Mark 6:41-44). In God&rsquo;s household registration there are only men, not women, because on the wedding day the woman&rsquo;s head is covered when she is given to the man, and the man becomes her head. The most beautiful condition between a couple is the husband being the head and the wife submitting to the headship. Such a household is sweet and will last. Everything has its God-given position; this is not a matter of equality or inequality.</p>
<p>About twenty years ago I met an educated sister who was not convinced concerning this matter, even though she had read it in the Bible and heard messages related to it. She said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, does this saying in the Bible not value the male and belittle the female? Is this not gender inequality?&rdquo; I answered her with a smile, saying, &ldquo;The eyebrow is above the eye, and the eye is below the eyebrow. Would the eye say that the eyebrow is valued but the eye is belittled? Would moving the eye above the eyebrow be equality?&rdquo; She smiled when she heard this. I said, &ldquo;Sister, do not contend over this matter. The eye has its position, and the eyebrow has its position. The positions that God has arranged are beautiful. Would it look good for the eye to be moved above the eyebrow?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;This is an arrangement that we are accustomed to. Later we may discover that it looks better.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;The eye is below the eyebrow not only for good looks but for use. I know this because I sweat a lot. Without these two &lsquo;sweatwalls,&rsquo; I would not be able to open my eyes. Even if I sweat profusely, sweat will not get into my eyes. Even if I do not wipe away my sweat for two hours, sweat still will not enter my eyes. If we moved the eyes above the eyebrows, we would not be able to open our eyes when we sweat. Do you think being a woman is low? The man is often the &lsquo;sweatwall&rsquo; for the woman. The man has his position and function, and the woman has her position and function. When we keep our position, it is beautiful, good, restful, and secure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A woman who does not keep her position is dangerous. Man&rsquo;s fall was caused not by Adam but by Eve. She acted presumptuously and assumed the headship; thus, she made Adam fall and suffered loss herself. Man&rsquo;s fall was due not only to the serpent&rsquo;s temptation but also to the woman&rsquo;s assuming of the headship. The serpent was successful because Adam was not with Eve. Countless disasters in world history were brought about by women, because men were not around. The Lord has shown us how dangerous it is for women to assume the headship. We do not know where Adam went, but he was not with Eve. Had Eve known her position when the serpent spoke to her, she would have said, &ldquo;Hold on, let me get my husband.&rdquo; Eve did not fall when she ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; she fell when she assumed the headship. The serpent was aware that Eve would fall under his control as soon as she assumed the headship. It is a terrible and uncomely thing for a woman to assume the headship.</p>
<p>The sisters should not be angry about this, because even the brothers are women. Before God we all have the position of a woman. Thus, the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship has a symbolic meaning as well. Men are not the head; our head is Christ, God. It is dangerous for us to do something apart from Christ, apart from God. This is the principle of the woman&rsquo;s assuming the headship.</p>
<p>Eve was a woman; Adam was a man. Adam was the head; the woman was under the head. This is a symbol, a shadow, that shows the relationship between God and man. The unique Head in the universe is God, and we should be under His authority. Whenever we set God aside, set Christ aside, to deal with anything, we are setting our Adam, our Husband, aside and are assuming the headship. When Satan tempts us, he is afraid of our retreating into the Lord and letting the Lord assume the headship. This is the secret to overcoming. When we retreat and let God be our &ldquo;sweatwall,&rdquo; we overcome. We must remember that when we go beyond God, set God aside, and assume the headship, we have fallen into the hand of the evil one.</p>
<p>This is a great principle. The first fall of mankind involved man&rsquo;s assuming the headship and setting God aside. Contacting something outside of God is the greatest cause of man&rsquo;s failure. We must be watchful, because we are all women. We must not assume the headship in anything; instead, we must let God have the headship. When we retreat into God, we are preserved and we overcome. This is the secret to being preserved and overcoming.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
