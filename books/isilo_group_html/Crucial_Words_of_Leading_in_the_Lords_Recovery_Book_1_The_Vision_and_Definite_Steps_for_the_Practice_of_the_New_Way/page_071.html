<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING A SERVICE OF WARFARE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Num. 4:3; 26:2; Neh. 4:15-23; 1 Tim. 1:18; 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7; Eph. 6:13-14a</h1>
<p>During the past one and a half years we have been speaking concerning the building up of the small groups, the home meetings, the teaching of <em>Truth Lessons,</em> and the preaching of the gospel. In short, we have spoken about begetting, nourishing, and teaching. I am concerned that we have become indifferent to these matters because of the frequency of our speaking on them. We also may now consider our work to be very common and ordinary. Therefore, I received a burden from the Lord to remind all of us that our work is a spiritual warfare.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL LINE OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament, as far as God&rsquo;s economy is concerned, God&rsquo;s work was to build up the temple and the city. The entire Old Testament has the temple and the city as its center. God&rsquo;s work in the Old Testament age was carried out through different offices or ministries. There was the ministry of the priests, the ministry of the kings, and the ministry of the prophets. Although these three offices or ministries were different, their goal and center were the same&mdash;to build up God&rsquo;s temple and His kingdom, in other words, to build up God&rsquo;s house and His city. At the same time, the Old Testament clearly shows that the work of God&rsquo;s enemy was also focused on this line. He tried to frustrate, damage, and destroy God&rsquo;s building. This line can be clearly seen in the Old Testament.</p>
<p> The first time the church, which is the house of God, is spoken of in the New Testament is in Matthew 16:18. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&rdquo; This clearly shows that as soon as the church is mentioned, the gates of Hades, that is, the power of darkness, is also mentioned. This shows that in the New Testament, the work in God&rsquo;s economy to build up the church is a warfare.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR SPIRITUAL WARFARE<br />
FOR THE DIVINE BUILDING</h2>
<p>The problem with Christianity is that it is merely a religion. The people in Christianity see almost nothing concerning God&rsquo;s building. Therefore, they know nearly nothing about spiritual warfare. Thus, they cannot discern the enemy&rsquo;s tactics. They know that there is a devil, but at the most they only know that the devil tempts men to do evil things and causes them to turn away from God, to stumble, to sin, and to bring shame to God&rsquo;s name. They never touch the crucial facts, nor do they realize that Satan, the devil, with all his wiles and tactics, his temptations and corruptions, has only one goal in mind&mdash;to fight against God&rsquo;s building in order to frustrate, withstand, damage, and destroy it.</p>
<p>Today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should clearly see that we are not merely doing a work of recovery&mdash;recovering the truth, the gospel, the experience of Christ as life, and building up the church. We must see that all of this recovery work is related to God&rsquo;s building. God&rsquo;s building is at the center of His economy. His goal is to gain a house and a city, which are the church and the kingdom. Such a building work is altogether related to the enemy&rsquo;s final destiny. This, of course, stirs up his attack.</p>
<p>Before I saw the light concerning the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I heard many sermons, but I never heard any messages on spiritual warfare. John Bunyan was one of the most famous spiritual preachers among the Baptists in England in the seventeenth century. He wrote <em>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</em> and <em>The Holy War.</em> Sixty years ago, when I was still a young man, I read <em>The Holy War.</em> It speaks of man&rsquo;s warfare with Satan. The purpose of the book is to teach people how to oppose Satan when he attacks and how by faith they can withstand his temptations. However, this book does not speak of God&rsquo;s economy and His building. It says nothing of opposing and countering the power of darkness in the midst of building up God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>One day, God led me to see the light concerning His recovery. At that time, I was reading some English books as well as some books that had been translated by Brother Nee. Through these books I came to realize that, throughout the centuries, those who love the Lord with a pure heart and who know something about God&rsquo;s eternal purpose in their spirit experience a kind of spiritual warfare. They realize from the depth of their being that every step of God&rsquo;s recovery involves His enemy, and every step requires warfare. Yet very few have seen that there is the need of spiritual warfare in order to realize the divine building. Today we need to see that there is the need to engage ourselves in spiritual warfare for the building up of God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>During the past few days, because of a slight illness, I was forced to set aside my work temporarily and rest. During this time I reconsidered many things, especially the things we have seen and experienced in the past. I felt that I should pick up the burden to remind us of this matter. Perhaps we do not feel any attack and do not sense any warfare. However, we should realize that even this feeling is a result of Satan&rsquo;s intrusion. He has injected lethargy into us so that we will become numb to all feelings.</p>
<p>Nehemiah 4:23 says, &ldquo;Neither I nor my brothers nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each had his weapon at his right hand.&rdquo; I used to think that since the Bible is the canon of our faith, it should speak about divine and lofty matters. Why would the Bible record such a small thing as &ldquo;each had his weapon at his right hand&rdquo;? This word sounds too simple and shallow; it does not sound like the Scriptures. Yet we need to see that even this short word conveys much light of the truth. This short word shows the need for warfare! Nehemiah 4:23b in the American Standard Version says, &ldquo;Every one went with his weapon to the water.&rdquo; Even when they were going for water, the builders did not leave their weapons behind. This shows that there is warfare even in the smallest matters of our daily life.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_070.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_072.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 1: The Vision and Definite Steps for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 71</div><br></body></html>
