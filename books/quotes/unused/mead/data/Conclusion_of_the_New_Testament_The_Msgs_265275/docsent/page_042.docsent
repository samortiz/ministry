   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. For the Believers to Receive through Repentance for Forgiveness of Sins</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 47 says, "That repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse indicates that Christ as the One prophesied in the Old Testament is for the believers to receive through repentance for forgiveness of sins. b.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In His Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 46 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, "Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This indicates that it is in Christ's death and resurrection that we receive Him as the One prophesied in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Gospel of Luke does not seem to contain much theology.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, this book covers two mysterious items in theology Christ's birth, which involves the divine incarnation, and Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No one can explain fully the incarnation and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is God incarnated, and He is a man resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the incarnation and the resurrection are necessary for Christ to be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ is Christ because He is God incarnated and a man resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The conception and birth of Christ are a great mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible reveals that the very God in His reaching element, the Holy Spirit, came into a human virgin and was born in her and of her.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concerning this, the angel said to Mary, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore also the holy thing which is born will be called the Son of God" Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the conception was of the Holy Spirit, so what was born of that conception was a "holy thing," something intrinsically holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was Jesus our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Luke 1:35 seems to indicate that the Holy Spirit would be upon Mary only as the power for her to conceive the holy child.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, Matthew 1:18 and 20 tell us that Mary "was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit" and that "that which has been begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been begotten in Mary's womb before she delivered the child Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in the human virgin, accomplished with the divine and human essences, constituted a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature which produced a God-man, One who is both the complete God and the perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctly, without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the most wonderful and most excellent person of Jesus, who is Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The conception of the Savior was God's incarnation John 1:14 , constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence, thus producing the God-man of two natures divinity and humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 and might be a Man-Savior Luke 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition to the mystery of Christ's incarnation, Luke also speaks concerning Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is the incarnated One and He is the resurrected One.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As God He was incarnated to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a man He was put to death, and then He rose up from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Now He, the incarnated and resurrected One, is in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As the incarnated one, Christ brought God into man; as the resurrected One, He brought man into God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we receive Him as such a One, and we experience and enjoy the transaction whereby God comes into man and man is brought into God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ, the incarnated and resurrected One, is our Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For our experience and enjoyment, this Savior is revealed in the Gospel of Luke as the rising sun, the light, the glory, a moneylender, a Samaritan, a sheep-finder, the best robe, the fattened calf, the kingdom of God, and the One prophesied in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This wonderful One is everything in God's salvation.</S>
