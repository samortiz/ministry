   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BASE AND THE SHAFT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 31 speaks of the base and the shaft of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The base is for stability, and the shaft is for strength.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The four Gospels reveal that the Lord Jesus was always stable and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He always had a stable base, and no matter what situation He encountered, He stood as a strong shaft.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE CUPS WITH THE KNOBS</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AND BLOSSOMING BUDS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we come to an aspect of the lampstand which is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 31 says of the lampstand, Its cups, its knobs and its blossoming buds shall be from it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What are these cups, and why are they on the branches and the shaft?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The expression blossoming buds actually means blossoms, although blossoming buds is the literal translation of the Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the significance of these blossoms?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When I was young, I had great difficulty understanding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I thought that on each branch there was a knob over the cup and a blossom over the knob.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Actually, the cup, the knob, and the blossoming bud are all parts of one flower, one blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A flower, an almond flower for example, has several layers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The bottom layer may be green, like a green leaf.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The proper word to describe this bottom layer is calyx.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word knob in verse 31 denotes the calyx of a flower, the outer leafy green layer of a flower.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The calyx contains the blossoming bud.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The top of the flower, the blossoming bud, is actually the flower itself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 31 the word cup is used to describe the whole flower, including the calyx and the blossoming bud.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the cup is equal to the complete flower.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This cup comprises the calyx at the bottom and the buds at the top.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the buds blossom, a flower is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the lampstand the cup is shaped like an almond blossom, an almond flower.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here the almond flower is called a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Almonds blossom early in the spring, before other trees.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every little almond flower is a cup.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the bottom of the cup there is a leafy green part called the calyx, which forms a container to hold the blossoming buds.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually these buds become flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A. The Cups Shaped like Almond Blossoms</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The cups shaped like almond blossoms signify the resurrection life blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Numbers 17:8, Aaron s rod budded and brought forth almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a picture of resurrection life coming out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Aaron s rod was a dead stick, but through resurrection it brought forth almonds.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, almond blossoms signify the blossoming of resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have pointed out that an almond tree blossoms early in the spring.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, the almond blossom signifies the firstfruit of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jeremiah 1:11 and 12 say, Moreover the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then said the Lord unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Hebrew the words almond and hasten are from the same root.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This root word means to watch over, to be alert.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The spiritual significance of this is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Resurrection implies to watch, to be alert, to hasten.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Resurrection hastens matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Jeremiah 1:12, the Lord s intention was to hasten His word to perform it; that is, He would hasten to fulfill His word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have pointed out that Christ s being the light of life is altogether a matter of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now we see that it is also a matter wholly in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Without resurrection life, there cannot be any light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Christ can be the light of life only in His divinity and in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, divinity and resurrection are the prerequisites for Christ to be the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In principle, the same is true of us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot shine by our natural life, by our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we would shine forth the light of life, we must have divinity and we must be in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Resurrection is the basis for the shining of the divine light.</S>
