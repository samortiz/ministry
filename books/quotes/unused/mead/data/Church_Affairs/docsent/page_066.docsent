   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Sending Financial Help</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Other Local Churches for Their Use</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In addition, a local church can also send money to other local churches for their use.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many local churches may have difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sometimes there are particular hardships, as in the case of Antioch sending money to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the brothers in Jerusalem had difficulties, the brothers in Antioch sent money to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is also something that a local church should do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may hear of special circumstances in a church in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a consequence, we should send them money.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The mutual supply among the churches is an important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Remember that in the beginning in Jerusalem, many brothers and sisters sold their lands and houses.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the time of famine, Antioch sent money through the hand of Barnabas and Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am glad that the elders in Antioch did not ask, We wonder whether they have spent all that money.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do the apostles still have anything left over from that sale?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was not something the other churches did.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What was done in Acts was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Antioch rose up and sent brothers to take money to Jerusalem to supply the need in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was at this time that Barnabas came from Jerusalem to Antioch for the purpose of helping Antioch, and Antioch asked Barnabas to take the money and go and help Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a very pleasant thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Giving to Individual Workers</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When a local church receives income, there should be money given to individual workers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is what Philippi did with Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When Paul was working in the region of Macedonia and in Thessalonica, the church in Philippi once and again sent money for his use.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we read the book of Philippians, we know that when Paul was in Macedonia and Thessalonica, all of his money came from Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Otherwise, the work could not have gone on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we need to help the brothers everywhere to see and help them to learn to give money to the brothers who are workers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The church in Corinth was a declining church; its spiritual condition before God was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With respect to the supplying of Paul, they only criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nothing was given.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They gave Paul nothing except criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, I think that the churches in various localities should pay attention to how to give money to those who serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The churches should pay attention to the aspect of giving to individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Giving to the Work in the Region</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I want the brothers and sisters to pay attention to yet another need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The money from all the local churches should be sent not only to the individual workers, but also to the work in the entire region.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our view is not mistaken, the exhortation that Paul gave to the Corinthians was that he expected them to prepare the money to be sent to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time there was not just one church that sent money to Jerusalem; the churches in Galatia sent money as well.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Galatia is a province, and there were many churches there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul exhorted the church in Corinth to gather their money and send it quickly to Jerusalem, just as the churches in Galatia had done.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time not only was Jerusalem in famine, but Judea was as well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the money sent to Jerusalem was given not only for the local church in Jerusalem, but also for Judea, the entire region represented by Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The money was sent to Jerusalem so that Jerusalem could send it to all of Judea.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a principle here.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Money can be given to a local church for their use.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For example, if Foochow is in difficulty, we can give money to the local church in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Wenchow has problems, we can send money to the local church in Wenchow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, if that region has difficulties, then the money would not be given to the one locality of Foochow, but Foochow should be asked to make arrangements for distribution to the brothers and sisters in the entire region.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, we should show the churches that with respect to the work among the churches, there is this matter of region.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a church in a region is having difficulties, the brothers should learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even during normal times when the churches are not in difficulty and there are many co-workers in a region, everyone should learn before God to pay attention to the need of all of the co-workers in the region.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The local churches need to learn to send the money to the co-workers in the region so that they can distribute it among the co-workers in that region.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I do not know if you are clear that these are things that a local church should do concerning money.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What they have received, they need to use for local expenses, for needy brothers, for the responsible brothers, for brothers in the work in other cities, for the needs of other churches, and for the region.</S>
