   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-THREE THE BREAKING DOWN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE MIDDLE WALL OF PARTITION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the matter of the breaking down of the middle wall of partition 2:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. CHRIST BEING OUR PEACE</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaking of Christ, 2:14 says, He Himself is our peace.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word our refers to both Jewish and Gentile believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through the blood of Christ we have been brought near both to God and to God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ, who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers, is Himself our peace, our harmony, in that He made both one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Due to the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through Christ s redemption, this separation has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now the two are one in the redeeming Christ, who is the bond of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At present, there is still a separation between Israel and the rest of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But according to God s economy, this separation has already been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the eyes of God, it was taken away by the redemption of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now the Christ who has removed this separation is the bond of peace between Israel and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CHRIST HAVING BROKEN DOWN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MIDDLE WALL OF PARTITION A. The Middle Wall of Partition</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being the Law of the Commandments</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>in Ordinances</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 14 speaks of the middle wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This middle wall of partition is the law of the commandments in ordinances v. 15 , which was given because of man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The first of these ordinances was circumcision to cut off man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Circumcision became the middle wall of partition because it made the main distinction between the Jews, the circumcision, and the Gentiles, the uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, the middle wall of partition, this distinction, became the enmity between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the law of Moses there were two kinds of commandments: moral commandments, such as the commandments concerning stealing and the honoring of parents, and ritual commandments, such as the commandment concerning the keeping of the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The commandments regarding circumcision and the eating regulations were ritual commandments, not moral commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Leviticus 11 there are a number of commandments dealing with eating.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These commandments surely have nothing to do with morality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person s morality is not affected by whether or not he eats something that is regarded as unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The three main ordinances in Judaism were circumcision, the keeping of the Sabbath, and the dietary regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every Israelite male had to be circumcised on the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, the Jews were required to keep the Sabbath and to observe numerous regulations concerning their diet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These ordinances were the three main columns supporting Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He broke down the column of Sabbath keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During the years of His ministry, He purposely broke the Sabbath by healing people on the Sabbath day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Jews were very much offended by this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then Peter took the lead to break the dietary regulations, although he did it in a rather weak way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because he received the vision in Acts 10, Peter was forced to give up these regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, in Galatians 2, Peter withdrew from eating with the Gentiles when certain men came down from Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, through the breaking of the dietary regulations, another supporting column of Judaism was brought down.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Apostle Paul broke down the column of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Philippians 3 he even used a new derogatory term, the concision, to replace the honorable term, circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, he referred to those of the circumcision as dogs and told the Philippians to beware of dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No wonder the Jews tried to kill him!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a sense he was even worse in their eyes than Jesus, for circumcision was the leading ordinance in Judaism; it meant more to them than the Sabbath or the dietary regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, through the work of the Apostle Paul, the remaining structure of Judaism collapsed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We need to keep in mind the difference between moral laws and ritual laws.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The moral laws will never be abolished, not in this age nor in the millennium nor in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The ritual commandments, on the contrary, are not permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether a person is allowed to eat pork or is required to keep the Sabbath or practice circumcision depends upon the age in which he lives.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Any Jewish male born after Abraham and before John the Baptist was obligated to practice circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Likewise, the commandments regarding the Sabbath and diet were in force during a particular time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By the middle wall of partition Paul meant the law of commandments in ordinances, the ritual commandments related to circumcision, the Sabbath, and diet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The law of ritual commandments was a middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>As we shall see, any ordinance or ritual is a middle wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The ritual commandments were given firstly because of man s flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Circumcision, for example, was required because man had become fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, God commanded man to cut off the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The ritual commandments concerning diet were given so that God s chosen people would be careful to keep themselves clean.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Animals that did not have cloven hoofs and that did not chew the cud were unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The cloven hoof symbolizes discernment in walking; it indicates that we should not walk in any place that is defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God s people need to have a keen discernment in their daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, they need to learn to chew the cud by taking in God s word and considering it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because fallen people do not have the necessary discernment and do not consider God s word, these commandments were given to God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, these ordinances became the middle wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Moreover, this distinction and separation became the cause of enmity between the circumcision, the Jews, and the uncircumcision, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every ordinance creates enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In 1963 I was invited to speak at a meeting in Tyler, Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>During the meeting, I began to say Amen in a very quiet way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Immediately someone warned me that the people in this country could not tolerate this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After that warning, I did not dare to utter Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If I insisted on doing so, a partition would have been erected, and enmity would have been created.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is even possible for the practice of pray-reading to become a middle wall of partition and a source of enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although you may find pray-reading very helpful, you should not insist on it if others do not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>To do so is to cause separation and to create enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We must be careful not to bring any ordinances into the church life, for all ordinances kill.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Some may prefer shouting in the meetings, and others may prefer silence.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is possible to make ordinances about either shouting or being silent.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>These ordinances cause not only division but enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I have witnessed the enmity created by such ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In 1963 I went with some other brothers to visit a certain group in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the meeting I simply did whatever the others did.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Afterward a brother asked me how I could do this.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I replied, What was wrong with that practice?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Was it sinful?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Why would you not do it?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Why do you insist upon being different from the other saints?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I did not personally care for some of the practices in that meeting, but I participated in them nonetheless in order to remove the middle wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>I had a similar experience in Manchuria in 1933.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>During my visit there, I was a guest one day in the home of some Japanese Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Like many young Chinese, I had been taught to dislike the Japanese because of the unfriendly political relationship between China and Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, when I entered this home, I took off my shoes and sat on the tatami, just as everyone else did.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Surely there is nothing wrong with sitting on a tatami instead of on a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We cannot say that the one is right and that the other is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The same is true with shouting in the meetings or with being silent.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>In the Bible there are verses that give place for both.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Although we may like certain practices, we should not insist on them.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we insist on a particular practice, we make it an ordinance that separates and creates enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Christians have been divided by ordinances, such as the various ordinances concerning baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Some insist upon baptizing backwards; others insist on doing it forwards.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Some Christians are divided over the use of musical instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Some permit a piano, but not an organ; the practice of others, however, is the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>As soon as we have ordinances, division comes immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Although I appreciate shouting and loud praises in the meetings, I am not for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>To insist on any practice is to cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Hence, we must not have any ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>On the cross of Christ all ordinances were abolished.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Because ordinances create enmity and division, we must deal with them very seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It is possible for ordinances to become a cause of hatred even among those who have been close to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Two brothers may have enjoyed pleasant fellowship for a number of years, but simply because one is for shouting and the other is for being silent, there may be enmity between them.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Instead of loving each other, they may come to hate each other.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Religious jealousy is a terrible thing.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>History tells us that many have been slain because of it through the subtlety of Satan, the murderer.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Therefore, we must repudiate all ordinances and go along with the practices of the saints, as long as these practices do not involve anything sinful, immoral, or idolatrous.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Although we may not approve of certain practices, we should go along with them in order to give no ground for ordinances.</S>
