   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>BY LIVING TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Second Corinthians 5:14-15 says, The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here Paul does not speak of living for the Lord, by the Lord, or with the Lord; instead, he speaks of living to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To live to Christ is to take Him as the aim of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In everything we do at home, at work, or in the church life Christ should be our unique aim.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Galatians 2:19 says, I through law have died to law that I might live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To live to law means that we are under the law, led by the law, ruled by the law, and obligated to follow the law.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To live to God or to the Lord means that we are under the leading and constraint of the Lord to fulfill His demand and to satisfy and accomplish His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The entire text of 2 Corinthians 4 and 5 shows that to live to the Lord means to live the kind of life that the Lord Jesus lived.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter 4 we see that the apostle experienced the putting to death of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we experience the putting to death of Jesus, we can live the kind of life Jesus lived.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, to live to the Lord is to live a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a living always puts the outer man to death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus lived this kind of life, and those who live such a life today are living to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we would live to the Lord, we must deny our outer man, that is, our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we live to Christ, we do not live by our outer man, by our flesh; rather, we live by the inner man, by our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord does not want us to be so active for Him; rather, He wants us to experience the putting to death of Jesus so that our natural man and our active being may be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must understand the difference between living for Christ and living to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To Christ implies that we are the Lord s possession, that we already belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For Christ implies that we are still our own and are according to our pleasure and convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may be active and aggressive for the Lord in a natural way, doing things for the Lord by our natural aggressiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This offends the Lord, and it distracts us from enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since we belong to the Lord, the Lord desires that we be to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not enough to say that we are for Him; saying that we are for Him indicates that we still have things under our control and that we could leave Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if we are to the Lord, we cannot leave Him and are even one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Living to the Lord is based upon the fact that we are the Lord s Rom 14:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We live to Him because we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must realize that the Lord bought us with the great price of His precious blood 1 Cor 6:19-20; 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now He is our Lord and Master, and we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All that we have, all that we do, and all that we are is unto Him; everything is wholly unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not say that we are doing certain things for Him, because we already belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since every believer has been bought by the Lord with a great price, he should have one living to the Lord.</S>
