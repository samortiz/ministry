   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From these five major religions we see that in the universe there is only one God and only one Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the Koran of the Islamic religion came from copying the Bible, it is of the same one source.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This source is what the Bible calls the unique true God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Much of the human race uses this Bible, and almost all people use the calendar of this God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, the building up and the development of Christianity and Islam, were derived from this God and this Bible; that is, they were derived from God and the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All intellectuals acknowledge that human society is a mystery, that the universe is also a mystery, and that in this mystery there is a center of reality, which is God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The expression of this God is the word; all the elements of this God are in His word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Where there is God, there is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where there is no God, there is no word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is the same with us human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Where there is man, there is the word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Man not only speaks, but he speaks daily.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because man has the innate ability to speak, he does not feel that to speak is precious or marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the fact that man is able to speak is an amazing thing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Animals such as cows, horses, and dogs cannot talk; they can only make sounds but no words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, man's ability to speak is a marvelous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>MAN HAVING A SPIRIT AND THE ABILITY TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When God created man, the most marvelous thing was that He created a spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of all the millions of things God created, man alone has a spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Chinese frequently use the word ling spirit , which has many denotations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A person who is quick-minded is described as ling-huo, "spirit-living"; a medicine that is very effective is called wan-ling-tan, an "all-spirit-pill."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Chinese culture the spirit is a special thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ancient Chinese sages did not teach religion, nor did they teach the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Neither did they teach people that there is a spirit in man that is a vessel to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, they found out that in man there is something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, the Chinese say that man is the spirit of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God's creation of man, the second marvelous thing was that man was given the ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Speech does not involve only the use of the vocal cords, but it also involves the hearing of the ear and the conveying and understanding of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, speech is a great, wide field of learning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the earth is filled with all kinds of human languages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to some studies, the best languages are Chinese, English, Greek, and Hebrew; the latter two were used by God in revealing His word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, in rhythm and rhyme, Greek is inferior to Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As to English, a large portion of the language follows the Greek language.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE SPEAKING OF MAN BEING A MANIFESTATION OF HIS LIKENESS TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All men possess two marvelous things: one is the spirit and the other is the ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Human living is altogether a story of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The thing we do the most in our daily life is speak.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if we do not do anything the whole day, we are still full of words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose our ability to speak is taken away from us so that neither you nor I can speak, and neither the old nor the young can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If such a group of people came together, it would be hard for them to accomplish anything.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, speaking is truly a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We were born into a realm of speaking, we live in a realm of speaking, and we are accustomed to being in a realm of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We spend our whole life in this realm, yet we do not quite realize the importance of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Speaking is a crucial matter; only God Himself can give us the ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God is a speaking God, and in creating man as a vessel to contain Him and be useful to Him, He created man exactly the same as He, even to the extent that man speaks as God speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, man's ability to speak is a manifestation of man's likeness to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible says that God created man in His image, and the most important aspect of God's image is that God speaks; thus, man also speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This matter of speaking is most frequently seen in a family.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who are married all know that in a typical family the wife speaks more than the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The husband usually sits and observes, but the wife unceasingly takes care of various matters and gives orders, so naturally she speaks more.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, if the wife does not say a word the whole day, then it will be hard for the husband and the wife to live together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the present age everyone has to learn to speak, and the more one speaks, the better he can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Chinese say, "What is truly within will be manifested without."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that if a person desires to speak weightily and properly, he must read many classic books and be fully educated.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the words he utters can be accepted and admired by others.</S>
