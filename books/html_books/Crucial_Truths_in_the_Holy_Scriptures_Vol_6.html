 <h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
 <p><em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</em> was originally published in Chinese as a six-volume set containing sixty topics of basic truths in the Bible. The topics and verses were selected and arranged by Witness Lee, and these books were greatly used by the Lord in the early spread of the local churches throughout the Far East. Volume 6 contains topics 51 through 60. These messages have been translated from the Chinese.</p>
 <h1 class="title">PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION</h1> 
 <p>In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God.</p>
 <p>These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo. Later, in the autumn of 1949, Brother Lee studied them again with the brothers and sisters in Taipei and added eighteen topics for a total of sixty topics in all. Chapters 1 through 16 cover the condition of a sinner to the time of knowing his salvation. Chapters 17 through 60 examine various matters a believer should know and pursue after his salvation, with chapters 17 through 26 specifically covering ten matters a believer should practice after his salvation.</p>
 <p>The purpose of these crucial truths is to make the matters of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation clear to those who lack an understanding of their salvation. Furthermore, they lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation. The purpose is specific, but the messages are diverse.</p>
 <p>The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God. We look to the Lord to inspire every brother and sister to read and study these notes carefully. We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible.</p>

</ol>
<p>The church is a very important subject in the New Testament. The church is a central topic from Matthew to Revelation. If we read the New Testament carefully, we will see that an important goal of the Holy Spirit, who inspired the writers of the New Testament, is to reveal the church. Therefore, we must study the New Testament in order to see the church. We will briefly look at twenty-two major points and ten golden principles concerning the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN FOR THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The church, according to the eternal purpose which He made&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:10-11).</p>
<p>Ephesians specifically speaks of God&rsquo;s plan and heart&rsquo;s desire for the church in eternity past. God planned the church before the foundation of the world in eternity past. Before anything was created, before the beginning of time, God planned to have the church. Therefore, the church is according to His eternal purpose.</p>
<p>Any plan that a person makes comes out of his heart&rsquo;s desire. This is true of God&rsquo;s plan for the church. According to the Bible, the church is something that God desires. This desire did not arise after the creation of the world in time; it was always present in eternity. Thus, God planned to have the church according to His eternal heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>According to our understanding, we regard the church as something in this age. Many think that the church came into being when sinners became Christians; thus, the church is also regarded as something related to our needs. These concepts are very shortsighted and not according to God&rsquo;s revelation concerning the church. In God&rsquo;s New Testament revelation, He clearly and definitely shows that the church comes out of His eternal heart&rsquo;s desire and that the church exists because of His eternal desire and plan. The church is not an idea or arrangement made by God after the creation of the world, nor does it exist because of man&rsquo;s need. The church is not temporal, temporary, or accidental. It did not happen by chance. The church exists because of God&rsquo;s deep, eternal, and holy plan according to His deep, eternal, and holy desire. Therefore, we should not look at the church from our perspective based on our feelings. In order to properly see the church, we must see it from the perspective of God&rsquo;s eternal desire and according to His eternal plan</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AS GOD&rsquo;S HIDDEN MYSTERY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The economy of the mystery...which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things,...the church&rdquo;; &ldquo;The mystery of Christ, which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:9-10, 4-5).</p>
<p>In eternity past God planned the church according to His heart&rsquo;s desire, and in time He created all things to accomplish His plan for the church. Although He wanted to gain the church to satisfy His heart&rsquo;s desire, He did not tell anyone or any creature about His purpose. His plan was a mystery hidden in Him. Only He knew that the purpose of creation was to gain the church. He did not reveal the church to anyone in the Old Testament. He did not tell any of the patriarchs who feared Him or any of the prophets who spoke for Him. The church was not spoken of specifically in the entire revelation of the Old Testament. Thus, the church was a mystery hidden throughout the ages until the time of the New Testament when it was revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The secrets that a person hides in his heart and does not tell others are often quite precious and important. This is how God views the church. The church is a very important matter that God treasures in His heart. Therefore, He was unwilling to speak of this great matter until the time was full. Instead, He kept it hidden in Himself as a hidden mystery. This is the reason that people throughout the ages have been perplexed concerning the meaning of the universe and the things in it. Not only did those who were far from God in the age of the Old Testament not know the meaning of the universe but even the patriarchs who walked with God as His friends and the prophets who spoke His words did not know. Even today in the age of the New Testament, many are ignorant of this matter. Today many people still regard the universe as a mystery, and even many believers do not truly understand the meaning of the universe. With the exception of a few believers who have received revelation from God, human beings do not know that the universe exists for the sake of the church. In the age of the church, the church is still hidden to most people, including most believers. Despite the fact that God has made known the mystery, many have not seen the revelation of this mystery. The church is hidden to them. If we want to know the church today, we need God&rsquo;s subjective revelation, because we cannot know the church, which is a great mystery in God, without revelation from God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S LOVING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:25).</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that the Lord loves the church. The Lord&rsquo;s love for the church is compared to a husband&rsquo;s love for his wife. This is a sweet and tender love. Because the Lord loves the church, He was willing to sacrifice Himself and give Himself up for the church so that He might gain the church as His beloved spouse. His love for the church was His motivation for going to the cross and giving Himself up for her. The emphasis in this verse is not on redemption but on the producing of the church. He gave Himself up for the church because of His love for the church and for the purpose of producing the church.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Finding one pearl of great value, he went and sold all that he had and bought it&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 13:46).</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes the church is like a pearl of great value. In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes the church is not only a pearl but also a pearl of great value. The Lord went to the cross and gave all He had to purchase this pearl of great value because of His love for the church. The Bible says that this pearl was &ldquo;bought with a price&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:20). The price that He paid was His precious blood (1 Pet. 1:18-19). The church is a pearl that He bought with a great price, His own blood (Acts 20:28). From the great price that He paid, we can see how highly the Lord values the church and how much He treasures her.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;But nourishes and cherishes it, even as Christ also the church&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:29).</p>
<p>Because Christ loves the church, He not only gave Himself up to produce her and gave His all to obtain her, He is now nourishing and cherishing the church. Nourishing is related to His feeding, and cherishing is related to His caring. Christ continuously nourishes and cherishes the church because He loves the church. For the past two thousand years, He has been nourishing and cherishing the church, just as a person nourishes and cherishes his own body. Christ not only loves the church as His wife but also nourishes and cherishes her as His own Body, as a part of Himself. These verses speak of the great love that Christ has for the church. The church is the object of His heart&rsquo;s desire and the apple of His eye.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place. And Jehovah God built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman and brought her to the man&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 2:21-22).</p>
<p>Ephesians 5 shows that Eve being produced from Adam is a type of the church being produced from Christ. Adam is a type of Christ, and Eve is a type of the church. Just as it was not good for Adam to be alone, it is not good for Christ to be without the church. Just as Adam could not find a counterpart from among all the birds, beasts, and animals, Christ could not find a counterpart among all creation. Just as God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and took one of his ribs to build Eve as his counterpart, God caused Christ to die and pierced His side to release His resurrection life to build the church as His counterpart (John 19:34). Just as Eve was presented to Adam when he awoke from his sleep, the church was presented to Christ when He resurrected from the dead (1 Pet. 1:3). Just as Adam considered Eve to be bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, being a part of himself and being joined to her as one flesh, Christ considers the church as bone of His bones and flesh of His flesh, being a part of Himself and being joined to her as one Body. The church is produced through Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection, which released His resurrection life. The church comes out from Christ as a part of Christ so that she can match Him and be one with Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. A &ldquo;pearl&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 13:46).</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes the church is a pearl. Pearls are produced when an oyster is wounded by sand in the sea. The church was produced when Christ was wounded by sinners in the world. Thus, the church was produced by Christ being wounded and by Christ releasing His resurrection life through His resurrection from the dead. Following His death and resurrection, the Holy Spirit brings people to touch the death wounds Christ received on the cross and then imparts Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life so that they will be regenerated to become the pearl, the church, that Christ treasures and loves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will build My church&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:18).</p>
<p>The first time that the Lord referred directly to the church is in Matthew 16:18. Although this is the beginning of His speaking concerning the church, it is not the beginning of the church. In verse 18 the Lord said that He would build His church, not that He had started to build it. Thus, He was prophesying concerning the future building of the church.</p>
<p>In Matthew 18:17 the Lord spoke of the church for the second and last time in the Gospels. His word shows that the prophecy concerning the church in chapter 16 would shortly become a reality, because He told the disciples that they would be able to bring matters to the church.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord added together day by day those who were being saved&rdquo;; &ldquo;Great fear came upon the whole church&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:47; 5:11).</p>
<p>These verses refer to the time of Pentecost. When Pentecost came, the Holy Spirit descended and the church was established. Then the Lord added together day by day those who were being saved. The Holy Spirit later called all those who believed in the Lord and were saved &ldquo;the whole church&rdquo; in a collective sense (v. 11). This proves that the church began when the Holy Spirit descended at Pentecost.</p>
<p>Even though Christ was on the earth, He had to pass through death, resurrection, and ascension, and then descend as the Spirit in order to produce the church. Without Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, there could be no church. Without His death on the cross, there could be no church. And without the descension of the Holy Spirit, there could be no church. The church was produced in reality by Christ&rsquo;s passing through death and resurrection to become the Spirit, and the church began in practicality when the Spirit descended on Pentecost. Today the principle is still the same; that is, the reality and practicality of the church depend upon Christ, the cross, and the Spirit. These three elements are essential to the existence of the church. If we want to know the church, we must know Christ, the cross, and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ESTABLISHING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will build&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:18).</p>
<p>This verse shows that the church is established by the Lord Himself. On the surface it appears as if the believers establish the church, but actually the Lord is building the church in and through the believers. The church is built and established by the Lord as the Spirit moves in people. If the Lord does not move within believers to cause them to build, whatever comes out of their work will not be the church.</p>
<p>The Lord spoke of the church in Matthew 16 and showed that the church is not only out of Him and built upon Him but also built and established by Him. He is the source and foundation of the church. He is also the Builder of the church. The church is built by Himself upon Himself. Man cannot build the church. Anything man can build is not the church. Man can build a house, and man can establish a club, but man cannot build and establish the church. Only Christ is the source and foundation of the church, and only Christ can build and establish the church. Christ must initiate and move within man to cause him to build and establish the church. In the matter of building and establishing the church, man can only &ldquo;second&rdquo; the Lord&rsquo;s motion, agree with the Lord, and follow the Lord. Man cannot initiate or take the lead in building. Initiating something and taking the lead are matters for the Head, Christ. He is the Director of the building; we are only His servants and co-laborers.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord added together day by day those who were being saved&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:47).</p>
<p>The church is built with those who are saved, but the One who adds those who are being saved to the church is the Lord, not man. Outwardly, it appears as if we are testifying for the Lord and preaching the gospel to cause people to be saved, but the actual work of salvation can be done only by the Lord Jesus through the Holy Spirit. Only the Lord Himself can save people. Therefore, He is the One who adds those who are being saved to the church. He builds the church with those He saves.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;God has blended&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:24).</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:12-13 speaks of the church as the one Body, and verses 14 through 23 illustrate this in the context of the human body. Then verse 24 speaks of God blending the body. Just as our bodies have been blended by God, so also the church, the Body, has been blended by God. Today a person can build a machine, but no one can build a human body. Similarly, no one can build the church, the Body. This work belongs to God exclusively; no one can take His place. The most that we can build is a community, not the church. Only God can produce the church, and only God can blend the church together.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s building&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 3:9; see also Eph. 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s building of the church is God&rsquo;s building of the church. The church is a living house built with living stones, just as a body is a living organism composed of living members. No man can do this building work. Even the apostles were merely workers used by God. The building of the church is accomplished by God in Christ through the Holy Spirit. The Triune God alone is the Builder of the church. The church is built and established by Him. If we would know the church, we must know that only God can build and establish it. With respect to this matter, we must be dealt with and give God His full rightful position.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ESSENCE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Body of Christ<br />
Emphasizing the Universal Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The church, which is His Body&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:22-23; see also Col. 1:24).</p>
<p>The church is not a chapel, a meeting place, or any kind of building. The church is not a mission board or a gospel organization. The church is the Body of Christ. A body is a living organism. Therefore, the church is not a dead, physical building or a dead, formal organization. It is a living organism with life, just as our body is a living organism. Just as our body cannot be separated from us, the church as the Body of Christ cannot be separated from Christ. Our life is in our body, and our body is our expression. In the same way, Christ&rsquo;s life is in His Body, the church, and the church is His expression.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He is the Head of the Body, the church&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:18; see also Eph. 5:23).</p>
<p>The church is Christ&rsquo;s Body, and Christ is the church&rsquo;s Head. Therefore, Christ and the church are one Body. They are a mysterious, great, universal Body with one life and one nature. Christ is seated in the heavenlies (1:20-21), and the church is also seated with Him in the heavenlies (2:6). Christ received all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18), and the church shares in His authority (Luke 10:19). Now the life of the church is hidden with Christ in God, but in the future the church will be manifested with Christ in glory (Col. 3:3-4). All that Christ has obtained and attained is available to the church. Christ is the life and content of the church, and the church is Christ&rsquo;s organism and expression. The church receives everything from Christ, and Christ expresses everything through the church. The two are joined and blended together, abiding in and with each other. Just as the head uses the body to do all things, accomplish all things, and manifest all things, Christ uses the church to do all things, accomplish all things, and manifest all things. This is the reason that the Bible identifies the church, as the Body of Christ, with the Christ (1 Cor. 12:12).</p>
<p>When the Bible speaks of Christ, sometimes it refers to Christ Himself and sometimes to Christ and the church. The Bible joins Christ and the church together and speaks of them as one great mystery. Christ is the Head of the mysterious Christ, and the church is the Body of the mysterious Christ. Together the two are a great mysterious Body, the universal Christ. This great, mysterious, universal Christ is comprised of Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. All believers throughout the ages are the Body of the great mysterious, universal Christ. We must know the church as the mysterious Body of the mysterious Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Now you are the Body of Christ, and members individually&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:27; see also Rom. 12:4-5; Eph. 4:11-16; 5:30; Col. 2:19).</p>
<p>The church as the mysterious Body of Christ is composed of all the saved ones who have the life of Christ and who are thus joined together in the life of Christ. All the saved ones who have the life of Christ are members of Christ&rsquo;s mysterious Body. With respect to us as individuals, we are members, but we are members one of another; with respect to us corporately, we are the Body of Christ. As saved ones, we are members of the mysterious Body of Christ who corporately constitute this mysterious Body. Every saved one is a part of the Body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The House of God Emphasizing the Local Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The house of God, which is the church of the living God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 3:15).</p>
<p>In one aspect, the church is the Body of Christ, and in another aspect, it is also the house of God. With respect to Christ, the church is a body; with respect to God, the church is a house. A body is the manifestation of a person, whereas a house is the dwelling place of a person. On the one hand, the church is the Body of Christ as His expression, and on the other hand, the church is the house of God as His dwelling place. The former expresses the fact that the church is one with Christ, having Christ&rsquo;s life and nature; the latter expresses the fact that the church is one with God, having God&rsquo;s life and nature. The life and nature of Christ are the same as the life and nature of God but are seen from a different perspective.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You are...members of the household of God...a dwelling place of God in spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:19, 22; see also 1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>Since the church is the house of God, those in the church are members of the household of God and are the dwelling place of God in spirit. The members of a man&rsquo;s family are born of him and out of him. They have his life and nature, and they are part of his house. Similarly, the members of the household of God are born of Him and out of Him. They have His life and nature, and they are part of His house. Since the church is born of God and out of God, having His life and nature, the church is the household of God, the dwelling place of God in spirit.</p>
<p>The word <em>house</em> in both English and Greek has two meanings. One meaning is that of a household, and the other is that of a dwelling place. The church as the house of God reflects these two meanings. On the one hand, the church is the household of God, and on the other hand, the church is the dwelling place of God. When the word <em>house</em> refers to a household in common usage, it does not include the dwelling place itself. With regard to its usage in relation to the church as the house of God, however, <em>house</em> refers to both a household and a dwelling place. The church, which is composed of the members of God&rsquo;s household, is the dwelling place of God. Believers are the dwelling place, the building, and the house. All believers are living stones. Living things can grow, but dead things cannot. Every believer has the life of God. We are living, not dead. Therefore, we can grow to become a living building, a living house, as God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;My brothers; in the midst of the church&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:12).</p>
<p>Just as Christ&rsquo;s Body is composed of all those with the life of Christ, God&rsquo;s house is composed of all those with the life of God. Those with the life of Christ are those with God&rsquo;s life. They are members of the Body of Christ, members one of another, and brothers in the house of God, brothers one of another. They are members of the Body of Christ because they have the life of Christ and are out of Christ. They are brothers in the house of God because they have the life of God and are born of God. All those with the life of God are part of the house of God. Individually, they are brothers; corporately, they are the house of God. Together they are God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Thus, the Bible shows that the church is the Body of Christ and the house of God. The church is the Body, and the church is the house. The church is the Body with respect to Christ and the house with respect to God. The emphasis of the Body is universal, while the emphasis of the house is local. In the entire universe, the church is the Body of Christ, the expression of Christ. In the different localities, the church is the house of God, the dwelling place of God. Of course, in all the localities, the churches are miniature expressions of the Body of Christ, and in the entire universe, the church is completely the house of God, a complete dwelling place. However, the emphasis of the Body of Christ is on the universal aspect of the church, and the emphasis of the house of God is on the local aspect of the church. When we refer to the universal church, we refer mainly to the Body of Christ, and when we refer to the local church, we refer mainly to the house of God. The Body of Christ is a living organism, and the house of God is a living constitution.</p>
<p>Both the Body of Christ and the house of God speak of God coming to live within man, becoming one with man, and mingling with man to form a mysterious union of God and man. Therefore, in 1 Timothy 3:15-16 Paul says, &ldquo;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; The apostle&rsquo;s word here means that the church as the house of God is the dwelling place of the living God. The living God dwells in the church, and the church expresses all that He is. Thus, the church is the pillar and base of the truth concerning what God is. The church is the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth of what God is. All that God is, is in the church, and all that God is, is expressed through the church. Therefore, the church is the great mystery of godliness, an expression of God Himself, manifesting the great mystery of God. This great mystery is God manifested in the flesh; it is God dwelling in redeemed men of flesh and corporately expressing Himself out from them. The true meaning of the church involves the mingling of God and man, the union of God and man, which is a great mystery through which God is expressed in man (Eph. 5:32).</p>
<p>The church is the enlargement of Christ, the magnification of Christ. Christ is the mingling of God and man, and the principle of Christ is God manifested in the flesh, that is, God mingled with man, divinity mingled with humanity to be manifested in and expressed through humanity. The church is the enlargement of this principle. She is the enlargement of the manifestation of God in the flesh, the enlargement of the mingling of God and man. She is the enlargement of divinity mingled with humanity to be manifested in and expressed through humanity. Christ is God manifested in the flesh and mingled with a man, a Nazarene; the church is God manifested in millions of redeemed men and mingled with them. Therefore, the church is the enlargement of Christ from the individual Christ to the corporate Christ. The individual Christ involves the mystery of godliness, and the corporate Christ, the church, involves the great mystery of godliness. The individual Christ was born in Bethlehem, and the corporate Christ was produced on the day of Pentecost. Pentecost was the enlargement of Bethlehem in that the living God was mingled with thousands of redeemed people in the flesh and then manifested in these believers. This is the church.</p>
<p>Thus, the church is the mingling of God and man, the addition of God in man. The church has two natures, produced by God being imparted into and mingled with man. If the church had only humanity, it would not be the church, and if the church had only divinity, it also would not be the church. God must be mingled with man and man must be mingled with God in order for the church to exist. The church is the most marvelous thing in the universe because the church contains both the elements of humanity and divinity. The church is both man and God, and God and man. The church has the life of God, which is expressed through the actions of man. The church is God living in man and being mingled with man, moving and living in a way that expresses Himself and accomplishes His purpose. The church is man cooperating with God, taking God as her all and being filled with God (3:19) to be controlled and regulated for the expression of the fullness of the Godhead so that others would say, &ldquo;Indeed God is among you&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:25). This is the proper condition of the church. This is the essence of the church that came into being on the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the church was the expression of God. She was the pillar and base of the truth, manifesting God before many people. She was also the great mystery of godliness, because people could sense that God had filled some men inwardly and was dwelling within them, moving and living through them, and manifesting His glory and power upon them. In them God manifested His glorious person and His powerful works. Since the day of Pentecost, whenever the church is in a proper condition, God is manifested because the church is the mingling of God and man. She is the crystallization of the mingling of God and man.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTIONS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:22-23).</p>
<p>The church being the Body of Christ not only speaks of her relationship to Christ but also of her function toward Christ. A body is the fullness of the head; it is the continuation of the head. Without a body, the head is incomplete. In the same way, the church is the fullness and continuation of Christ. Without the church Christ is incomplete. According to God&rsquo;s thought, it was not good for Adam to be alone, and it is not good for Christ to be without the church (Gen. 2:18-24; Eph. 5:23-32). Adam needed Eve, and Christ needs the church. Just as Eve was the fullness of Adam, the church is the fullness of Christ. Just as the body is a continuation of the head, the church is the continuation of Christ. The church&rsquo;s function with respect to Christ is to be His continuation. With respect to time, the church is the extension of Christ; with respect to space, the church is the enlargement of Christ. Without the church it would not be possible to know Christ today. Without the church it would not have been possible to know Christ outside of Judea. Without the church it would be possible to see Christ only in one place at one time; it would not be possible to see Him in many places at the same time. However, in this universe Christ has a Body, and this Body is the church. Although Christ ascended into heaven, He is on the earth through His Body. Through His Body He has extended Himself into every age and enlarged Himself throughout the entire earth. Through His Body people could see Him in the first century, and they can see Him in the twentieth century. Through His Body people can see Him in Taipei as well as in Jerusalem. Through His Body today people can see Him at the same time all over the earth. Just as the four Gospels show His living in Jesus the Nazarene, the book of Acts shows His living in the church. Actually, the book of Acts is not the story of the apostles; it is the story of the continuation of Christ. This story continues after the Gospels, and it records Christ&rsquo;s movements in many places on earth through His Body, the church. Just as we see Jesus the Nazarene in the Gospels, we see the church in Acts. Just as Acts is the continuation of the Gospels, the church is the continuation of Christ, the fullness of Christ, and the surplus of Christ. The church is Christ continuing, Christ overflowing, and Christ with surplus. Christ conquered sin and death; He conquered the world and the authority of darkness, and the church has inherited these accomplishments. Christ went to the cross, fulfilled God&rsquo;s purpose, and dealt with Satan, and the church inherits these matters on a universal scale. The church inherits Christ&rsquo;s accomplishments and continues Christ.</p>
<p>The first function of the church in the universe is to inherit Christ, extend Christ, and spread Christ; the church does this in time and space&mdash;the universe&mdash;to be Christ&rsquo;s fullness for the expression of Christ. The church is the development of Christ so that all things in the universe would know Christ&rsquo;s fullness and riches. The millions of believers throughout the ages are part of His universal great Body for His full expression.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;All the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord...into a dwelling place of God in spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:21-22).</p>
<p>The second function of the church is to be God&rsquo;s holy temple, the dwelling place of God on earth. God&rsquo;s dwelling place is in the heavens, but God wants to express His glory and to carry out His will on earth, so He needs a dwelling place on earth. In the Old Testament God used the tabernacle and the temple among the children of Israel to express His glory and to carry out His will. The tabernacle and the temple are types of the church. In the New Testament the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth through which He can express His glory and to carry out His will. The church on earth expresses God&rsquo;s glory and causes God&rsquo;s will to be carried out.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;You...are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the temple in which God lived was a building, and the priests who offered sacrifices to Him were a group of people, but in the New Testament both the temple in which God lives and the priests who offer sacrifices to Him are the church. The church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place to express His glory and to carry out His will, and the church is also a holy priesthood that offers spiritual sacrifices to God, which includes praise, caring for the needs of the saints (Heb. 13:15-16), faith toward God (Phil. 2:17), the believers themselves (Rom. 15:16), and the practical service of the believers (12:1). Thus, the church&rsquo;s function on earth is to be a group of people who are God&rsquo;s dwelling place and who serve Him.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 3:15).</p>
<p>The church on earth is the dwelling place of God; the church is His house. As the house of God, the church speaks not only of the church&rsquo;s relationship to God but also of the church&rsquo;s function with respect to God. In a house one finds a dwelling, obtains rest, expresses his heart&rsquo;s desire, and accomplishes his will. As the house of God, the church&rsquo;s function toward God, is for Him to find a dwelling, obtain rest, express His heart&rsquo;s desire, and accomplish His will on earth. In a proper local church, God will gain these four things.</p>
<p>When the church provides these four things, God is able to dwell and place all that He is in the church. In this regard the church functions as the pillar and base of all the truth related to God. On the earth the church supports and maintains all the truth concerning God. All the truth concerning God is supported and maintained by the church. If people on earth today want to know God and the things concerning Him, they must come to the church. This is another great function of the church with respect to God. On the earth today the church is a place for God to make His home, and the church also testifies concerning the things of God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;To Him be the glory in the church&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:21).</p>
<p>All the functions of the church with respect to God are so that He may be glorified. To glorify God is to express God. The church expresses God in the universe. Although all things express a part of God, the church is the only thing that fully expresses Him. All the fullness of the Godhead&mdash;His heart&rsquo;s desire, nature, wisdom, and work&mdash;is expressed through the church so that He may be completely glorified for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 3:10).</p>
<p>The church also makes known the multifarious wisdom of God to the rulers and authorities in the heavenlies, especially to Satan and the angels who followed him in his rebellion against God. Through the church, God wants to display His wisdom to Satan and his followers. Although Satan rebelled against God, damaged the man created by God, and hindered and damaged God&rsquo;s works, God brought forth the church from among damaged humanity to be His dwelling place on earth for His habitation and fullness, to be mingled with Him to express His glory, and to carry out His purpose to deal with His enemies. This is God&rsquo;s great wisdom! Through the church, God makes His wisdom known to Satan and his angels in order to put them to shame.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:18).</p>
<p>The final function of the church is to deal with God&rsquo;s enemies, which include Satan and the authority of Hades. Because of this function, Satan and the authority of Hades seek to damage the church in many ways, but the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. The church will overcome because the church is produced, built up, joined, and mingled with the overcoming Christ. The church on earth today has a great mission to deal with Satan and his authority by relying on the victorious Christ. This is another great function of the church with respect to God.</p><h2 class="head1">THOSE INCLUDED IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Those who believed&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:44; see also 4:32).</p>
<p>The church includes those who have believed. Only those who believe are included in the church. To believe does not mean to merely believe the truth of the gospel, much less to believe a religion. It is to believe in the Lord Jesus and to receive Him as the Savior, thereby obtaining His life. Only those who believe and who receive the Lord are included in the church.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Those who were being saved&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:47).</p>
<p>Those who have believed are those who are being saved. Once a person believes in the Lord, he is saved; once he receives the Lord as His Savior, he receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. The church includes only those who are saved by faith. A false believer, one who has not been saved, is not included in the church.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Disciples&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 11:26).</p>
<p>A person who believes in the Lord and is saved wants to follow the Lord and to receive His teaching. Thus, believers are the Lord&rsquo;s disciples. Only those who have been saved by the Lord and who want to follow the Lord and to receive His teachings are included in the church. Those who are Christians in name only are not in the church because they have not believed or been saved.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<p>All who have believed in the Lord and are saved are sanctified in Christ. They are sanctified by God; they are saints called out of the world by God. Those in the church are sanctified, the called saints. False believers are not in the church.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Members of His Body&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:30; see also 1 Cor. 12:27; Rom. 12:5).</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ; consequently, those who are in the church are members of the Body of Christ. In order to be a member and to participate in Christ, one must be saved, which is to obtain the life of Christ and to be joined to Christ. Since nominal Christians do not have the life of Christ, they are not members of the Body of Christ. Thus, they have no part in the church. They can participate in Christianity as a religion, but they cannot participate in the church as the Body of Christ. The church is the Body of Christ, which is joined to Christ through His life and nature; false believers cannot be members of the Body of Christ, because they do not have the life of Christ. All true believers have the life of Christ and are joined to Christ. Only believers who are joined to Christ as members of the Body are in the church.</p>
<p>Today people may have false teeth, false eyes, or false legs. These things appear to be members of the human body, but they do not have the life of the human body and cannot be joined in oneness with the body. In the same way, many false believers have been brought together into so-called &ldquo;churches.&rdquo; They appear to be members, but they do not have the life of the church, which is the life of Christ and the life of the Body of Christ. Therefore, they are not members of the Body of Christ and cannot be joined in one Body with the church. Strictly speaking, they are not in the church. They are merely in Christianity and have a false name of being those in the church.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;My brothers...&lsquo;the children whom God has given to Me&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:12-13).</p>
<p>Since the church includes only those who are saved and have the Lord&rsquo;s life, the church includes those who are the Lord&rsquo;s brothers and God&rsquo;s children. Since the church is the house of God and is joined to God with His life and nature, those who are in the church must be born of God and be God&rsquo;s children in order to be the Lord&rsquo;s brothers and heirs of God with the Lord. Anyone who does not have a life relationship with God has no part in the church and is not a member of the church as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;As living stones&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>Those who have been regenerated by God to have His life and nature are living stones. <em>Living</em> means that they have been made alive in their spirit; they are not deadened in spirit without the life of God. It is not difficult to know whether a person has been made alive in his spirit, just as it is not difficult to know whether a person is living or dead. As soon as we touch a person&rsquo;s body, we know whether it is living or dead. Similarly, it is easy to tell whether a person is living or dead spiritually. Our spirit has a spontaneous sensation. We speak with people before they get baptized in order to sense whether they have truly been made alive in spirit. This is not difficult to discern or sense. Anyone who has touched God inwardly will be alive in spirit; anyone who has simply believed some doctrines will be dead. The spirit cannot be made alive through doctrinal teachings. The Holy Spirit must be imparted into the human spirit in order for it to be living. Once the Holy Spirit is imparted, the human spirit is made alive. Doctrinal teachings cannot enliven the spirit. The church includes only those who have an enlivened human spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH AND SECTS</h2>
<p>There are many denominations in Christianity today, such as the Lutheran Church, the Presbyterian Church, the Baptist Church, and the Episcopalian Church. These denominations are divisions, and divisions are sects. We need to see what the Bible says about denominations and sects.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Holy Father, keep them...that they may be one&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:11; see also vv. 21-23).</p>
<p>Before His death the Lord prayed to the Father that His disciples, the church, would be one. This shows the Lord&rsquo;s desire for the church to be one, rather than to be divided. He desires that the church on earth would be like the Triune God, completely without division and wholly one. The divided condition of today&rsquo;s Christianity goes against the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and will, and it damages the Lord&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;There shall be one flock&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:16).</p>
<p>The Lord not only prayed for the church to be one, but He also made the believers, who are His sheep, into one flock, whether they were saved from among the Jews or from among the Gentiles. Originally, the Jews could not be one with the Gentiles, but in the church the Lord wants the Jews and the Gentiles to be one and does not allow them to be divided. Thus, sects or divisions in the church go against the Lord&rsquo;s way for the church. They damage the unifying work of the Lord that gathered His believers into one flock.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Those who believed were together...with one accord&rdquo;; &ldquo;The heart and soul of the multitude of those who had believed was one&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:44, 46; 4:32).</p>
<p>Based on the Lord&rsquo;s prayer and work to make the church one, the church was one when it was first produced. In the beginning the church was one in every place, and the believers were together in one accord, having one heart and one soul; there was absolutely no situation involving sectarianism. The presence of sects in the church is the result of the church deviating from God&rsquo;s plan and losing its initial oneness. This is absolutely improper.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ. Is Christ divided?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:12-13; see also 3:3-4).</p>
<p>The original condition of oneness in the church began to disappear with the church in Corinth. At that time there were sectarian parties among them. Some said, &ldquo;I am of Paul&rdquo;; others said, &ldquo;I am of Apollos&rdquo;; and still others said, &ldquo;I am of Cephas&rdquo;; whereas another group was formed, seeming to say, &ldquo;You are all wrong. We are of Christ.&rdquo; This division into sects damaged the essential oneness of the church. Therefore, the apostle rebuked them, saying, &ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo; Since Christ is one and not divided, those who are in Christ, who are joined to Christ, and who have Christ as their life should not be divided either. Sectarian matters that divide the Body of Christ are not of Christ or the Holy Spirit. They are of man&rsquo;s flesh and should be condemned. The apostle clearly pointed out this sectarian situation to the church in Corinth.</p>
<p>The Corinthian believers said, &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; &ldquo;I of Apollos,&rdquo; &ldquo;I of Cephas,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I of Christ.&rdquo; They were all rebuked and condemned by the Holy Spirit through the apostle. How can believers who say, &ldquo;I am Baptist,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am Lutheran,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am Presbyterian,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I am Anglican,&rdquo; be approved and justified by the one Holy Spirit? Regrettably, many believers think that they can openly denominate themselves. They seem to think that sects are not improper. All the sects and denominations in today&rsquo;s Christianity use denominational titles to officially name and designate themselves without the slightest feeling of shame. They think that their names are proper and glorious. They are truly filled with the spirit of Corinth and should be rebuked. May the children of God set their mind on the Spirit and walk according to the Spirit in condemning the sectarian spirit and the denominational names that divide the Body of Christ until all God&rsquo;s children feel the shame of sectarianism and reject these denominational names.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;One Body&rdquo;; &ldquo;We who are many are one Body&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:4; 1 Cor. 10:17).</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and Christ is the Head of the church. There is only one Head, and there is only one Body. Although there are many in the church, there is only one Body. There are millions of people here and abroad and throughout the ages who have been saved and who are part of the church. Although there are many members, there is only one Body. Therefore, the church should be one; it should not be divided into denominations. Any sect in Christianity, no matter how good or high it is, violates the principle of the Body of Christ and damages the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:3).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit lives within the believers, making them one Body, and gives the believers an intrinsic oneness. The Spirit who makes us one leads us to be one with the children of God. We should not damage the oneness of God&rsquo;s children by not keeping the oneness of the Spirit. God requires us to bear a great responsibility toward the church by being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit, which we already have, and by not damaging this oneness. God wants us to diligently keep the oneness of the Spirit in the Body of Christ by avoiding any sectarian element. In order to understand the nature of a sect, we need to consider six factors related to sects. If any one of these six factors is present among a group of Christians, it is a sect. These six factors include:</p>
<p>1. Special names&mdash;In the universe the church is unique and has no need of a special name. The church is just the church. No matter where it is, it is only the church. Once the church takes a special name, it loses its unique character and becomes a sect. A special name separates out and gathers a group of believers into that name. This separates them from other believers. Some groups in Christianity are named after a belief, such as the &ldquo;Justification-by-faith Church&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Holiness Church&rdquo;; some are named after their system of administration, such as the Presbyterian Church and the Congregational Church; some take their names from their rituals, such as the Baptist Church; some denominate themselves according to a man&rsquo;s name, such as the Lutherans and Wesleyans; some are named after countries, such as the Anglican Church and the Chinese Christian Church. Regardless of its source, a special name divides the believers into sects because it separates a group of believers from other believers.</p>
<p>2. Special creeds&mdash;The church includes all those who share the common faith that saves us, the one faith spoken of in Ephesians 4:5. This faith is held in common by all who are saved (2 Pet. 1:1). This faith causes the believers to be one and does not divide them. Any creed or system of teaching that goes beyond the common faith divides the believers. Even the exposition of the Bible can cause the believers to become a sect if it goes beyond the faith. Furthermore, opinions related to doctrines that go beyond the common faith, such as baptism by sprinkling, baptism by immersion, keeping the Sabbath, keeping the Lord&rsquo;s Day, head covering, foot washing, and the posttribulation rapture or pretribulation rapture, divide the believers into sects if they become a requirement for fellowship and a central point around which a group of believers gathers. Even if some of these teachings and opinions are right and scriptural, we cannot make them a requirement for fellowship with other believers or the central point around which we gather. If these teachings become requirements or a central point, they become special creeds that create sects.</p>
<p>3. Special fellowship&mdash;Everyone who is saved and has the life of Christ is a member of the Body of Christ; therefore, these ones can participate in the fellowship of the Body, which is the fellowship of the church. If a Christian group considers that a person who is saved and who has the life of Christ must also believe in a special creed as a requirement for fellowship, this special fellowship makes them into a sect.</p>
<p>4. Isolated rather than universal fellowship&mdash;The Body of Christ is universal, so the fellowship of Christ&rsquo;s Body, the church, is also universal. Any fellowship that is limited to one locality and does not extend to the other local churches on the earth, even if it does not have a special creed that dictates a special fellowship, is isolated and is not part of the universal fellowship. Isolated fellowship causes believers to become a local sect.</p>
<p>5. Separate administration in the same locality&mdash;The church in each locality should be one; it should not be divided. This oneness is maintained by one administration. Even if there is a need to meet in several places within one locality because of the number of people, the administration of the local church should still be one. If the administration in a local church is divided, the believers will be divided into sects.</p>
<p>6. Belonging to an organization&mdash;The church in any locality must only be a local church; it should not belong to any Christian organization. Although a local church should have fellowship in Christ with the churches in other localities, it should not have an organizational relationship with any Christian organization. Once it has an organizational relationship with a Christian organization, it takes on the background of that organization and becomes a sect.</p>
<p>Any of these items divide the Body of Christ and cause believers to become a sect. Therefore, these items should be condemned and rejected. In order to keep the oneness of the church, we must avoid these things. God hates sects and divisions in the church. God&rsquo;s work in the church is to eliminate these kinds of things (1 Cor. 12:24-25). He also wants us to care for His heart&rsquo;s desire and to join together without being sectarian (1:10). Although it is difficult to avoid sects, we must hate the divisions of denominations and be one who is approved by God (11:19).</p><h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Essence of the Oneness of the Church</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The oneness of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:3).</p>
<p>The church is formed by the Holy Spirit bringing the life of Christ, which is Christ Himself, into the believers, joining them in oneness in Him. The Holy Spirit makes the church one Body (1 Cor. 12:13). Therefore, the Holy Spirit is the church&rsquo;s intrinsic oneness, which is the essence of the church&rsquo;s oneness. The Holy Spirit as the church&rsquo;s intrinsic oneness is possessed by every believer. Every believer is indwelt by the Holy Spirit. Since we have the Holy Spirit, we have the intrinsic oneness of the church. The Holy Spirit within us is the oneness of the church. Since we have this oneness within us, we do not need to seek to gain the oneness of the church; we need only to live in the Holy Spirit and not break the oneness of the Holy Spirit. The oneness of the Holy Spirit must be kept and manifested among us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Reality of the Oneness of the Church</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;One Body and one Spirit, even as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:4-6).</p>
<p>The church has not only the essence of oneness but also the reality of oneness, which has several aspects. First, the Body is one Body. Second, the Holy Spirit is one. Third, the hope of the church to enter into glory is one. Fourth, the faith that saves the church out of the old creation and into the new creation is one. Fifth, the baptism by which the church leaves Adam and enters into Christ is one. Sixth, the Lord to whom the church belongs and serves is one. Seventh, the God who is through the church and lives within the church and who is the Father who begets everyone in the church is one. Since every aspect of the reality of the church is one, the church is one and cannot be divided. Division violates the reality of this oneness and damages the church by causing her to suffer loss. Division does not perfect the church or benefit her.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Fellowship of the Apostles</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:42).</p>
<p>Those who believed on Pentecost kept not only the apostles&rsquo; teaching but also the apostles&rsquo; fellowship. The teaching of the apostles is the teaching given to the apostles by the Lord in His commission to them. The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship given to the apostles by the Lord. The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship of the church. Whoever has a part in the church has a part in this fellowship. Whoever is in the church is in this fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;(We...report to you the eternal life)...that you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:2-3).</p>
<p>The fellowship of the apostles is the fellowship with God and with the Lord Jesus. The apostles report the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life so that we may have fellowship with them. When we receive the eternal life that they report, we are brought into their fellowship so that we may have fellowship with them. This fellowship is the fellowship of the church. Whoever receives the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life participates in this fellowship and is in the fellowship. Therefore, this fellowship is the fellowship of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Fellowship of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The fellowship of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:14; see also Phil. 2:1).</p>
<p>Since the Holy Spirit makes the believers one Body (1 Cor. 12:13), the fellowship of the church as the Body is also the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. Whoever receives the Holy Spirit by believing in the Lord participates in this fellowship. Whoever lives in the Holy Spirit also lives in this fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Fellowship of the Body</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ? Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:16-17).</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ; therefore, the fellowship of the church is also the fellowship of the Body. Whoever becomes a member of the Body of Christ through being saved, regardless of his race, nationality, or social class, participates in this fellowship (12:13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Fellowship of the One Faith</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;One Body...one faith&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:4-5).</p>
<p>We become part of the Body of Christ through faith. This one faith is the basic faith through which we are saved. Therefore, the fellowship of the Body of Christ is also the fellowship of this one faith. Whoever has this one faith, regardless of his views, beliefs, and opinions on any other point of the truth, participates in this fellowship. This fellowship receives all who have this one faith (Rom. 14:1-6; 15:7).</p><h2 class="head2">Removal from the Fellowship of the Church</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not to mingle with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one not even to eat&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:11).</p>
<p>If a believer commits any of the sins listed in verse 11, he should be removed from the fellowship of the church lest he corrupt the entire church (vv. 1-8).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Those who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh...Everyone who goes beyond and does not abide in the teaching of Christ does not have God; he who abides in the teaching, he has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice! For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works&rdquo;</strong> (2 John 7, 9-11).</p>
<p>If a person says that he is a Christian but does not believe Christ is God incarnate, he goes beyond the teaching of Christ and does not abide in it. Today&rsquo;s so-called modernists who accept this teaching should be removed from the fellowship of the church lest the believers share in their evil works.</p>
<p>With the exception of the gross sins described in 1 Corinthians 5 and the belief that Jesus Christ has not come in the flesh, any failure, weakness, error, or improper opinion concerning the truth that a believer may have does not constitute sufficient reason for removing him from the fellowship of the church. Although the apostle Paul ordered the church in Corinth to remove the person who had committed one of the sins in 1 Corinthians 5, he did not tell the church to remove those who were sectarian (1:11-12; 3:1-4), the one who went to law against another brother (6:1-8), or those who did not believe in the resurrection of the dead (15:12). The fellowship of the church is a fellowship of oneness that includes all believers who are saved by faith and have the Lord&rsquo;s life and the Holy Spirit. Apart from the reasons listed above, no one should be excluded from participating in this fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPRESSION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The church which was in Jerusalem&rdquo;; &ldquo;The church of God which is in Corinth&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 8:1; 1 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the essence of the church is one universally, and the expression of the church is one locally. In this age the expression of the church is according to locality. The first expression of the church was in Jerusalem, and later the church was expressed in many localities in Judea and in Gentile regions, such as Antioch, Ephesus, and Corinth. Wherever the church is expressed, it is the church in that locality. Every local expression is a local church. A locality can have only one expression of the church; it cannot have two or more expressions. In the universe the church is essentially one; therefore, in this age the expression of the church should also be one in a locality. In the early days Jerusalem was a very large city with thousands of believers (Acts 21:20), but there was only one expression of the church in that city. The many believers, although meeting in many homes (2:46; 5:42), were the one church in Jerusalem. If the believers had separated into two or more churches in that city, they would have brought division into the church and caused the church to lose its expression of oneness in that locality. The Bible speaks of a city having not more than one expression of the church. When it speaks of churches, it is in reference to a province or region, which includes several cities and thus several churches, such as &ldquo;the churches of Asia&rdquo; (1 Cor. 16:19), &ldquo;the churches of Galatia&rdquo; (Gal. 1:2), or &ldquo;the churches&rdquo; in other provinces and regions (Acts 15:41; Gal. 1:22; Rom. 16:4; 2 Cor. 8:1). In one locality there can be only one expression of the church. The expression of the church cannot be larger than a locality, nor can it be smaller than a locality. If it is larger than a locality, the churches will become a federation, and the churches will lose their purity, which comes from living directly before Christ the Head in one locality. If a church is smaller than a locality by being divided into two or more churches, the church will lose its one expression in that locality. In order to preserve the purity of the local church and the oneness of the church in a locality, there cannot be national, provincial, or regional churches that are larger than a locality, nor can there be street, neighborhood, or house churches that are smaller than a locality. There can only be one church in one locality.</p>
<p>The Bible refers to a church in a believer&rsquo;s house because the church in that locality was small and met in a believer&rsquo;s home. Thus, it was referred to as the church in a believer&rsquo;s house. In this case the church in the house was equivalent to a local church. In other words, even in a locality with a small number of believers, there can only be one church in a house; there cannot be churches in two or more houses. The church that met in the house of Prisca and Aquila in Romans 16:5 was the church in Rome. The church that met in the house of Aquila and Prisca in 1 Corinthians 16:19 was the church in Ephesus, because Prisca and Aquila moved from Rome to Ephesus (Acts 18:2, 18-19). Later, in the Lord&rsquo;s epistle to the church in Ephesus in Revelation, He spoke of only one church there (2:1), proving the foregoing fact. The church in the house of Nymphas in Colossians 4:15 was the church in Laodicea mentioned in the second half of verse 16. Later, in the Lord&rsquo;s epistle to the church in Laodicea in Revelation, He also spoke of only one church there (3:14). The church in the house of Philemon mentioned in Philemon 2 was the church in Colossae at that time (Col. 1:2; 4:17, pay attention to <em>Colossae</em> and <em>Archippus</em>). Thus, the churches in the Bible that were in houses were local churches.</p>
<p>There can only be one manifestation of the church in a locality. This is clearly revealed in the New Testament. If there are many believers in one locality, they can be divided into different meetings, but they cannot be divided into different churches. In a locality that has a church, two or three believers can meet in the Lord&rsquo;s name. However, this does not mean that they alone are the church, because if there are difficulties, they must still tell these matters to the church (Matt. 18:20, 16-17). In one locality there can be only one church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being the Oneness of the Church</h2>
<p>The ground of the church is the oneness of the church. Whoever loses the oneness of the church, the oneness of the church&rsquo;s fellowship, loses the ground of the church. Any ground apart from the oneness of the church and the oneness of her fellowship is not the ground of the church. The divisive, sectarian ground of Roman Catholicism and of many Christian denominations is not the ground of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Local</h2>
<p>Since the expression of the church is local, the church&rsquo;s practical ground is also based on locality. The universal oneness and fellowship of the church is expressed locally. There should be only one church in a locality, and in a locality the church should have only one fellowship. This ground is the ground of oneness in a locality. Any ground apart from the local ground of oneness is not the ground of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESIGNATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since the church is uniquely one in her universal essence and in her local expression, she should not have a name, either universally or locally. The church is the church; she does not need another name, just as the moon is the moon and does not need another name. Although the Bible uses a few phrases to describe the persons to whom the church belongs and the places where the church is, these descriptions are not the church&rsquo;s name. Let us examine these descriptive phrases.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The church of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;The churches of God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:28; 1 Cor. 10:32; 15:9; 11:16).</p>
<p>The first description of the church is &ldquo;the church of God,<em>&rdquo;</em> or &ldquo;the churches of God.&rdquo; This means that the church belongs to God and includes all God&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;All the churches of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 16:16).</p>
<p>The second description is &ldquo;the churches of Christ.&rdquo; This means that the church was purchased by Christ for Himself by the shedding of His blood. It also means that He has regenerated and made the church His Body by His life. The church includes all whom He has redeemed and who possess His life.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The churches of the saints&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 14:33).</p>
<p>The third description is &ldquo;the churches of the saints.&rdquo; This means that the church is composed of the saints and includes all the saints.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The church which was in Jerusalem&rdquo;; &ldquo;The church of God which is in Corinth&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 8:1; 1 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<p>With the exception of the preceding three descriptions, which tell us to whom the church belongs, the Bible describes a church in relation to its location. For example, it says &ldquo;the church which was in Jerusalem&rdquo; and &ldquo;the church of God which is in Corinth.&rdquo; These expressions merely describe the location of a church but do not denominate the church by the name of its locality. The name of the locality is not the name of the church. The Bible uses these four descriptions to indicate to whom the church belongs and where a church is located, but these descriptions are not names. A name encloses a small number of God&rsquo;s children, separating them from the rest of God&rsquo;s children and forming them into a sect. The many names in Christianity today are sectarian names that prove the existence of division.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ and the house of God. The Body of Christ emphasizes the universal aspect of the church. The house of God emphasizes the local aspect of the church. Since the church has these two aspects, the organization of the church also has two aspects: gifts, which emphasize the universal aspect of the Body of Christ, and offices, which emphasize the local aspect of the house of God. These two aspects are related to each other, but there is a clear distinction as well.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Gifts for the Universal Church,<br />
Emphasizing the Body of Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He Himself gave some as apostles and some as prophets and some as evangelists and some as shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:11-12).</p>
<p>The Lord gave gifts for the building up of His Body. These gifts are spiritual abilities given to the believers through the Holy Spirit. On the one hand, the Lord through the Holy Spirit gives spiritual abilities as gifts to certain believers to enable them to build up His Body; on the other hand, He gives certain believers who have these spiritual abilities as gifts to His church for the establishing and building up of the church. These people, who have special spiritual gifts and who are given as gifts by the Lord to the church, are for the building up of the churches everywhere. They are given for the building up of the universal church, not just for the building up of one local church. These gifts consist of four kinds of people.</p><h2 class="head3">Apostles</h2>
<p>Apostles are the first gifts given by the Lord to the church. They represent the highest office that God established in the universal church (1 Cor. 12:28; Rom. 1:5), and they have the authority to establish churches in every locality. The apostles are ordained by God Himself, not by man; they are sent directly by God, not by man. God specially appoints and sends them to work for Him in every place to establish churches (Acts 8:14, 25; 13:2; 14:14, 21-23). These apostles are not limited to the twelve apostles appointed by the Lord in the beginning. In addition to these twelve, many other apostles were appointed by God, such as Paul, Barnabas (v. 14), Sylvanus, Timothy (1 Thes. 1:1; 2:6), the Lord&rsquo;s brother James (Gal. 1:19), &ldquo;our brothers&rdquo; (2 Cor. 8:23), and so on. In addition to the many apostles appointed by God, there are self-proclaimed apostles; but these are false apostles (Rev. 2:2; 2 Cor. 11:13).</p>
<p>Although the highest office established by God relates to the apostles, these apostles should not be regarded as a special group of exceedingly excellent men. They are merely workers commissioned by God to preach the gospel and establish churches. Whoever has been commissioned by God and has been sent by God to preach the gospel, to bring salvation to others, to impart the Holy Spirit, to increase and spread the Body of Christ (vv. 4-5), and to preach God&rsquo;s word to others is an apostle (2 Pet. 3:2). The proof of one&rsquo;s apostleship is in the fruit of his work (1 Cor. 9:1-2) and in his power&mdash;the power of the life that bears all things and the miraculous power to work miracles (2 Cor. 12:11-12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Prophets</h2>
<p>Prophets are gifts with the ability to speak for God to build up the church (1 Cor. 12:28). Primarily, they speak for God in an ordinary way through the power of the Holy Spirit (Rom. 12:6), but they also can receive the miraculous power of the Holy Spirit to foretell the future (1 Cor. 12:10). Whether they foretell the future or preach in an ordinary way, prophets speak for God in the power of the Holy Spirit; therefore, they have the authority of God, the ability to impart the revelation of God, the ability to establish and build up the church, and the ability to convict unbelievers (14:24-25).</p>
<p>Although a prophet fulfills his ministry of speaking for God in a local church (Acts 13:1), he can speak for God as a prophet in any place. Agabus, Judas, and Silas were prophets in the church in Jerusalem, but they also could speak for God when they went to Antioch or Caesarea. They spoke in an ordinary way to edify others and also in a miraculous way (11:27-28; 21:8-11; 15:22, 30, 32).</p>
<p>Prophets are the greatest gift for the building up of the church because their speaking imparts a spiritual supply (1 Cor. 14:1, 4-5). Just as apostles are the highest office for establishing the church, prophets are the greatest gift for the building up of the church. The Bible acknowledges the importance of these offices by saying that the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">Evangelists</h2>
<p>Evangelists are appointed by God to preach the gospel. They have a particular gospel work as their ministry. Philip was such a person (Acts 21:8). The work of the prophets and teachers is directed primarily toward those who are the church for their building up. The work of the evangelists is directed primarily toward unbelievers for their salvation to be brought into the church. Such a gospel work must be carried out in many places. For example, Philip was originally in Jerusalem, but later he went to Samaria and to other cities to preach the gospel (8:5-12, 26-40; 21:8). Although evangelists may save many through their preaching of the gospel, the establishment of local churches is not part of the measure of an evangelist. The responsibility of establishing local churches has been measured to the apostles (cf. 8:5-12, 14-17). Evangelists can go to many places to preach the gospel, but apostles must establish churches in these places.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Shepherds and Teachers</h2>
<p>Shepherds and teachers are also gifts to the church. Shepherding the church involves teaching the church, and teaching the church involves shepherding the church. A shepherd and teacher is one person with a gift that involves two aspects. Shepherds and teachers receive grace from God to have a heart to care for the believers, and they understand God&rsquo;s Word and can lead believers according to the teachings of the Bible. In their ministry they shepherd and teach by using God&rsquo;s Word to feed, cultivate, and teach the church. Prophets preach the word of God according to revelation, whereas shepherds and teachers preach the revealed word of God. Prophets speak God&rsquo;s revelation; shepherds and teachers teach what God has revealed. They teach the church according to God&rsquo;s revealed truth so that the believers might be established and built up in the light of God&rsquo;s truth. Like prophets, shepherds and teachers principally exercise their ministry in a local church (13:1) but can also shepherd and teach the church of God in every place. In the early days Apollos was a shepherd and teacher. Whether he was in Ephesus or Corinth, he taught and watered people with God&rsquo;s word (18:24&mdash;19:1; 1 Cor. 3:6).</p>
<p>Gifts are given to the church by Christ; they cannot be appointed by man. They can be given only by Christ, the ascended Head. In the giving of gifts, there is room only for the authority of Christ the Head.</p><h2 class="head2">Offices for the Local Churches,<br />
Emphasizing the House of God</h2>
<p>To build up His church God not only gives gifts to the universal church but also provides different offices for a local church. The gifts that are given involve God&rsquo;s sending or appointment. Gifts are for the universal church, whereas offices relate to the local churches. The universal church emphasizes the aspect of the Body of Christ, and the local churches emphasize the aspect of the house of God. The Body of Christ is an organic constitution; it is spiritual and of life. Being organic, it cannot be organized by man. It is altogether under the headship of Christ, and the gifts that are given to the Body come directly from Christ. Their appointment is completely apart from human hands. The house of God, however, involves an element of human administration. In this regard, the local aspect of the church involves the participation of human hands because the offices of the house of God are arranged and appointed by God through men&mdash;the apostles. A gift involves the organic aspect of the Body of Christ and cannot be based on an appointment by human hands. An office related to the house of God is administrative and therefore involves appointment by human hands. Although a person cannot arrange the members of his human body, he can arrange the members of his household. The focus of the Body of Christ is related to growth, but the focus of the house of God is related to building. Since the Body is not a dead organization but a living organism, it does not need the human work of an organizational arrangement in order to spontaneously grow in life. However, a house always involves some element of administration. Although the house of God is built up by the growth in life of the children of God, it must have some element of administrative arrangement. There are two offices in the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Elders</h2>
<h2 class="head4">The Duties of the Elders</h2>
<p>Elders oversee and administrate a local church (1 Tim. 5:17; 3:5). Thus, they are also called overseers (Acts 20:28). The term <em>elders</em> refers to their person, meaning that they are mature. The term <em>overseers</em> refers to their responsibility to oversee. <em>Oversee</em> means to look upon from above, or to care for from above. In the house of God&mdash;the local churches&mdash;the overseers are stewards (Titus 1:7). They are responsible for the administration of a local church, directing and caring for all people and matters related to the church. Therefore, they surely represent a local church.</p>
<p>Elders must not only administrate a local church but also teach and shepherd the local church (1 Tim. 5:17; Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:1-2). In administrating, the emphasis is on business affairs; in teaching and shepherding, the emphasis is on the spiritual aspect. In the church there are many matters that require administration, and there are also many believers who need teaching and shepherding. Some elders &ldquo;take the lead well&rdquo; (1 Tim. 5:17), whereas others are &ldquo;apt to teach&rdquo; and can &ldquo;exhort by the healthy teaching and...convict those who oppose&rdquo; (3:2; Titus 1:9). They are responsible for the preaching, teaching, and shepherding in a local church. The strength of a local church depends on whether or not its elders take the lead well and are apt to teach. May there be brothers in every locality who aspire to be this kind of person (1 Tim. 3:1).</p>
<p>Since the elders are the administrators of a local church, they must also care for the financial affairs of the local church (Acts 11:29-30). Since the elders are the shepherds of the local church, they need to pray over sick believers, anointing them with oil (James 5:14). The elders direct the local church, so they join the apostles to resolve the problems that arise between their locality and other local churches (Acts 15:2, 4, 6, 22-23; 16:4). Since the elders are the representatives of a local church, they lay hands on others together with the apostles (1 Tim. 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Number of Elders</h2>
<p>There should be more than one elder in each locality. The Bible speaks of elders (Acts 11:30; 14:23; 15:2; 20:17; 1 Tim. 5:17; Titus 1:5; James 5:14), presbytery (1 Tim. 4:14), and overseers (Phil. 1:1). God does not want only one person to lead a local church, because it would be easy for him to move independently according to his will and become puffed up. God wants several brothers to be elders in a locality so that they can coordinate together under Christ the Head, submitting to one another to preserve the mutual nature of the church and to avoid the pitfall of individualism.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Appointment of the Elders</h2>
<p>Elders are appointed by the apostles. Sometimes they are chosen by the apostles themselves (Acts 14:23), and sometimes they are appointed by others at the command of the apostles (Titus 1:5). First, there will be some brothers in a local church who are more willing to pay the price and whose spiritual growth and weight are expressed in their spiritual growth and maturity. As they take the lead in spiritual matters, the apostles or those commanded by the apostles will appoint some as elders in that local church according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. Thus, elders are not appointed according to human will despite the fact that they are appointed by the human hands of the apostles or those with the command of the apostles. Elders are appointed according to the will of the Holy Spirit and are placed by the Holy Spirit (Acts 20:28). The Holy Spirit shows that certain ones are elders among the brothers, and the Holy Spirit leads the apostles and those with the command of the apostles to appoint them as elders. Thus, man follows what the Holy Spirit makes known.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the elders of a local church grow into their function as an elder. Among the brothers, the spiritual life of certain ones grows into the shape of an elder. For the sake of emphasizing their responsibility and to avoid confusion, the apostles confirm this spiritual arrangement. This is completely different from the way of Christianity, which often chooses elders by general election. An election by ballot is not based upon life and spiritual weight; instead, it follows the way of the world by focusing on a person&rsquo;s position, political power, education, or talent. The appointment of elders in a local church, who are manifested and set apart by the Holy Spirit, is related only to their level of life and spiritual weight so that the church might obtain edification in life and leading in spiritual matters.</p><h2 class="head4">The Discipline of the Elders</h2>
<p>Since elders are appointed by the apostles, brothers and sisters should make an accusation against an elder only to the apostles (1 Tim. 5:19-20). <em>The ones who sin</em> in verse 20 refers to the elders. Since the eldership involves the highest office in a local church, the brothers and sisters do not have the authority to appoint elders or the authority to deal with them. Discipline is related to the apostles&rsquo; authority and responsibility.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Qualifications of the Elders</h2>
<p>The verses in 1 Timothy 3:2-7 and Titus 1:6-9 speak of the principles that an elder must manifest, including being orderly, sober-minded, self-controlled, experienced, hospitable, apt to teach, and able to administrate.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Deacons</h2>
<p>The second office in a local church relates to deacons. There are only the offices of elders and deacons in a local church. In the church in Philippi, there were only overseers (elders) and deacons serving the saints (Phil. 1:1). The apostles commanded that only overseers (elders) and deacons be appointed in the local churches (1 Tim. 3:1-13). There are five points concerning the office of the deacons.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Duties of the Deacons</h2>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;deacon&rdquo; means &ldquo;serving one.&rdquo; Therefore, the duty of the deacons is to serve a local church, to bear responsibility for the general affairs of a local church. Elders bear the responsibility for managing a local church; deacons bear the responsibility for handling the general affairs of the local church. In the local church the elders make decisions and direct people, whereas the deacons carry out matters under the elders&rsquo; direction. The deacons serve the local church under the management and leading of the elders.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Number of Deacons</h2>
<p>There are many deacons in a local church because the Bible speaks of &ldquo;deacons&rdquo; (Phil. 1:1; 1 Tim. 3:8, 12). Since deacons must serve the church and bear responsibility for the general affairs of the church, it is not possible for one deacon to take care of all the needs. Therefore, there should be several deacons in a local church, and there should be more deacons than elders. The number of deacons in a local church depends on the number of people in that locality and the volume of its general affairs. The number of deacons is determined by need. If there are many saints and many general affairs, there is a need for more serving ones.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Gender of the Deacons</h2>
<p>For propriety in serving the sisters and caring for them in a thorough way, a local church must have some deaconesses. Therefore, the Bible shows that there are deacons and deaconesses (vv. 11-12; Rom. 16:1). Elders must be brothers, but deacons can be brothers or sisters. Since man is the head (1 Cor. 11:3), the elders who head up matters in a local church must be brothers, not sisters. However, the deacons who serve in a local church can be both brothers and sisters.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Appointment of the Deacons</h2>
<p>Deacons are also appointed by the apostles or by those under the command of the apostles (1 Tim. 3:8-13). There are certain brothers and sisters in a local church who manifest more love toward the Lord, more genuine spirituality, and more willingness to serve the church and the saints. As this is revealed by the Holy Spirit, the apostles follow the leading of the Holy Spirit to appoint them as deacons. Their appointment, like that of the elders, is according to the will of the Holy Spirit, but it passes through the hands of the apostles. The Holy Spirit reveals the serving ones among the brothers and sisters and then leads the apostles to appoint them as deacons. As with the elders, man follows what the Holy Spirit makes known.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Qualifications of the Deacons</h2>
<p>The record in 1 Timothy 3:8-13 tells us that deacons must be grave, pure, faithful, and not double-tongued, and they must hold the mystery of the faith.</p>
<p>The administrative arrangement that God has ordained for a local church is marvelous. There is no appointment or termination of service by human election, nor is there a mission board that approves and directs. The administrative arrangement of a local church is completely a matter of the Holy Spirit exercising the authority of the Head. It is arranged neither democratically nor tyrannically, neither according to the opinion of the majority nor the will of an individual. Instead, a group of brothers and sisters under the authority of the Holy Spirit submit to His authority and follow His leading as to who should lead and serve. Everyone submits to the authority of the Holy Spirit and remains under His control to stand in his position and fulfill his responsibility in the service so that the church might carry out its function to serve God and express Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">The Relationship<br />
between the Various Local Churches</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Local Administration</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;To the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea&rdquo;; &ldquo;The seven lampstands are the seven churches&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:11, 20).</p>
<p>We also should understand the relationship between local churches. The New Testament clearly shows that local churches are independently administrated and directly responsible to the Head, Christ. This can be seen with the seven churches in Asia Minor in the first century; each was an individual lampstand living directly before its Head, Christ, and was directly responsible to Him. They did not have a regional board, a central board, a unified council, or other kind of organization. There is no such thing as a head church, branch church, superior church, inferior church, or other form of differentiation. All the churches are equal. No church can control the affairs of another church, nor should any church control the affairs of several other churches. The administration of a church is local and directly under the authority of Christ the Head. In the province of Galatia there were only churches (Gal. 1:2); there was no regional board or general council. In Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, there were churches throughout the region (Acts 9:31); there were no regional boards or general councils. [See footnote 1 on verse 31 of the Recovery Version.] The church in Jerusalem was not the head church of the churches in Judea, nor was the church in Antioch the head church of the Gentile churches. The churches in Ephesus and Corinth were not head churches in their respective regions. Every local church, regardless of its size, is administrated locally and is managed directly by the Head; it is responsible to Him.</p>
<p>God wants every local church to be administered locally so that Christ the Head can have the absolute position in every local church and so that the Holy Spirit can exercise complete authority in every local church. Whenever the church has a general council, a regional council, a unified council, or any kind of organization, it cannot be controlled directly by Christ the Head and cannot be directly under the authority of the Holy Spirit. This kind of organization damages and frustrates the position of Christ the Head and the authority of the Holy Spirit in the church. All general boards, regional councils, unified councils, and other such organizations in Christianity are against the teaching of the Bible. They also damage the position of Christ as Head in the church and frustrate the Holy Spirit in the exercise of His authority in the church. This offends the Lord very much!</p>
<h2 class="head3">Universal Fellowship</h2>
<p>Although the local churches are administered locally, they have the same life and fellowship because they are the one Body of Christ. Although there are many outward expressions of administration, they have only one inward life. Despite the fact that their administration is distinct, their fellowship is not separate.</p>
<p>If a local church is normal and spiritual, her fellowship with other local churches will be sufficient and thorough even though her administration is absolutely independent. She may supply other local churches with the supply of life, spiritual help, and the light of the truth, or she may receive the same from other churches. Furthermore, a strong and large local church should bear responsibility to help a weaker and smaller local church in spiritual matters. A weaker and smaller local church should also be willing to receive help from other churches. In conclusion, there should neither be administrative unification or administrative interference in matters between local churches, but there should be the fellowship, mutual help in spiritual matters, and the leading and following of one another in the truth.</p>
<p>A local church should maintain her administrative independence as well as keep the oneness of the fellowship. The administration of a church is local and thus independent; the fellowship of the church is the fellowship of the Body and thus is one. On the one hand, a local church should not lose her local independence in administration, and on the other hand, she should not lose the oneness of the Body in her fellowship. If a local church loses its administrative independence, it will lose its local character. If a local church loses the oneness of its fellowship, it will become a local sect. A local church must not lose its local character nor become a local sect. Therefore, it must preserve the independence of its administration and the oneness of its fellowship. Preserving the local independence of administration as well as the oneness of the fellowship in the Body is the normal condition of a local church. A local church should preserve the independence of its local administration and preserve the oneness of the fellowship of the Body with other local churches.</p><h2 class="head3">In One Accord</h2>
<p>Since the local churches are the Body of Christ, their actions should be in one accord for the sake of God&rsquo;s testimony and the Lord&rsquo;s work even though their administration is local. When Paul wrote the Epistle to the church in Corinth, he also addressed it to all those who call upon the name of the Lord (1 Cor. 1:2), and when he commanded the church in one locality to do something, he gave the same command to the other local churches (7:17; 16:1). Additionally, the practices of a local church are held by all the local churches (11:16; 14:34), and a local church should imitate the testimony of all the churches of God (1 Thes. 2:14). Furthermore, the word that the Holy Spirit speaks to one local church is addressed to all the local churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22).</p>
<p>The Bible shows that the God-ordained arrangement of the church is marvelous, spiritual, and simple. God appoints apostles and sends them out to establish churches. Then He works through the apostles to appoint elders for administration and deacons for service in the local churches that have been established. At the same time, He raises up prophets in the local churches to reveal His will and to speak His truth for the strengthening and building up of the saints in the localities. He also raises up evangelists in the local churches in order to bring sinners into the church as material for the increase and spread of the church. He raises up shepherds and teachers to shepherd and teach, using the word of God to cultivate and water the saved ones in every locality. These arrangements are very thorough, satisfactory, spontaneous, simple, practical, and flexible. Each local church is independent in its administration and universal in its fellowship, and each local church moves in one accord with other local churches. This arrangement is so free, yet there is no division or confusion. This is entirely unlike the organization carried out according to man&rsquo;s will in Christianity today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SERVICE OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">All Being Priests</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Made us...priests to His God&rdquo;; &ldquo;You are a...priesthood&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:6; 1 Pet. 2:9; see also Rev. 5:9-10).</p>
<p>The church is constituted with all who are redeemed by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, and those who are redeemed by the Lord&rsquo;s blood have been saved to serve Him. The service of the believers is the service of the church to God. In the service of the church all members serve as priests; all believers serve God equally. This is different from the service of the Israelites in the Old Testament in which only one tribe served as priests, whereas most of the people could not serve God. In this way a small number of priests became a mediatorial class between the majority of the people and God. But in the New Testament service of the church, there is no mediatorial class; all believers are priests, and all can serve God equally. There is no differentiation based on the concept of clergy and laity. The priestly system in Roman Catholicism, the ministerial system in Protestantism, and the pastoral system in independent Protestant churches today violate the principle of all believers being priests. These systems destroy the reality of God receiving service from all the members and are against the teaching of the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Coordinated Service of the Body</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Just as in one body we have many members, and all the members do not have the same function, so we who are many are one Body in Christ, and individually members one of another...Whether prophecy...or service...or he who teaches...or he who exhorts...Be burning in spirit, serving the Lord&rdquo;; &ldquo;Out from whom all the Body, being joined together and being knit together through every joint of the rich supply and through the operation in the measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:4-8, 11; Eph. 4:16; see also 1 Cor. 12:12-27).</p>
<p>The service of the church is not merely service from every member but a service of the Body. The service of the Body is a coordinated service. It is not simply a matter of all the believers serving but of serving in coordination. Although everyone serves, no one serves individually; all are coordinated together in service. Each one who serves is a member, not the Body; therefore, all the members must coordinate together. Every member has a function, but each member must be coordinated in the Body for this function to be exercised. Therefore, a member cannot be individualistic; every member must be coordinated with the other members of the Body so that they can serve effectively according to their ministries, or functions. Whenever a believer is individualistic in his service, the service of the church is damaged. It is not enough for each individual believer to serve; all the members must be connected together and mutually coordinated for the service of the Body to come forth.</p>
<p>The service of the church is a universal service. It is not a service of a few individuals but the coordinated service of the Body. Although there are gifts who have a particular portion in the building up of the church, they do not replace the saints in their service to God. They only perfect the saints so that all may serve God. Moreover, they are coordinated with all the saints in their service to God (vv. 28-30). Although there are some who bear particular responsibilities in the administration of a local church, they do not replace the saints in their service to God. They lead the saints and are coordinated together with them in their service to God. Elders teach, make arrangements, and lead the brothers and sisters in service to God. Deacons help the brothers and sisters to serve God. It is not the responsibility of the elders and deacons to take care of all the service in the church. Most of the church service is carried out by the brothers and sisters. All the brothers and sisters, including the elders and deacons, must carry out their functions according to their ministry. Those who serve more should do so out of their spiritual capacity to bear more responsibility, and those whose function is manifested in one area should serve according to their capacity, but in all the service, there is no replacement of others and no killing of others&rsquo; functions. There is only the leading of the saints into service so that they would develop in function and serve in coordination.</p><h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Lord appointed the church to be His representative on earth, so He gave her great authority.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you retain, they are retained&rdquo;</strong> (John 20:23).</p>
<p>The authority given by the Lord to the church includes determining whether a person&rsquo;s sins have been forgiven or not. If a person does not believe in the Lord, he is a sinner and has no relationship with the kingdom of God. Once he repents and believes in the Lord, the church has the authority to determine whether his sins were forgiven and to receive him, confessing that he is one who has been forgiven and received by God. The church has been given this authority because she has received the Holy Spirit (v. 22). Therefore, the church can determine by the Holy Spirit whether a person&rsquo;s sins have been forgiven and whether he can be received. The Holy Spirit lets the church know whether a person&rsquo;s sins have been forgiven, whether God has received him, and whether the church can receive him. The church must exercise authority to receive people by the Holy Spirit. Without the Holy Spirit, the exercise of this authority would be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector...Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 18:17-18).</p>
<p>The Lord has given the church the authority to deal with sinning believers. If a brother sins, we should exhort him. If he will not listen, we should go with one or two other brothers to exhort him again. If he still does not listen, we should tell the matter to the church. If he will not listen to the church, the church has the authority to deal with him, bind him, and regard him as a Gentile. According to the verses immediately following this word in Matthew 18, the church&rsquo;s authority to deal with a sinning brother is in the Lord&rsquo;s name (v. 20). To be in the Lord&rsquo;s name means to be in the Lord. Therefore, the church does not deal with a sinning brother by herself but in the Lord and in His name. The Lord&rsquo;s name is the authority. To deal with someone in the Lord&rsquo;s name is to deal with him by the Lord&rsquo;s authority. If a local church is in a proper condition, she has this authority, and the Spirit of the Lord will confirm the church&rsquo;s dealing. Although the church does not have human, earthly authority of this age, she has spiritual, heavenly authority to cause unrepentant believers to lose the blessing of the church, lose the presence of the Lord, and to fall into darkness like worldly people who do not have the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Do you not judge those who are within the church?...Remove the evil man from among yourselves&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:12-13).</p>
<p>The Lord also gives the church the authority to judge and remove believers from the fellowship of the church. If some believers continuously commit the gross sins mentioned in 1 Corinthians 5 and if they refuse to repent, the church has the authority to condemn their sins and to remove them. This kind of removal is not for the purpose of rejection but in the hope of reconciliation.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?...Are you unworthy of the smallest judgments? Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention things of this life?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:2-3).</p>
<p>When the Lord comes again, the believers will have the authority to judge the world and the angels. Therefore, believers can judge disputes among brothers today. This authority has been given by the Lord to the church. The Lord does not want believers to take their disputes to unbelievers. The Lord wants the church to judge disputes among the brothers. Thus, the Lord gave the church the authority to judge.</p>
<p>The different kinds of authority that the Lord has given the church speak of the importance of the church in the Lord&rsquo;s eyes. The church is very important.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEETINGS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>See chapter 30, entitled &ldquo;Meeting,&rdquo; in <em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</em>, vol. 3.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Lord treasures the church and desires to obtain the church; Satan envies the church and desires to damage the church. The Lord builds up the church, but Satan tears down the church. The church that the Lord created on the cross and brought forth on Pentecost was spiritual and heavenly, overcoming sin and the world, and was holy and without blemish. However, she quickly became corrupted and desolate because of Satan&rsquo;s damaging work. Not long after the church began, Satan mixed false believers, tares, into the church (Matt. 13:25) so that the church became mixed and impure. At the same time, he worked in the church to cause people to deceive the Holy Spirit (Acts 5:1-11), to murmur concerning their physical needs (6:1), and to covet glory in spiritual matters (8:18-24) in order to corrupt the intrinsic element of the church. At the time of the church in Corinth, he caused people to create divisions and become puffed up in their flesh (1 Cor. 1:10-13; 3:1-5; 4:6-8), to commit adultery in wanton lust (ch. 5), to sue each other (6:1-8), to willfully eat meat that had been sacrificed to idols (ch. 8; 10:19-22), to doubt the authority of the apostle (9:1-15), to argue about head covering (11:2-16), to eat the Lord&rsquo;s supper improperly (vv. 17-34), to confuse the order in the church by the abuse of the spiritual gifts and the lack of love (chs. 12&mdash;14), to not believe in the future resurrection of the dead (15:12-19), and to be dissimilarly yoked with unbelievers (2 Cor. 6:14-18). Satan also worked to bring the church back under the law of Judaism, including the practice of circumcision (Gal. 2:4, 11-19; 3:1-5; 4:21; 5:1-12; 6:12-15), so that she would lose the New Testament grace of life, the power of the gospel, and the purity in the Holy Spirit. Satan also brought Gentile philosophy into the church (Col. 2:8, 20-23) so that the element of human thought and philosophical reasoning would be mixed into the church. By the time Paul wrote the Epistles to Timothy, Satan&rsquo;s corruption of the church was even stronger. He caused people to thrust away a good conscience and to blaspheme (1 Tim. 1:19-20), to do evil things to the apostle (2 Tim. 4:14-15), and to overthrow the faith of many by saying that the resurrection had already taken place (2:17-18). Satan did this in order to cause people to depart from the faith, to give heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons (1 Tim. 4:1-3; 6:20-21), and to teach heresies and to regard godliness as a means for gain (vv. 3-5). This made people lovers of self, lovers of money, and lovers of pleasure, having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power (2 Tim. 3:1-8). It caused the servants of the Lord to love the present age and to leave their co-workers (4:10). Furthermore, it caused the churches to turn away from the apostles (1:15; 4:16), which means to leave the teaching and fellowship of the apostles. By the time Peter wrote his second Epistle and Jude wrote his Epistle, Satan had caused the church to have false teachers who brought in destructive heresies and even denied the Master who bought them in order to cause the people to follow the way of Balaam, which is to love the wages of unrighteousness (2 Pet. 2:1-3, 15; Jude 11). By the time John wrote his Epistles, Satan had caused antichrists to appear in the church who did not believe that the Lord was God incarnate and who went beyond the teaching concerning the person of the Lord to teach heresies that are reflected in today&rsquo;s modern schools of unbelieving theology (1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7-11). He had also caused those in the church to love to be first, to babble evil words against the apostles, to rampantly defy authority, to do evil, and to deal with the brothers as they pleased (3 John 9-11). By the time of the Lord&rsquo;s last seven epistles (about A.D. 90), not only had some of the churches left their first love toward the Lord (Rev. 2:4), but some also dwelt where the throne of Satan is and held the teachings of Balaam and the Nicolaitans (vv. 13-15). There were churches who held the teaching of Jezebel, committed adultery, ate idol sacrifices, and knew the deep things of Satan (vv. 20-24). There were churches who had a name that they were living but were dead and weak in all things (3:1-2). There were also churches who were lukewarm and self-satisfied to the extent that the Lord was completely shut out (vv. 15-17, 20). Since the church was corrupt and desolate, she could not satisfy the Lord&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire, and the Lord was forced to call out some to do what the church was incapable of doing. Therefore, the Lord sent forth a call for believers to be overcomers (2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The man-child that the woman brings forth in Revelation 12 is the overcomers whom the Lord gains in the church. They carry out the church&rsquo;s function to deal with and defeat God&rsquo;s enemy Satan to bring in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>The corruption and degradation of the church on earth has never ceased. In the first part of the fourth century, the Roman emperor Constantine accepted Christianity and made it the official religion of his worldly empire. This caused the church to be wholly joined to the world. She lost her nature of being separated from the world and was instead joined to the world. The Lord referred to this matter in the parable of the mustard seed in Matthew 13 and in the epistle to the church in Pergamos in Revelation 2. In the sixth century the Roman Catholic Church was officially established, causing the church to become inwardly filled with all kinds of heresies and evils and to lose her pure spiritual nature. The Lord spoke of this matter in the parable of the leaven in Matthew 13 and in the epistle to the church in Thyatira in Revelation 2. Today the &ldquo;church&rdquo; is in a condition of corruption and degradation such as has never been seen before. According to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s prophecy, the corruption and degradation of the church will continue until the day the Lord returns; only then will it cease.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MATURITY OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:13).</p>
<p>The Bible shows that even though there is degradation in the church on earth, the church is also growing unto maturity. The church will arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. There is desolation because of Satan&rsquo;s corruption; there is growth because of God&rsquo;s operation. No matter how much Satan corrupts the church, God continuously operates to cause the church to grow unto full maturity. The past two thousand years of church history is a history of both desolation and growth. Today the church is more desolate than ever, but she is also more mature than ever. Outwardly, the church is more desolate, but inwardly, the church is more mature. In its initial stage at the time of the apostles, the church attained to a high peak, but this temporary attainment did not constitute maturity, so what was gained was quickly lost. After nearly two thousand years of God&rsquo;s operation, however, many of the things that were lost have been recovered and solidly constituted into the church to the extent that it would be difficult to lose them again. For example, justification by faith was obtained by the church in the beginning but was lost until its recovery at the time of Luther. Now it has been worked into the church to such an extent that it would be hard to lose it again. God continues to work in this way to cause the church to grow until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God. We are in the process of being headed up in Him, becoming full-grown and attaining to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:26-27).</p>
<p>From the time the Lord obtained the church by giving Himself up for her, He has been continuously working to make the church glorious, holy, and without blemish. The Lord continuously uses the water of life in His living word to wash away the wrinkles of this age and the spots of the old creation in the church to make her a glorious church, completely holy and without any blemish. He washes away the old things of Adam from the church and fills her with His element and glory until she is just like Him. This is what the Lord can and will eventually accomplish in the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband&rdquo;; &ldquo;Having the glory of God. Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal&rdquo;; &ldquo;And the city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb. And the nations will walk by its light; and the kings of the earth bring their glory into it&rdquo;; &ldquo;A river of water of life...proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life...And the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and His slaves will serve Him...and they will reign forever and ever&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:2, 11, 23-24; 22:1-3, 5).</p>
<p>All the conditions manifested at the appearing of the New Jerusalem are the final result of the church. The New Jerusalem manifests that God in Christ the Lamb is wholly united with His redeemed from all ages to be one entity, completely mingled with them as their life and content and taking them as His dwelling and expression. Inwardly, the church will be completely filled with His life and light; outwardly, the church will bear His full image, expressing His glory to shine on the nations in the new earth. The church will serve God and Christ the Lamb as priests and will exercise authority for God as kings. This is the result of the church!</p>
<h2 class="head1">TEN GOLDEN PRINCIPLES CONCERNING THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>1. The church is Christ; anything that is not Christ is not the church.</p>
<p>2. The elimination of the element of Adam within the believers and the addition of the element of Christ is the church.</p>
<p>3. The entrance into the church is the cross; anyone who enters the church must be crucified.</p>
<p>4. The church is separated from the world; when the world is mixed with the church, the church ceases to be the church.</p>
<p>5. The church is a coordinated Body; individualism and individual actions dismember the Body.</p>
<p>6. The church is a three-dimensional Body; it is not flat.</p>
<p>7. The blessing of the church depends on the one accord; the one accord brings in the presence of God and manifests His blessing in the church.</p>
<p>8. The voice of the Holy Spirit is the one accord in the church.</p>
<p>9. The light of God is in the church, His Holy Place; the believers receive God&rsquo;s light in the church.</p>
<p>10. The cross, the church, and the kingdom are three major items in the New Testament; the cross produces the church, and the church brings in the kingdom.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-TWO</h1>

<li>Sinful angels.</li>
<li>Angels being judged.</li>
</ol>
<p>Angels are a big topic in the Bible. As we consider the crucial truths in the Bible, we cannot avoid studying this topic. We should know this topic because angels have a close relationship with the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God, who made heaven...and all things in them&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 14:15).</p>
<p>God is the Creator of heaven and all things in it. Heaven and everything in it were created by God. Since angels are in heaven, they were created by God. They exist because they were created by God. God&rsquo;s creation is the origin of angels.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NATURE OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Are they not all ministering spirits?&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:14).</p>
<p>Angels are spirits, so their nature is spiritual. Their nature is different from physical things. Our physical eyes cannot see them, and our physical senses cannot sense them.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;They neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 22:30).</p>
<p>Angels are spirits, so they do not have differences in gender and thus are not involved in matters such as marriage like humans who have physical bodies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OTHER NAMES FOR ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The sons of God&rdquo;</strong> (Job 1:6; 2:1).</p>
<p>Angels are called the sons of God because they were created by God. Although they were not born of God and do not have the life of God, they were created by Him, and God is their source. Therefore, they are called the sons of God, just as Adam was called the son of God because he was created by God (Luke 3:38), even though Adam was neither born of God nor had the life of God. The status of angels is different from the status of regenerated believers, who are the children of God. Believers are born of God and have the life of God. Angels were created by God but do not have God&rsquo;s life. Even though angels do not have God&rsquo;s life, they are still from God and thus can be called sons of God. The Bible considers all who are from God to be sons of God, regardless of whether they were created by God or are born of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The host of heaven&rdquo;</strong> (1 Kings 22:19).</p>
<p>In the Bible the angels are called the host of heaven because they are God&rsquo;s heavenly army. As God&rsquo;s army, they fight for God against the enemy (2 Kings 6:14-18; Dan. 10:18, 20-21; 12:1; Rev. 12:7; Matt. 26:53; John 18:36). This army of angels is in the heavens and is exceedingly numerous; therefore, the angels are called the host of heaven.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NUMBER OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 5:11; see also Heb. 12:22; Dan. 7:10).</p>
<p>The Bible says that the number of angels is ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands. This is a number that we cannot count. We know that the universe is very large. Just the angels alone, whom we cannot see, number ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands. There are so many that we have no way to count them! There are so many angels because in this immense universe there are many matters that require their attention.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POSITION OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;What is mortal man...? / You have made Him a little lower than angels&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 8:4-5).</p>
<p>In this verse the psalmist says that God made man a little lower than the angels. According to the context of this portion, this speaks of the order in God&rsquo;s creation. In the order of God&rsquo;s creation, angels are higher than man, and men are lower than angels. Therefore, even the Lord Jesus in His incarnation was lower than the angels with respect to His humanity (Heb. 2:9). But in God&rsquo;s salvation we are children of God, whereas angels are servants of God and serve us (1:14); therefore, we are greater than the angels.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DUTY OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Ministered to Him...stood before Him&rdquo;</strong> (Dan. 7:10; see also 1 Kings 22:19).</p>
<p>It is the duty of angels to minister to God; therefore, they always stand before Him. God does many things in the universe through angels. Apart from His salvation and His gospel, God carries out most of the affairs of the universe through angels. God accomplished His salvation through His Son, and God preaches His gospel through His children. God carries out almost every other matter in the universe through angels.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Angels...are greater in strength and power&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 2:11; see also Rev. 5:2; 18:21).</p>
<p>The power and strength of angels are very great. Many portions in the Bible tell us this fact. We cannot know exactly how great is the power and strength of the angels, but they have enough power to do whatever God wants them to do, no matter how much power it requires. If they did not, they would be unable to carry out their commission from God to do many things in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANGELS AND SAINTS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth for service for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:14).</p>
<p>Saints are children in God&rsquo;s household who inherit His salvation; angels are servants in God&rsquo;s household who serve the saints. They are ministering spirits, sent forth by God to serve those who inherit God&rsquo;s salvation in every matter.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The angel of Jehovah encamps / Around those who fear Him, and He delivers them&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 34:7).</p>
<p>When God sends angels to work for the saints, their principal job is to save and protect the saints. Here the psalmist says that the angel of Jehovah encamps around those who fear God and delivers them. In 2 Kings 19:35 an angel of Jehovah went out and killed a hundred and eighty-five thousand soldiers. The angels of Jehovah do not come only when we encounter difficulties; they encamp around us to deliver us. They are always encamped around us to protect and deliver us. It is as if we have our own personal bodyguards. Therefore, we who fear God should not worry, because in every situation we have angels encamped around us to protect us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;For He will give His angels charge concerning You / To keep You in all Your ways. / They will bear You up in their hands&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 91:11-12).</p>
<p>God charges His angels to protect us not only in one matter but in all our ways. They bear us up in their hands. This is something that we should believe as we follow the Lord. This should free us from anxiety in all our ways.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;It is his angel&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 12:15).</p>
<p>According to this verse Peter had &ldquo;his angel.&rdquo; This shows that every child of God has his angel. Although we do not see or feel the angels, we should believe that each one of us who have inherited God&rsquo;s salvation has an angel who serves and cares for us. We each have our own angel. Since we each have our own angel, the angel who protected Peter was called Peter&rsquo;s angel.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Their angels&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 18:10).</p>
<p>We may think that Peter had his own angel because he was an apostle, but in Matthew 18:10 the Lord said that each of the little ones who believed in Him had their angels and that these angels continually behold the face of the Father in heaven. Therefore, we should know and believe that each believer has an angel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANGELS NOT RECEIVING<br />
WORSHIP FROM MEN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I fell to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things. And he said to me, Do not do that! I am your fellow slave...Worship God!&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:8-9).</p>
<p>People may have the thought that angels should be worshipped since they are heavenly, spiritual, and much higher than earthly, fleshy men. We are not the only ones who have this thought; even the apostle John had this thought. He wanted to worship the angel who showed him the visions on the island of Patmos, but the angel said, &ldquo;Do not do that! I am your fellow slave...Worship God!&rdquo; The angel said that he should not be worshipped. This word was spoken very clearly and definitely, and it shows that the Roman Catholic Church&rsquo;s teaching concerning the worship of angels is heresy. The angels themselves say that we should not worship them but should worship only God. Although angels are spirits in heaven, who are continually before God&rsquo;s face and who protect and care for us, they are still creatures. They are not the Lord Creator. They are servants, not the Master, so they cannot receive worship from men. If angels receive worship from men, they usurp God&rsquo;s position, and if men worship angels, they blaspheme God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Let no one defraud you by judging you unworthy of your prize, in self-chosen lowliness and the worship of the angels&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:18).</p>
<p>In Colossians 2 the apostle Paul shows that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ in order to be received by us (vv. 9-10, 2-3). After we receive Christ, we should walk in Him, having been rooted and being built up in Him (vv. 6-7). If we hold on to Him, we will enjoy all the riches of the Godhead in Him and grow with the growth of God (v. 19). If we were to follow others to worship angels, we would leave Christ and lose the prize we obtained through faith in Him, which is all the riches of the Godhead. Because Christ is the mystery of God, the embodiment of God, and the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells, we should worship Him. Angels are merely the servants of God. Today they are inferior to us who inherit God&rsquo;s salvation, possess Christ, and are one with Him. To us, they are only ministering spirits, sent forth by God to serve us. For these reasons, how could we, who are one with our Head, Christ, the Lord of all, worship these ministering spirits? If we worship them, we lose the divine riches and the honor that we have obtained in Christ. This is truly inexcusable! It is a great error and sin for the Roman Catholic Church to teach people to worship angels. Since we possess Christ and have obtained all the riches of the Godhead in Him, we must not participate in such practices.</p><h2 class="head1">ARCHANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The archangel&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:16).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of the archangel and shows that there is a hierarchy among the angels. There are ordinary angels, and there are archangels. The word <em>archangel</em> is singular in the Greek. Since the Bible does not tell us, we do not know how many archangels there are.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Michael the archangel&rdquo;</strong> (Jude 9; see also Dan. 10:13, 21; 12:1; Rev. 12:7).</p>
<p>The Bible refers to an archangel named Michael, which means &ldquo;Who is like God?&rdquo; We do not know if the archangel in 1 Thessalonians 4 refers to Michael, but whenever the Bible mentions his name, it always speaks of his fighting or disputing with the devil or the devil&rsquo;s angels. Therefore, Michael must be the one who fights. Furthermore, the Bible clearly says that he is the great prince of Israel who protects the people of Israel. He also disputed with the devil over the body of Moses. This shows that Michael is the protector of God&rsquo;s people and that he fights for God&rsquo;s people against the devil and his angels. In the hierarchy of the angels, Michael was lower than the former archangel, the devil, because Jude 9 indicates that he dared not rebuke the devil but let the Lord rebuke him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GABRIEL</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The angel Gabriel&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 1:26, see also v. 19; Dan. 8:16; 9:21).</p>
<p>The Bible also mentions an angel (but never calls him an archangel) named Gabriel, which means &ldquo;mighty man of God.&rdquo; Every time the Bible mentions Gabriel, he is bringing news to the people of God, and the news he brings is good. Therefore, he must be an angel who brings good news to the people of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHERUBIM</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The glory of the God of Israel went up from the cherub&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 9:3; see also ch. 10; 1:5-25; Gen. 3:24; 1 Kings 6:23-28).</p>
<p>The Bible also speaks of a group of God&rsquo;s angels called cherubim. They are especially close to God, and the glory of God is upon them. They are also called the cherubim of glory (Heb. 9:5); therefore, they are a group of angels who are especially related to God&rsquo;s glory. We can say that they are a symbol of God&rsquo;s glory. They manifest God&rsquo;s glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERAPHIM</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Seraphim...saying: / Holy, holy, holy, Jehovah of hosts&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 6:2-3).</p>
<p>The Bible also speaks of another group of angels called seraphim, which means &ldquo;burning.&rdquo; When the Bible speaks of them, it particularly mentions God&rsquo;s holiness. They are before God, crying to one another, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy.&rdquo; Therefore, they are a group of angels especially related to God&rsquo;s holiness. They manifest God&rsquo;s holiness. The seraphim and the cherubim are two groups of angels before God. The cherubim are related to God&rsquo;s glory, and the seraphim are related to God&rsquo;s holiness. As the cherubim manifest God&rsquo;s glory, the seraphim manifest God&rsquo;s holiness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR LIVING CREATURES</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;This was the living creature that I had seen beneath the God of Israel...They were cherubim&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 10:20, see also v. 15; 1:5-25).</p>
<p>The Bible also speaks of another group of angels before God called the four living creatures. The four living creatures in Ezekiel are cherubim. They are especially related to God&rsquo;s glory, which is manifested upon them.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The first living creature was like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature had a face like that of a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings apiece, are full of eyes around and within; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God the Almighty&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 4:7-8; see also Ezek. 1:10; 10:14; Isa. 6:2-3).</p>
<p>In Revelation there is reference to the living creatures, but there is a difference between this and what is spoken of them in Ezekiel. Ezekiel mentions only cherubim, but Revelation mentions both cherubim and seraphim. In Revelation the four living creatures have not only the four faces of the cherubim but also the six wings of the seraphim; moreover, like the seraphim, they stand before God crying, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy.&rdquo; This means that the four living creatures in Ezekiel are for God&rsquo;s glory, whereas the four living creatures in Revelation are for both God&rsquo;s glory and God&rsquo;s holiness. They have the cherubic function of glory and the seraphic function of holiness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SINFUL ANGELS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God did not spare the angels who sinned but delivered them to gloomy pits, having cast them down to Tartarus, they being kept for judgment&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 2:4; see also Jude 6).</p>
<p>Some of the angels sinned. They did not remain in their position but sinned and offended God. God&rsquo;s righteousness could not spare them. Therefore, God cast them into gloomy pits where they wait for judgment.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;His tail drags away the third part of the stars of heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:4).</p>
<p>The great red dragon mentioned in verse 3 is the devil. His tail dragged away one-third of the stars of heaven. The stars of heaven refer to the angels (1:20). Thus, this verse refers to the devil dragging away one-third of the angels in heaven. This third part of the angels must be the sinful angels who followed the devil to rebel against God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;His angels&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7).</p>
<p>Because some of the angels followed the devil to sin and rebel against God, the Bible says that the devil has his angels. The devil&rsquo;s angels are evil spirits who help him tyrannize this dark world from the air. They are sinful angels.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANGELS BEING JUDGED</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The angels who sinned...being kept for judgment&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 2:4; see also Jude 6).</p>
<p>The sinful angels will be judged by God. All who oppose God, whether men or angels, will be judged by God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Do you not know that we will judge angels?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:3).</p>
<p>God will not judge the angels by Himself; He will let the believers judge them. God will let His children represent Him to judge the angels who rebelled against Him. This is a special authority that God gives to His children, and it is a shame to the sinful angels. God surely gives grace to His children. Today He gives us the right to enjoy being served by the angels, and in the future He will give us the authority to judge the sinful angels. Therefore, we should live and act in holiness and godliness &ldquo;for the sake of the angels&rdquo; (11:10)!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-THREE</h1>

</ol>
<p>God&rsquo;s enemy and our enemy is the devil. As God&rsquo;s enemy in the universe, the devil has opposed God throughout the ages and damaged His purpose. Therefore, there are many portions in the Bible that speak of the devil. Many of his works are targeted at the believers; consequently, we must be clear concerning him. The following points briefly outline these matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS ORIGIN</h2>
<p>It is common for many to wonder about the existence and origin of the devil. The Word of God is not silent concerning this matter.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You who sealed up perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty...You were the anointed cherub who covered the Ark; indeed I set you, so that you were upon the holy mountain of God...You were perfect in your ways from the day that you were created, until unrighteousness was found in you...Your heart was lifted up because of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom by reason of your brightness&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 28:12, 14-15, 17).</p>
<p>The devil was a cherub created by God, and he sealed up perfection, was full of wisdom, and was perfect in beauty. God anointed him and set him upon His holy mountain, which is God&rsquo;s dwelling place in heaven, to cover the Ark of God. The devil&rsquo;s position before God was high, and he was very close to God. The above verses in Ezekiel can be compared to Ephesians 2:2, Jude 9, Luke 4:5-6, and John 12:31. The devil must have been the highest archangel established by God, and God must have especially relied upon him. He was perfect in his ways when he was created, but later his heart was lifted up because of his beauty. Then he committed unrighteousness, corrupting the wisdom that God had given him. He was proud of his beauty, and by means of his brightness, he used his God-given wisdom to sin and commit unrighteousness. This archangel, whom God relied upon in the beginning and who sinned because of pride, is more than a person on earth or an angel in heaven; he is the devil who is proud, sinful, and rebellious against God.</p>
<p>The devil was originally a perfect cherub and an honored archangel, but he became proud because of his superior beauty and because of the honored position that God had given him. Then he used his God-given wisdom to sin and rebel against God. He corrupted himself, making himself into the author of evil and becoming something evil, the devil.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;O Daystar, son of the dawn!... / You said in your heart: / I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 14:12-14).</p>
<p>This portion, which speaks of the Daystar, the son of the dawn, involves a type. A star refers to an angel (Rev. 1:20), and <em>Daystar</em> refers to a bright angel. <em>Son of the dawn</em> refers to the morning of the universe, which means the beginning of the universe. The son is not the source, unlike the father, but comes from the father; therefore, this son, who came from God, is an angel created by God. Therefore, these verses speak of a bright angel who was created by God at the beginning of the universe. At a certain point in time this bright angel became proud in his heart, and said &ldquo;I will&rdquo; five times. First, he said &ldquo;I will ascend to heaven&rdquo; to the place where God dwells. Second, he said &ldquo;Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne&rdquo; in order to be above and superior to all God&rsquo;s angels. Third, he said, &ldquo;I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north.&rdquo; The northernmost place is where God and His angels meet (1 Kings 22:19-23; Job 1:6; 2:1). It is the dwelling place of God. There the angels of God stand in waiting before Him; only God Himself sits upon the throne. But this proud angel wanted to sit on the throne. This means that he wanted to usurp God&rsquo;s place on the throne. Fourth, he said, &ldquo;I will ascend above the heights of the clouds,&rdquo; which are above the heavens. He wanted to be in a place higher than the heavens (Heb. 7:26), which is the third heaven where God dwells (2 Cor. 12:2). Fifth, he said, &ldquo;I will make myself like the Most High,&rdquo; which means that he wanted to be equal with God. Here he clearly reveals what was in his arrogant and proud heart. He wanted to uplift himself to be equal with God. This is a great blasphemy. A creature dared to make himself equal to the Lord Creator. He wanted to uplift his throne to compete with the throne of God. This is the greatest blasphemy. It is the vainest of imaginations. This blasphemous, foolish angel is more than simply a man on earth or an angel in heaven. This proud and evil one, who constantly plots to usurp God&rsquo;s place, is the devil. His heart became proud because of the beauty and glory that God had given him. He wanted to uplift himself to be equal with God, and so he rebelled against God. His rebellion against God caused him (an angel who used to stand in waiting before God) to become God&rsquo;s enemy, Satan. It caused him to change from a star of brightness into the king of darkness. It changed him from the son of the dawn into the father of eternal night.</p>
<p>God did not create the devil. God created a bright, beautiful, wise, perfect, honorable, and glorious archangel who because of his pride became the devil through his rebellion against God. God did not create an evil one, nor is He the Author of evil. The evil in the universe was created by this perfect, beautiful creature of God. This perfect, beautiful creature of God is the origin of evil in the universe because of his proud, rebellious thoughts. He made himself into the evil one and became the universal source, the origination, of evil. The devil, Satan, is utterly evil.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS NATURE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The devil has sinned from the beginning&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:8).</p>
<p>The devil has sinned from the beginning, so his nature and essence are sin. The sins that he committed in the beginning were thinking of himself, including his own beauty, glory, and honor; becoming proud by thinking of himself; wanting to uplift himself because of his pride; and rebelling against God and wanting to usurp God&rsquo;s position as the Most High because of his desire to uplift himself. His words <em>I will</em> were spoken entirely out of himself, according to his will, and completely denied God&rsquo;s authority. This is the principle of his sin. Even today he is working to incite men to sin according to this principle. He is operating according to this principle to cause people to sin in the same way that he sinned in the beginning. He causes men to become proud in their thoughts concerning themselves so that they will usurp and deny God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He is a liar&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:44).</p>
<p>The devil is a liar by nature; therefore, lying is part of his nature and essence. Lying involves falsehood, so his nature involves falsehood. Everything that he says and does is designed to cheat people. Even if he speaks of matters related to the truth, his false intentions make his speaking a lie. Even if he does something that seems right, his false intentions make his actions a lie. He speaks lies out of himself and out of his nature. He is the father of all liars; he is the source of all who lie and are false. All lying and falsehood come from him (Matt. 5:37).</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;He was a murderer from the beginning&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:44).</p>
<p>The devil was a murderer from the beginning. Murder is part of his nature and essence. All the murder and hate throughout the history of the human race come from this evil one whose nature is murder.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS NAMES</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The great dragon&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:9).</p>
<p>There are many names for the devil in the Bible, and all his names are meaningful. All the names for the devil in the Bible reveal something about him. The most frightening of his names is the great dragon. This name shows that he is cruel and vicious. He is a great dragon in the universe, cruel and vicious, putting fear into people.</p>
<p>The dragon is not only a name for the devil but also a symbol of him. The devil likes people to use his symbol on everything. In idol temples there are dragons on many things. People all over the world and throughout all the ages have been attracted to dragons. Some get dragon tattoos or wear dragons on their clothes. Some have dragons on the implements in their homes. It seems as if there is almost no place without the symbol of a dragon. The devil likes this practice, but believers should have no part in it.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The ancient serpent&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:9).</p>
<p>In the Bible the name of the great dragon is paired with the name of the ancient serpent. This name shows that he is devious and crafty. The Bible says that the serpent was the most crafty of all the creatures (Gen. 3:1). In the beginning the serpent was very beautiful to look at. When the devil came to tempt Eve, he came in the form of a serpent. Today the devil still comes in the form of people or things that are like serpents in principle. He uses them to tempt and trap people. He is an ancient serpent who is devious, crafty, and difficult to withstand.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Devil&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:2).</p>
<p>The Bible often calls the devil, the Devil. This is his true name. The meaning of this name in the original Greek language is &ldquo;accuser,&rdquo; or &ldquo;slanderer,&rdquo; and it speaks of his character and actions. He is always accusing us before God and encouraging us to blaspheme God. Sometimes the devil carries out his accusation and slander from within us, and sometimes he uses the people around us. His name truly reflects what he is&mdash;an accuser and a slanderer of God and man.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Satan&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:2).</p>
<p>The Bible also calls the devil Satan. Satan means &ldquo;adversary.&rdquo; The devil is God&rsquo;s adversary. From the day he rebelled, he has opposed God in everything in the universe. God will completely deal with him in the future. Even within us, he influences us to oppose God. Any inward opposition or rebellion toward God within us is the result of Satan&rsquo;s operation in us.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The ruler of this world&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:31; 16:11; see also 14:30).</p>
<p>The Bible also calls the devil the ruler of this world because the devil is the leader of the rulers of the world today (Eph. 6:12; 2:2). The world today is completely under the devil&rsquo;s control; it is dark and evil. The devil is the ruler of this dark and evil world.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The god of this age&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>The Bible also calls the devil the god of this age because in this age the devil receives worship and service from man. <em>The ruler of this world</em> refers to his control over people; <em>the god of this age</em> refers to the worship that he receives from people. In this age he hides behind idols and things to receive worship and service from people. Every idol worshipper is worshipping and serving the devil behind the idol.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The evil one&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:12; 5:19).</p>
<p>The Bible calls the devil the evil one because he is evil. The devil is evil; he is the evil one in the universe. Therefore, his designation as the evil one truly fits him.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;He is a liar and the father of it&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:44).</p>
<p>The devil is called the father of lies because all lies come from him. Every liar is his child (1 John 3:10).</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;The tempter&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 4:3).</p>
<p>The devil tempts people in all things. Therefore, the Bible calls him the tempter.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;The ruler of the authority of the air&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2).</p>
<p>This dark world today is ruled by a group of evil spirits in the air (6:12), and the devil is their ruler. Therefore, the Bible calls him the ruler of the authority of the air.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Beelzebul, ruler of the demons&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 12:24).</p>
<p>The devil is called ruler of the demons because he rules over all the demons. The Bible calls him Beelzebul, which means &ldquo;the lord of the dunghill.&rdquo; This name contains a contemptuous reference to Beelzebub, or Baal-zebub, the god of the Ekronites (2 Kings 1:2), which means &ldquo;the lord of flies.&rdquo; This tells us that demons are dirty and unclean. The demons under his rule are like a dunghill and flies. Both a dunghill and flies are filthy. This is the nature of the demons who are under the devil. The devil is their filthy ruler.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Adversary&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 5:8; see also Matt. 13:28, 39).</p>
<p>The devil is God&rsquo;s enemy and always fights against God&rsquo;s children, so the Bible calls him the adversary.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Belial&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 6:15).</p>
<p>Belial is another name for the devil in the Bible. Belial means &ldquo;worthless, filthy, and lawless.&rdquo; These adjectives describe the condition of the devil, which is the exact opposite of the honorable, holy, and lawful condition of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS AUTHORITY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All the kingdoms of the inhabited earth...To You I will give all this authority and their glory, because to me it has been delivered, and to whomever I want I give it&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 4:5-6).</p>
<p>The devil spoke these tempting words to the Lord in Luke 4:5-6, and they show that his authority in the universe is very great. He said that all the authority and glory of all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth had been delivered to him and that he could give it to whomever he wanted. When the Lord heard this, He did not deny the devil&rsquo;s words; therefore, what the devil spoke was factual. God must have delivered this authority and glory to him before he fell because only God has the authority in the universe to do this. This corresponds with the fact that the devil was the highest archangel appointed by God. Thus, in the beginning God delivered all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth to him so that he would rule over them for God. The authority that God appointed to him in the universe is very great. He is above all other creatures and is inferior only to God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The ruler of this world&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:31).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus called the devil the ruler of this world when He spoke of him in relation to the world. The devil is the ruler of this world because all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth were delivered to him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The ruler of the authority of the air&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, God originally wanted the devil to rule over the kingdoms of the inhabited earth; consequently, God appointed other angels to be under him as his assistants to help him govern and exercise authority in the air. The devil became the ruler of these authorities in the air; therefore, his authority is higher than that of the other angels.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Michael the archangel, when he contended with the devil...did not dare to bring a reviling judgment against him but said, The Lord rebuke you&rdquo;</strong> (Jude 9).</p>
<p>This verse shows that the devil&rsquo;s position before God is very high because even Michael, an archangel, did not dare to bring reviling judgment against him. Rather, Michael kept the order ordained by God. He could only say, &ldquo;The Lord rebuke you.&rdquo; The fact that Michael, an archangel in a very high position, did not dare to revile the devil proves that the devil&rsquo;s position is higher than that of the archangels. Furthermore, according to Michael&rsquo;s word, only God could rebuke him. This proves that only God Himself is above the devil and that all the angels and creatures are under him. Other than God, no one has the position to rebuke him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS KINGDOM</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Satan...his kingdom&rdquo;; &ldquo;The authority of Satan&rdquo;; &ldquo;The authority of darkness&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 12:26; Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>Satan has a kingdom. He was appointed by God to rule the world in the beginning, but he established his own kingdom when he rebelled against God in order to usurp God&rsquo;s authority. His kingdom is his authority. His authority is called the authority of darkness because it is filled with his darkness and evil. His kingdom of darkness, his authority of darkness, opposes the kingdom of God, which is also the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The authority of the air&rdquo;; &ldquo;The ruler of this world&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2; John 12:31).</p>
<p>The realm in which Satan exercises his authority is in the air and on the earth, the world. These are the boundaries of his kingdom, and these boundaries limit the ability of the authority of God to freely operate to accomplish God&rsquo;s will. This is the reason that Daniel&rsquo;s prayer was withstood for twenty-one days by one of the princes of Satan&rsquo;s kingdom in the air (Dan. 10:12-13). This is also the reason that the Lord wants us to pray for the kingdom of God, which is His authority, to come and for His will to be done on earth as it is in the heavens. In the future, when Satan is thrown from the air to the earth (Rev. 12:8-9) and then from the earth into the abyss (20:2-3), his authority will be completely swept from the air and the earth, and the kingdom of God and the authority of Christ will come to the earth (12:10). Then the earth will become the kingdom of God and of Christ (11:15), and God&rsquo;s authority will be done on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS SUBORDINATES</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:12).</p>
<p>The devil also has subordinates because he is the ruler of the authorities in the air and the ruler of the world. The first group of subordinates are the angels God originally appointed to be under him to help him rule the earth. Many of these angels followed him in his rebellion against God, and they are now the rulers and authorities in the air. They are the world-rulers of this darkness and the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. As his officials and ministers, they are higher in his kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The prince&rdquo;</strong> (Dan. 10:13, 20).</p>
<p>As the devil&rsquo;s subordinates, the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies, the world-rulers of this darkness, govern individual nations. The Bible calls the evil angels who rule over each country evil princes. They help the devil rule this world. The devil is like a Caesar, and they are like tetrarchs under him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The host on high&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 24:21).</p>
<p>The devil also has an army made up of the angels who followed him in his rebellion. <em>The host on high</em> in Isaiah 24:21 refers to the devil&rsquo;s army in the air because it is contrasted with <em>the kings of the earth</em> in the same verse.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;His angels&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:41; Rev. 12:7, 9).</p>
<p>In the preceding chapter we studied angels, and we saw that one-third of the angels followed the devil. The angels who followed him became his subordinate angels. Therefore, he has his many angels.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Evil spirits...demons&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 8:2).</p>
<p>Demons, or evil spirits, who are often mentioned in the four Gospels, are another group of the devil&rsquo;s subordinates. Demons, or evil spirits, are different from the angels who followed the devil. Angels are in the air, but demons are on the earth. They must have been the earthly population that was under the devil in the preadamic world. They were living creatures who followed the devil in his rebellion against God and who were judged by God by floods of water and became disembodied spirits living in the sea (Matt. 8:32). They work on the earth to inflict pain on people and to possess human bodies (12:43-45). The angels who followed the devil became his angels in the air, and the demons, the disembodied spirits, became his servants on earth.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;His ministers&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 11:15, see also vv. 13-14).</p>
<p>Another group of the devil&rsquo;s subordinates are his ministers. This group consists of false apostles, or false workers who pervert the word of the truth and damage the Lord&rsquo;s work. In addition to angels in the air and demons on the earth, this group of people serve as his ministers within Christianity. These false apostles work for the devil to damage God&rsquo;s work.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS PEOPLE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The whole world lies in the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:19).</p>
<p>All the people in the world today lie in the evil one and are subject to his ruling.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who practices sin is of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:8).</p>
<p>Everyone who practices sin is of the devil and part of his people.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Children of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:10; see also John 8:44; Matt. 23:33).</p>
<p>All sinners are children of the devil; they have his life and spontaneously are his people. With the exception of the believers, he has all the people in the world. His kingdom is large, impressive, and powerful. It is really something for him to boast of.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS RELIGION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The god of this age&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>In addition to his kingdom, the devil has his own religion. He is not merely the ruler of this world but also the god of this age. He not only governs worldly people but also receives their worship. Man was created to worship God; therefore, he cannot avoid worshipping something. If man does not worship the true God, he will worship a false god. Man worships with gods and worships without gods, he worships with old forms and new forms of worship. Any worship that is not directed toward God, regardless of the object of its worship, is worship that is directed toward the devil. As the god of this age, any worship that is not being given to God is being given to the devil. God can obtain man&rsquo;s worship only when man worships Him in spirit through the Lord Jesus, but the devil can obtain man&rsquo;s worship in many ways. He does not care about the manner or method of man&rsquo;s worship as long as he obtains it.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Fall down and worship me&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 4:9).</p>
<p>The devil wants man to worship him. He uses fame and power to tempt man to worship him. He even tried to tempt the Lord Jesus in this way, but the Lord Jesus was not tempted. So many people in this world have been drawn to worship the devil for the sake of fame and power. So many worship idols in order to gain fame, power, fortune, and tranquility. Even Catholics worship idols in their cathedrals in order to gain fortune and tranquility.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Worship the demons and the idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 9:20).</p>
<p>There are demons behind every idol, even the so-called statues of Jesus in Catholicism. Every place that promotes the worship of idols, whether a temple, a chapel, or a home, is dark. The devil receives man&rsquo;s worship through the demons behind the idols.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;What is sacrificed to an idol...Sacrifice to demons&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:19-20).</p>
<p>Idols are like puppets that are controlled by demons. Everything that is sacrificed to an idol is actually sacrificed to demons.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Have fellowship with demons&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 10:20).</p>
<p>The devil causes people to not only worship demons but also to contact demons and have fellowship with them. Contacting demons is common in many religions. The devil encourages people to contact demons, thereby making man one with him.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;A synagogue of Satan&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:9).</p>
<p>The verse refers to a Jewish synagogue. The devil used Judaism to confuse the church and to lead the believers astray by bringing them back to Judaism. Therefore, shortly after the church came into existence, even Jewish synagogues, which once were used for the worship of God, became synagogues of Satan.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Make one proselyte...you make him...a son of Gehenna&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 23:15).</p>
<p>The devil causes people to make proselytes of others so that they may enter Gehenna. Proselytizing people is not the work of God. Proselytizing people is the devil&rsquo;s work. Even in Christianity there are many sons of Gehenna who do the work of the devil and who serve him. The Roman Catholic Church is full of these kinds of people.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;An hour is coming for everyone who kills you to think that he is offering service to God&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:2).</p>
<p>The devil causes people to think that they are serving God by killing the genuine children of God. The devil used this strategy in the early days of the church. Many who were zealous for Judaism and the Old Testament law killed the people of the Lord, thinking that they were being zealous for God. The apostle Paul was such a person in the hand of the devil before he was saved. This kind of work was present not only in the early days of the church but also in the Roman Catholic and Protestant churches. The Roman Catholic Church has killed an untold number of true believers who worshipped the Lord and served Him, while thinking that it was safeguarding the truth of the Lord. John Huss, a precursor to the Reformation, was killed at the hands of Roman Catholicism. The author of <em>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress,</em> John Bunyan, also suffered under the hand of Protestantism. Today the devil is still working according to this principle. He does not cause people only to deny God; he also causes them to oppose God&rsquo;s will under the guise of serving God. This is one of the most devious and insidious religious works of the devil.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Self-imposed worship and lowliness&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:23).</p>
<p>If the devil cannot prevent people from worshipping God, he causes them to engage in self-imposed worship and lowliness. This is worship that is neither according to God&rsquo;s revelation nor of God through Christ in spirit. Instead, it is a worship that serves God according to worldly philosophy and self-imposed regulations through the efforts of the flesh. Any worship that is not according to God&rsquo;s Word, through Christ, and in the spirit is self-imposed worship. It is worship from the devil as a part of his religion.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 3:5).</p>
<p>In Christianity some have an outward form of godliness but deny its power. This false godliness is another component of the devil&rsquo;s religion.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;False apostles, deceitful workers, transfiguring themselves into apostles of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 11:13).</p>
<p>Sometimes the devil causes people to kill the apostles and those who work for the Lord in order to destroy the Lord&rsquo;s work. At other times the devil causes people to be false apostles who pretend to serve the Lord in order to bring in mixture to damage the Lord&rsquo;s work. Both of these aspects of his work are items in his religion.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;The deep things of Satan&rdquo;; &ldquo;Teachings of demons&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:24; 1 Tim. 4:1).</p>
<p>On the one hand, Satan causes people to oppose the Lord&rsquo;s truth, and on the other hand, he causes people to believe his teachings, his deep things. This is an aspect of his religion.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Preaches another Jesus...a different spirit...a different gospel&rdquo;; &ldquo;A different gospel&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 11:4; Gal. 1:6).</p>
<p>The devil has many tricks. When he cannot stop people from believing the gospel, believing into the Lord Jesus, and receiving the Holy Spirit, he causes people to preach a different gospel, another Jesus, to make people receive a different spirit. This is a trick of his religion. He can influence people to be false apostles. He can also cause people to speak false doctrines and preach a different gospel, another Jesus, so that they will receive a different spirit. His religion is truly kaleidoscopic and filled with many strange things. He is a rebel against God; he is God&rsquo;s enemy. He is also evil and devious, without morality or regulation. No amount of evil or deception is beneath him. In order to steal man&rsquo;s proper worship to God, to confuse and damage man&rsquo;s reasonable service to God, he will go to any extent and stop at nothing to reach his goal. He can create false religions in order to steal man&rsquo;s worship, and he can counterfeit Christianity to confuse worship that rightly belongs to God. He can invent regulations related to the worship of God, and he can counterfeit any kind of spiritual service. Invention and counterfeiting are his talents. He can assume a counterfeit identity of Jesus. He can counterfeit the works of the Holy Spirit. He can subvert the gospel with counterfeit truths. There is nothing he cannot counterfeit. As those who earnestly want to serve and please the Lord with a pure heart, we should be wary.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS ACTIONS IN THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>According to the record of the Bible, the devil has been involved in six actions in the universe from the beginning to the end.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rebelling Against God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You said in your heart: / I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 14:13-14).</p>
<p>The first action of the devil was to rebel against God because of his pride. The central point in his rebellion was his desire to elevate himself to compete with God as an equal and to be like God by taking His high place in the universe. The intention of all the devil&rsquo;s work among man is to cause man to elevate himself to oppose God. He causes man to foolishly desire to be like God, to be God, and to stand in the place of God. This is his consistent intention in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Spoiling the First Adam</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The serpent...said to the woman...For God knows that in the day you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was a delight to the eyes and that the tree was to be desired to make oneself wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 3:1, 5-6).</p>
<p>The devil&rsquo;s second action was to spoil the first Adam. God made the first Adam in order to deal with the devil and his rebellion. However, before Adam could deal with the devil, the devil came in and spoiled him. His method of spoiling man was to inject his thought of wanting to be like God into man. He seemed to say, &ldquo;God knows that in the day you eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, your eyes will be opened and you will become like God, knowing good and evil; therefore, He does not want you to eat of it.&rdquo; Once man was poisoned with this devilish thought, he rebelled against God, became corrupted, and fell into the devil&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Tempting the Last Adam</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jesus was...tempted by the devil...And the tempter came and said to Him, If You are the Son of God...He answered and said, It is written, &lsquo;Man shall not live...&rsquo; ...Go away, Satan!...Then the devil left Him&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 4:1, 3-4, 10-11).</p>
<p>Because the first man, the first Adam, who was created by God to deal with the devil, was spoiled by the devil, the Son of God, God incarnate, came as the last Adam to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy in man (1 Cor. 15:45; 1 John 3:8). The devil rebelled against God and attempted in vain to become God, but when God came to deal with the devil, He willingly became a man. God did not want to deal with His rebellious creature from His position as the Creator; He wanted to stand as a creature to deal with a rebellious creature. Therefore, God came in the position of a created man to deal with this rebellious, created angel. Thus, He is the last Adam. The devil came to tempt Christ as the last Adam because he wanted to spoil Him as well. This was the devil&rsquo;s third action. He was successful in his previous actions, but he was not successful in this attempt. The last Adam, Jesus Christ, could not be led astray. When the devil tempted the first Adam, he imparted his desire to be like God into man, but when he tempted the last Adam, he tried to lure Christ to leave His position as a man. He knew that the Son of God could deal with him only from the position of a man. He tempted the Lord by saying, &ldquo;If You are the Son of God,&rdquo; because he was trying to get Him to leave His position as a man and to hold on to His position as the Son of God. But the Lord answered, &ldquo;Man shall not live.&rdquo; In His answer, the Lord was saying, &ldquo;I am a man; I cannot leave My position as a man. I am standing in the position of a man to deal with you.&rdquo; When the devil failed in this action, he left the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Killing the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, that he should betray Him&rdquo;; &ldquo;Satan entered into him&rdquo;; &ldquo;Stretch out your hands against Me. But this is your hour and the authority of darkness&rdquo;</strong> (John 13:2, 27; Luke 22:53).</p>
<p>When the devil was unsuccessful in tempting the Lord Jesus, he killed the Lord. This was his fourth action. He put the thought of betraying the Lord Jesus into the heart of Judas, and he personally entered into Judas to compel him to betray the Lord Jesus. The Jews who arrested the Lord Jesus and the Romans who crucified Him were all controlled and moved by the devil. The devil killed the Lord Jesus because the Lord constantly stood in the position of a man without denying that He was God (John 5:18; 10:30-39). The Lord was condemned because He would not deny that He was the Son of God, but even though He did not deny this truth, He always stood in the position of a man in order to deal with the devil (Matt. 26:59-66). Although this action seemed to be successful, the devil&rsquo;s own cleverness caused him to be judged and destroyed through the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross in His human flesh (John 12:31-32; 16:11; Heb. 2:14).</p><h2 class="head2">Being Embodied in Antichrist</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority&rdquo;; &ldquo;The coming of whom is according to Satan&rsquo;s operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 13:2; 2 Thes. 2:9).</p>
<p>When the devil is thrown out of heaven to earth at the end of this age, he will realize that his time is short (Rev. 12:9-10, 12). At this time he will raise up Antichrist, the beast, who will embody his evil element with all its poison. The devil will give his power, throne, and authority to Antichrist and cause Antichrist to willfully do evil on the earth. The appearance of Antichrist will be according to Satan&rsquo;s operation, and Antichrist will do wondrous miracles in order to deceive people. Through Antichrist, the devil will do everything that he can to inflict harm on the saints of God and the people on earth. He will vent all his hatred and fury on them. His actions through Antichrist will reflect the intention behind his first rebellion against God; that is, he will cause Antichrist to stand against the Lord, to uplift himself, and to proclaim himself God. This is his fifth action in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Deceiving the Nations on Earth<br />
for the Last Time</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:7-8).</p>
<p>At the end of the millennial kingdom the devil will be temporarily released from his imprisonment, and he will deceive the nations on the earth. He will cause them to surround and attack God&rsquo;s saints and God&rsquo;s people, but fire will come out of heaven and devour them. This is his sixth action in the universe, and it will be his last. After this, he will be thrown into the lake of fire to be punished for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS WORK IN RELATION TO MAN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who deceives the whole inhabited earth&rdquo;; &ldquo;Deceive the nations&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:9; 20:3).</p>
<p>The first work of the devil in relation to man is to deceive man. His deception extends to the whole inhabited earth and to all the nations on earth. He uses all kinds of people and things to deceive man. There is no person, matter, or thing that cannot be used in order to deceive people, and there is no one who cannot be deceived by him. He uses money, enjoyment, vainglory, fame, knowledge, and position to deceive man. He also uses spouses, children, clothing, food, dwelling, and transportation to deceive man. He uses wealth, leisure, sophisticated living, and modern culture to deceive man, and he also uses poverty, hard work, simple living, and traditions to deceive man. He can use secular things that are unrelated to serving God to deceive man, and he can use religious things involving zealous service for God. He deceives us by using the people and things that we like and enjoy. He uses the things that are personally associated with each of us in order to deceive us. People all over the earth and throughout all the ages&mdash;whether rich or poor, noble or lowly, wise or foolish, strong or weak&mdash;have been snared in his deceptions. Who has not been deceived by him? He deceives the entire inhabited earth. He deceives all the nations.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Has blinded the thoughts&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>The devil blinds man&rsquo;s thoughts so that man cannot know God or see the origin, meaning, and purpose of his existence, thus preventing him from receiving the gospel and being saved. Many Ph.D.&rsquo;s and college professors are very bright and thoughtful. But even though they are filled with scientific knowledge and understand many principles, they do not know the reason and purpose of their existence. What little knowledge of God and of the things related to Him that they have is considered by them to be foolish superstitions with no meaning or value. This proves that the devil has blinded their thoughts so that they would not have the inward sight to see God. The devil does not want the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ to shine in them to bring them out of darkness into the light. These worldly people are under the devil&rsquo;s blinding covering, and they are living a dull, confused, sightless existence, not knowing either their origin or their destination.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand, the evil one comes and snatches away&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 13:19).</p>
<p>When people hear the word of God, the devil works to snatch it away. The word of God enlightens the eyes of man&rsquo;s heart and causes him to see spiritual things concerning God. It regenerates his spirit and causes him to obtain the life of God and participate in the spiritual things of God. Consequently, the devil comes to snatch away the word of God from man&rsquo;s heart in order to keep him in darkness and death.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The tares are the sons of the evil one; and the enemy who sowed them is the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 13:38-39).</p>
<p>The devil also works to damage the church by mixing false believers, or tares, into the church. This causes the church to lose her purity outwardly.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The whole was leavened&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 13:33).</p>
<p>The devil not only mixes false believers into the church but also mixes heretical teachings as evil leaven into the church. This causes the church to be corrupted inwardly. With respect to the faith, he fills the church with heresies that are not according to the truth, and with respect to living, he fills the church with evil things that go against the Lord&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking someone to devour&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 5:8).</p>
<p>This devil is like a roaring lion who walks about the whole earth seeking someone to devour, that is, someone who will accept his tempting, misleading, and ensnaring influence.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Satan himself transfigures himself into an angel of light&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 11:14).</p>
<p>Although the devil comes to devour people as a roaring lion, he can also transfigure himself into a lovely angel of light in order to deceive people. Even believers who are on guard against him as a roaring lion sometimes receive him as an angel of light. They escape his terrible devouring but accept his bright deception. Therefore, the devil in his brightness often can do more damage to the saints and the church than he can through his roaring and devouring. For three centuries the Roman Empire roared like a lion and damaged the church, but that damage was nothing compared to the damage done by the Roman government&rsquo;s acceptance of Christianity as the state religion in the fourth century. When the church is under the devil&rsquo;s roaring persecution, we do not need to fear too much for the church, but when she receives the devil&rsquo;s welcoming face as an angel of light, we must truly be in fear.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Tempted you&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 3:5).</p>
<p>Since the devil can transform himself into an angel of light, he can tempt people. His transformation is for his temptation. This is another aspect of his work.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;You are about to suffer&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:10).</p>
<p>When the devil is not successful in tempting the saints, he causes them to suffer. His work is varied, and he always changes his methods.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Satan has asked to have you all to sift you as wheat&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 22:31).</p>
<p>The devil sifts the believers like people sift wheat. If a believer does not have strong faith, it is hard to pass through this sifting and remain firm. Therefore, the Lord constantly prays for us concerning this matter so that we would not lose faith (v. 32).</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;The stratagems of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:11).</p>
<p>The devil uses stratagems. He is crafty, and he has many schemes and deceptive works to help him arrive at his evil goal.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;A messenger of Satan, that he might buffet&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 12:7).</p>
<p>The devil buffets the saints through their circumstances and situations.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;Satan stood up against Israel and moved David to number Israel&rdquo;</strong> (1 Chron. 21:1).</p>
<p>Moving the saints is another aspect of the devil&rsquo;s work. Whenever the saints are moved, regardless of the reason, the devil is behind their movement. Sometimes if we would only wait for five minutes, we would escape the devil&rsquo;s attempts to move us.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;Satan hindered us&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 2:18).</p>
<p>The devil often hinders the Lord&rsquo;s workers in order to slow down and damage the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;Satan standing at his right hand to be his adversary&rdquo;</strong> (Zech. 3:1).</p>
<p>The devil takes advantage of every opportunity to be an adversary to the saints. He points out our mistakes so that we will be embarrassed, and he traps us in difficult situations so that we will be discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>16. &ldquo;The accuser of our brothers&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:10; see also Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7).</p>
<p>Because the devil is the adversary of the saints, he is always accusing us. He accuses us before God and in our conscience. He can go before God to accuse us as he accused Job, and he can accuse and condemn us in our conscience in order to interrupt our fellowship with the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s blood is the only thing that enables us to overcome his accusations (Rev. 12:11).</p>
<p><strong>17. &ldquo;Deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:5; see also 1 Tim. 1:20).</p>
<p>When the believers sin and are unwilling to repent, they bring Satan&rsquo;s destruction of their flesh upon themselves. Therefore, the devil also harms the believers&rsquo; bodies.</p>
<p><strong>18. &ldquo;The snare of the devil, having been caught alive by him&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:26).</p>
<p>The devil works upon man in order to catch alive the man whom God created and redeemed for Himself.</p>
<p><strong>19. &ldquo;The tempter came&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 4:3).</p>
<p>Temptation is a constant work of the devil; therefore, the Bible calls him the tempter.</p>
<p><strong>20. &ldquo;Satan filled your heart to deceive the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 5:3).</p>
<p>Satan fills people&rsquo;s hearts and causes them to deceive the Holy Spirit. This is one of the devil&rsquo;s devious works in man&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p><strong>21. &ldquo;Son of the devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:10).</p>
<p>The devil uses men to pervert the straight ways of the Lord and to damage the Lord&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p><strong>22. &ldquo;Satan has bound&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 13:16).</p>
<p>The devil causes people to suffer because of his binding work. He binds them with sickness, and he binds them with affairs. The goal of his binding is to limit man&rsquo;s pursuit of God.</p>
<p><strong>23. &ldquo;An unclean spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 5:2).</p>
<p>The devil possesses people through demons and causes them to suffer indescribable horrors.</p>
<p>The preceding items relate to the works of the devil. They are truly varied, and the devil can use them at will to attack from any direction.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS METHODS IN HIS WORK</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Hiding in Persons, Things, and Matters</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Now the serpent was more crafty than any other animal of the field that Jehovah God had made. And he said to the woman, Did God really say, You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?...You shall not surely die!&rdquo;; &ldquo;As the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 3:1, 4; 2 Cor. 11:3).</p>
<p>The devil always hides within persons, things, and matters to carry out his work. This has been the special characteristic of his methods from the beginning. He is deceitful and false, devious and crafty. He never shows his real face; instead, he hides in persons, things, and matters. The first reference in the Bible to his deceptive work shows that he hid himself in a serpent. He was crafty as the serpent and did not let man know that he was hiding in the serpent.</p>
<p>The devil hides in persons, things, and matters that are usually beautiful and clever. The serpent in which he originally hid was more crafty than any other living creature, so it must have been clever, marvelous, attractive, and pleasing to others. When he hides in eye-catching, pleasant, and clever things, the devil attracts people&rsquo;s attention in order to seduce and deceive them. We must beware of things that easily attract our attention and cause us to love and desire them. We must beware of beautiful and clever persons, things, and matters, for they are often used by the devil to mislead, seduce, deceive, trap, corrupt, and capture us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, God be merciful to You, Lord! This shall by no means happen to You! But He turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:22-23).</p>
<p>Satan can hide even in disciples who love the Lord. Peter cared for the Lord according to his own will. Satan was able to hide within Peter&rsquo;s care and good intentions to try to prevent the Lord from accomplishing God&rsquo;s will. Peter did not realize that Satan was hiding within his good intentions; only the Lord could see this matter clearly. Therefore, the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; At that moment, in the Lord&rsquo;s eyes Peter was Satan. Since Peter allowed Satan to hide within him, the Lord saw him as Satan. Satan was so hidden and deceptive that even Peter did not realize that he was speaking and acting for Satan. Instead, he thought that he was speaking and acting for himself. Peter was deceived and used by Satan because he trusted in his own love and care for the Lord and in his good heart and good intentions for the Lord. We must be careful of our good intentions for the Lord. We must also be careful of the good heart and good intentions of those who love and care for us. These are often Satan&rsquo;s best hiding places from which he can deceive us and damage God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Satan entered into him&rdquo;</strong> (John 13:27, see also v. 2).</p>
<p>Judas&rsquo;s betrayal of the Lord was accomplished by Satan hiding in him. Satan first put the idea of betraying the Lord into him and then entered into him to accomplish this betrayal. On the surface, Judas was betraying the Lord, but actually it was Satan. This is Satan&rsquo;s usual method.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The lawless one...the coming of whom is according to Satan&rsquo;s operation&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:8-9, see also vv. 3-4).</p>
<p>In the future, Antichrist will come according to Satan&rsquo;s operation. Satan will hide in him, and Antichrist will be his embodiment. He will be Satan incarnate. Just as God was incarnated and lived in Christ to accomplish His good purpose, Satan will be incarnated and live in Antichrist to accomplish his evil purpose. Just as Christ is the embodiment of God, Antichrist will be the embodiment of Satan. Christ, as the embodiment of God, is light to save people, but Antichrist, as the embodiment of Satan, will be darkness to cunningly deceive people.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;You once walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, of the spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2).</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we walked according to the age of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, Satan, the evil spirit which is now operating in the sons of disobedience. We were controlled by Satan, and even though we are now saved, Satan still hides himself and operates in us. Since Satan hides within the people of the world to carry out his work, who can say that he is truly free from Satan&rsquo;s manipulation and operation?</p><h2 class="head2">Using Craftiness and Schemes</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;As the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 11:3).</p>
<p>When the devil works, he uses not only persons, things, and matters but also craftiness. On the one hand, he hides in persons, things, and matters to keep people from recognizing him, and on the other hand, he uses craftiness to deceive people. When he deceived Eve, he hid in the serpent and he used crafty words.</p>
<p>The devil&rsquo;s craftiness involves mixing falsehoods with the truth. It involves falsehood masquerading as truth, wrong things appearing as right, and right things appearing as wrong. The words that he spoke to Eve were falsehoods mixed with truth. Right and wrong were turned upside down. The devil still uses this method today and will continue to do so (2 Thes. 2:9-10).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:11; see also 2 Cor. 2:11).</p>
<p>The devil uses not only crafty ways in his work but also stratagems. His stratagems are always varied. We need the whole armor of God to stand against them. He can use all kinds of persons, things, and matters as his stratagems to trap us. He can also devise stratagems to deceive us and distract us from our true status before God, our true obtainments from God, our true service to God, our true love for God, and our true enjoyment of God. All his stratagems involve some element of truth being mixed with false and evil things; therefore, it is difficult to discern and recognize his stratagems. We need to be watchful and to pray, asking God to expose the devil&rsquo;s stratagems so that we would not be ignorant of his stratagems.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS JUDGMENT</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I cast you out as profane from the mountain of God...I cast you to the ground&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 28:16-17).</p>
<p>When the devil rebelled against God, he was immediately judged, condemned, and cast out of the heavens. Although God pronounced judgment against the devil at that time, He did not fully carry out His judgment.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out&rdquo;; &ldquo;The ruler of this world has been judged&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:31; 16:11).</p>
<p>Although God pronounced judgment on the devil and limited his rebellion, He did not immediately cast the devil out of the world or take back the authority that had been given to him. When the Lord died on the cross, He carried out God&rsquo;s original judgment on the devil through His crucifixion, and He cast the devil out of the world. Although the Lord&rsquo;s death fulfilled the legal basis for God&rsquo;s judgment of the devil, this judgment has not been fully executed. Therefore, after the Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion, the devil can continue to move and work until the Lord completes the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment against him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;That through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>Through His death on the cross, the Lord judged the devil; that is, by the death of His physical body, He destroyed the devil who has the might of death. The Lord also destroyed his authority, position, and power to work. Through the Lord&rsquo;s judgment on the cross, the devil has no position or power before God to work in or on people.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Cast down&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:9-10, see also v. 13).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the Lord carried out and accomplished God&rsquo;s judgment against the devil on the cross by abolishing his authority, position, and power, the devil will be cast to the ground only at the end of this age when he is dealt with by the overcomers in the church and the angels who did not rebel in heaven (vv. 1-9, 11). At this time the devil will have no position either in the heavens or in the air, and since he will have only a short time to move about on the earth, he will pour out all his hatred and fury on the saints and the people of God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Bound him for a thousand years and cast him into the abyss&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:2-3).</p>
<p>At the end of this age the devil will be cast down to the earth. Shortly afterward, the Lord will come from the heavens and tell an angel to lay hold of the devil, bind him with a chain, cast him into the abyss, and seal it over so that he might not deceive the nations until a thousand years are completed. Then he will be loosed for a little while. This will fulfill God&rsquo;s word in Isaiah 14:15 concerning the judgment the devil will receive. After one thousand years, there will be only one step left in the carrying out of God&rsquo;s judgment on the devil.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Cast into the lake of fire and brimstone&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:10).</p>
<p>After the devil has been shut up in the abyss for one thousand years, he will be released. As soon as he gets out, he will begin to do evil and to deceive the nations on earth. He will gather them together and cause them to surround God&rsquo;s saints and God&rsquo;s people. Then God will send fire from heaven to devour them, and the devil will be thrown into the lake of fire where he will be tormented day and night forever and ever. This eternal fire has been prepared for the devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41). At this point God&rsquo;s judgment against the devil will be complete.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s judgment against the devil is completed step by step, with each step pushing him lower than the previous one. In the first step he was cast out of the heavens to the air. In the second step he will be cast from the air to the earth. In the third step he will be thrown into the abyss, and in the fourth step he will be thrown into the lake of fire. Once he is in the lake of fire, he will be at the bottom. Because of his pride, he wanted to uplift himself and exalt his throne over all the stars. He wanted to ascend into heaven and be equal with God. Little did he know that God would cast him down step by step until he was in the lowest place, the lake of fire. This will fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s word: &ldquo;He who will exalt himself shall be humbled&rdquo; (23:12).</p><h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS AND THE DEVIL</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:13; see also Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>God saves believers out of the devil&rsquo;s kingdom and delivers them out of the authority of darkness so that they are no longer tyrannized by him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:18).</p>
<p>Believers are begotten of God and have the life of God. This life protects believers from the devil&rsquo;s attacks. As long as we live by this life, the devil cannot touch us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;You have overcome the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:13, 14).</p>
<p>Those who belong to God and have His life can overcome the devil. If we let God&rsquo;s word of life abide in us and accomplish its life-giving effect in us, we will overcome the evil one, the devil.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Deliver us from the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:13; see also John 17:15; 2 Thes. 3:3).</p>
<p>We not only have God&rsquo;s life and word within us to enable us to overcome the devil, but God Himself protects and delivers us from the devil. The Lord prayed for this, and we also should pray that God would protect us and deliver us from the devil, the evil one.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 10:19; see also Rom. 16:20).</p>
<p>The Lord has given us the authority to tread upon the devil and his angels and to overcome their power. They have power, but the Lord has given us authority. Authority is higher than power. Authority controls power, just as a policeman controls powerful cars with his authority.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:11).</p>
<p>We can overcome the enemy because of the Lord&rsquo;s blood. The devil often points out our sins and accuses us, but we must rely on the Lord&rsquo;s blood to overcome his accusations. We also can overcome the enemy because of the word of our testimony. When we testify that the Lord has overcome the devil and has already destroyed him, the devil is defeated. Finally, we can overcome the enemy when we do not love our soul-life even unto death, that is, to not love or care for ourselves even to the point of death.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;In My name they will cast out demons&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 16:17).</p>
<p>We can cast out demons in the Lord&rsquo;s name. We cannot cast out demons by our own power and strength but only in the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Neither give place to the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:27).</p>
<p>We cannot give place to the devil. Once we give him a little place, he will work to harm us.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;We are not ignorant of his schemes&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 2:11).</p>
<p>We should not be ignorant of the devil&rsquo;s schemes. We are fighting against him, and he is an enemy who is full of schemes. Therefore, in order to overcome him, we must not be ignorant of his schemes.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Be sober; watch...Withstand, being firm in your faith&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 5:8-9; see also James 4:7).</p>
<p>With respect to the devil, we must be sober and watchful, withstanding him by being firm in our faith. We cannot be loose; we must be watchful.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:11).</p>
<p>In order to stand against the devil, we must put on the whole armor of God. An individual Christian cannot wear the whole armor of God; it must be worn by the church. We must fight the devil&rsquo;s authority of darkness with all the saints. The warfare in Ephesians 6 is a warfare between the church and the devil&rsquo;s authority of darkness; therefore, the armor in Ephesians 6 must be worn by the church. If we live in the church, the Body of Christ, and put on the whole armor of God with all the saints in order to stand against the devil, we will overcome him and bring in the kingdom of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WORLD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">OUTLINE</h2>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The terms for the world.</li>
<li>The condition of the world.</li>
<li>The believers and the world.</li>
<p>We have studied the topic of the devil, and now we must study the topic of the world because the world is related to the devil. Furthermore, the world is a practical problem that we encounter when we live on the earth. Therefore, we cannot be ignorant of this topic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TERMS FOR THE WORLD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;World&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;world&rdquo; is <em>kosmos,</em> and it means &ldquo;system,&rdquo; or &ldquo;organization.&rdquo; The world is an arranged system or a systemized organization. This system was not created by God; it was organized by Satan. In the beginning God created the earth and all the things on the earth so that man could live on the earth for the accomplishment of His purpose. After Satan spoiled and captured man, Satan organized the things on the earth that were for man&rsquo;s existence into an ordered system. The Bible refers to this ordered system as the world. The world is out of Satan and belongs to him for his use. It is an organization and an ordered system under his control. Satan usurps people through his worldly arrangement and system in order to keep them from being for God, serving God, and accomplishing God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>There is a difference between the systematized things of the world and the created things of the earth. The created things of the earth were ordained by God so that man could live for Him, but the systematized things of the world were ordered by Satan to usurp man so that man could not live for God. Satan arranged the world using the things that God ordained for man&rsquo;s existence. These things have become the components of Satan&rsquo;s system. He systematizes all the persons, things, and matters that God ordained for man&rsquo;s existence along with some of his own inventions to organize the world so that he can usurp man. Satan has mixed the world and the things that he invented with the things of the earth that were ordained by God so that it is difficult for man to distinguish between the two. For example, marriage, children, family, food, and other matters of man&rsquo;s living are all ordained by God for his existence on the earth so that he can live for God. But Satan has taken the things that man needs for his existence and incorporated them into a worldly system in order to usurp man so that he would not be free to live for God. Originally, marriage, children, family, food, and other matters of man&rsquo;s living were ordained by God so that he could live for God. Now marriage, children, family, clothing, food, and other matters have become things of the world to usurp man so that he cannot live for God. Anything that allows man to live for God is not something of the world, but anything that systematizes man and prevents him from living for God is something of the world. Whether or not something is of the world depends on whether it enables us to live for God or hinders us from living for God. For example, some marry in order to exist and live for God. They are not systematized or controlled by their marriage. To them marriage is something of the earth that is related to their existence; it is not something of the world that usurps them. However, some are systematized and controlled by their marriage to the extent that they do not care for God&rsquo;s purpose. To them marriage is part of Satan&rsquo;s systematization of humanity which usurps them.</p>
<p>In addition to the basic necessities of human existence, Satan also invented things that are not necessary for human living but which tempt people to the extent that they are even more fully systematized and usurped. For example, when some marry, they feel that they must ride in a decorated vehicle, have a certain kind of ceremony, or wear a certain kind of veil. Others feel they must celebrate when a child is born by eating special foods. Still others feel that they must wear special clothes in celebration of a new year or other festivals. None of these things are needed for human existence; they all were invented by Satan to further systematize us in relation to basic human necessities. Although marriage and childbearing are necessary for human existence, riding in a decorated vehicle, wearing a fancy veil, eating special foods, and wearing special clothes are not necessary for human living. Satan has added these items to our basic human necessities in order to further systematize and usurp us.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, the world is a system, an organization, or arrangement that Satan uses to control us. The world is like a university with many different departments that encompass the various aspects of human existence, such as the Marriage Department, the Wedding Department, the Funeral Department, the Clothing Department, the Food Department, the Education Department, the Money Department, the Fame Department, and the Position Department. Satan uses this &ldquo;University of the World&rdquo; to systematize the people on earth into various departments. He uses our preferences and desires to control us. If we enjoy clothing, he will use clothing to control us. If we enjoy money, he will use money to control us. If we are &ldquo;enrolled&rdquo; in any of his departments, we are under his usurpation, and we are no longer free to live for God or to serve Him. When we are in his worldly organization, we are under its usurpation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Age&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:4).</p>
<p>In addition to the term <em>kosmos,</em> the Bible also uses the word <em>aion</em> to speak of the world. <em>Aion</em> means &ldquo;age,&rdquo; or &ldquo;time.&rdquo; In the Chinese Union Version, <em>aion</em> and <em>kosmos</em> are translated without distinction, but in the original Greek, these words are clearly distinct. <em>Kosmos</em> refers to the entire world, and <em>aion</em> refers to a part of the world, to an age or time period of the world. The entire world from the past to the future is the <em>kosmos,</em> but it is divided into many ages. Each age is an <em>aion.</em> Thus, we find the phrase <em>according to the age</em> [<em>aion</em>] <em>of this world</em> [<em>kosmos</em>] in Ephesians 2:2. The age of this world is the current time period in the world, the world as it presently appears before our eyes. The part of the world that each generation of people on earth encounters is its age. The part of the world that people encountered in the nineteenth century was the age of the nineteenth century. The part of the world that people encounter in the twentieth century is the age of the twentieth century. An age is the world as it appears before our eyes. Thus, when the Bible speaks of people being according to the world, it says &ldquo;according to the age of this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;age&rdquo; is <em>aion.</em> A closely related English word is <em>modern.</em> Thus, we can translate <em>age</em> in Ephesians 2:2 as &ldquo;fashion.&rdquo; The world that appears before our eyes is what is modern and fashionable. Every age has a definition of what is modern and fashionable. For example, it used to be fashionable for Chinese people to ride in a sedan chair as part of their marriage ceremony, but today it is fashionable for them to ride in a decorated car. It used to be fashionable for people to wear one kind of clothing, but now another kind of clothing is modern and fashionable. These modern things and fashions are the age, the part of the world that people presently encounter. Therefore, Satan uses the things of this age to control and usurp people.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;Generation&rdquo; (Matt. 12:39; Acts 2:40; Phil. 2:15).</p>
<p>The Greek word in the Bible that speaks of man&rsquo;s relationship to the world is <em>gene&#225;.</em> This word is translated as &ldquo;generation&rdquo; in Luke 11:50-51 and Hebrews 3:10. It does not refer to an age but to a generation of people. <em>Generation</em> refers to the people who live in a certain age of the world. A person who lives in a certain age of the world is part of its generation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION OF THE WORLD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The whole world lies in the evil one&rdquo;; &ldquo;The ruler of this world [<em>kosmos</em>]&rdquo;; &ldquo;The world [<em>aion</em>]-rulers of this darkness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:19; John 12:31; Eph. 6:12).</p>
<p>Since the world comes from Satan, it lies in him. The Bible says that the whole world lies in the evil one. This means that the whole world is under the control of Satan, the evil one. He is the ruler of this world (<em>kosmos</em>) and the world (<em>aion</em>)-ruler of this darkness. Anyone who lives according to the age of the world is controlled by Satan and lies in him. Such a one is under his rule. He is not free but instead is completely subject to Satan&rsquo;s whims and tactics. This is the first condition of the world.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The god of this age [<em>aion</em>]&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>Because the world lies in the evil one, it is under his control, and it responds to his whims. The world accepts his threats and temptations and even worships him as a god. Satan loves to receive such worship. In the previous chapter we saw that he wanted to uplift himself to be equal with God; consequently, in this world (<em>kosmos</em>), he makes himself the god of every age (<em>aion</em>). Furthermore, he wants the generation (<em>gene&#225;</em>) of every age to worship him. In the world that he controls, he is not only the ruler of darkness, ruling the people of every age, but he is also an adulterous god, seducing and corrupting every generation. This is the second condition of the world.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Enmity with God&rdquo;</strong> (James 4:4).</p>
<p>The world is at enmity with God because it is controlled by Satan as its king and seduced by him as its god. James 4:4 says, &ldquo;The friendship of the world (<em>kosmos</em>) is enmity with God.&rdquo; First John 2:15 says, &ldquo;If anyone loves the world (<em>kosmos</em>), love for the Father is not in him.&rdquo; The entire world is at enmity with God because its inventor and ruler is against God. This is the third condition of the world.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The present evil age&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:4).</p>
<p>Since the world that is controlled and seduced by Satan is at enmity with God, every age of the world is evil because its ruler and seducer, the evil one, is evil. This is the fourth condition of the world.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;An evil and adulterous generation&rdquo;; &ldquo;Crooked generation&rdquo;; &ldquo;A crooked and perverted generation&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 12:39; Acts 2:40; Phil. 2:15).</p>
<p>All the generations (<em>genea&#237;</em>) are evil because every age of the world is evil. Every generation is adulterous, crooked, and perverted because every generation has been seduced and corrupted by the evil one. The words <em>evil, adulterous, crooked,</em> and <em>perverted</em> are vivid descriptions of the corrupt condition of the worldly generations. <em>Evil</em> emphasizes their inward nature, and <em>adulterous</em> emphasizes their outward behavior. <em>Crooked</em> emphasizes their relationship with others, and <em>perverted</em> emphasizes their relationship with God. The people of every generation are evil in their nature, adulterous in their conduct, crooked in their relationship with others, and perverted in their relationship with God. This is the fifth condition of the world.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father but is of the world...But he who does the will of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:16-17).</p>
<p>The world that Satan arranged to usurp man seemingly has many different kinds of things. These things, however, can be divided into three categories: the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life. The lust of the flesh causes people to indulge in the flesh to gain enjoyment. The lust of the eyes causes people to covet what is pleasing to their eyes for their enjoyment. The vainglory of life causes people to be proud and to uplift themselves so that they may be able to boast in themselves. Satan uses the things in these three categories to control and usurp man. None of these things come from God; they all come from the evil one who has organized this world. They are all in opposition to the will of God. The world is the enemy of God, and the things in the world are in opposition to the will of God. If we love the world, we cannot love God; if we do the things of the world, we cannot do God&rsquo;s will. If we want to understand and prove the will of God, we cannot be conformed to this age, to the modern things in the world (Rom. 12:2).</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Now is the judgment of this world&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:31).</p>
<p>God cannot tolerate the world and has condemned it because it is of Satan, it is in enmity with God, it usurps man, and it is full of evil and adultery. God judged the world on the cross through the Lord Jesus. As the Lord was dying on the cross in His physical body, God judged Satan, the organizer of the world, and the world that lies in him.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;The world is passing away, and its lust&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:17).</p>
<p>The pronouncement of judgment is followed by the execution of judgment. Since God judged the world, He will carry out His judgment by wiping out the world. The world and its lusts, which are the things in the world, are passing away. The world and the things in it are under the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment. They will not last very long, much less remain for eternity. They will pass away.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;The fashion of this world is passing away&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 7:31).</p>
<p>The world is under the execution of God&rsquo;s judgment. It will not be wiped away only in the future; it is passing away daily. It is passing away to the point that God will completely destroy it. Therefore, the Bible says that the fashion of this world is passing away. This is the fate of the world, its final end. This is also the last condition of the world.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS AND THE WORLD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:4).</p>
<p>The Lord gave Himself for our sins not merely to save us from our sins but also to rescue us out of the present evil age (<em>aion</em>), which is the world that appears before our eyes. In the Lord&rsquo;s salvation we were rescued from the evil age that is in opposition to God. We were rescued from the present condition of Satan&rsquo;s worldly organization.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Be saved from this crooked generation&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:40).</p>
<p>We should allow the Lord to save us from this crooked generation in our daily living because we were rescued out of this present evil age by the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. Since we have received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, we should live a life according to His salvation. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation rescued us out of the present evil age; therefore, we should not walk like those in this crooked generation. We should be different from them and separated from them. This is not something that we can do in ourselves. Only the Lord can do this, and He accomplished this on the cross. Through the Holy Spirit He wants to apply what He accomplished on the cross so that we can receive His practical salvation. But we must let Him do this. We must let Him save us. Although we cannot save ourselves, we can let the Lord save us. Although we do not bear responsibility for our salvation, we must bear responsibility to let Him save us in a daily way. The Lord can save us, and He wants to apply His salvation to us, but if we do not let Him, He has no way to do anything. Thus, the question for us is whether or not we will let the Lord save us. If we let the Lord save us, He will save us from this crooked generation. Since we have received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, we should let the Lord save us. This is the responsibility we should bear.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<p>The world corrupts people by lust. By our own strength we cannot escape the corruption that is in the world by lust. Only God&rsquo;s life in us can save us from the corruption that is in the world by lust. Being saved from the corruption in the world is a promise of God. Therefore, we should let God save us, and we should believe that God will save us from the corruption in the world by lust.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Training us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:12).</p>
<p>Since God promised to save us from worldly lusts, He trains us to deny these lusts. If we want to practically enjoy God&rsquo;s salvation so that God can fulfill His promises and save us from the world, we should cooperate with God to receive His training and learn to deny worldly lusts. In order to live a life that is practically apart from the world, we must allow God to save us, believe His promises, and receive His training. We cannot be short in any of these matters.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory which has overcome the world&mdash;our faith&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:4).</p>
<p>We received God&rsquo;s salvation, and we can cooperate with God, letting Him save us from the world, because we have been begotten of God. His life enables us to overcome the world. The life of God within us not only requires us to leave the world but also enables us to overcome the world. As long as we fulfill the requirements of this life to live and act according to the feeling of this life, we will spontaneously be led out of the world and will overcome the world. God and His life are within us, and God is greater than he who is in the world (4:4). When we receive this by faith, we overcome the world. If we live by the life of God and believe that this life can save us from the world, we will overcome the world.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The world has been crucified to me and I to the world&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<p>In order to be practically separated from the world, we must also see how the cross dealt with the world and with us who live in the world. The Lord&rsquo;s cross dealt both with the world and with us who live in the world. With respect to ourselves, the world was crucified to us. With respect to the world, we were crucified to the world. Thus, the cross separated us from the world, just as the Red Sea separated the Israelites from Egypt. The world is dead to us, and we are dead to the world because of the cross. The death of Christ on the cross dealt with both us and the world. The Lord has already accomplished this fact for us. We should know and receive this fact in faith so that we can live a life that is separated from the world and that overcomes the world.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;If you died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, do you subject yourselves&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:20).</p>
<p>Death causes people to depart from the world. We have left the world and no longer live in the world because we were crucified with the Lord. Everyone who has received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, dying together with Him, should be one who has left the world and no longer lives in it.</p>
<p>Buddhist monks attempt to leave the world by rejecting marriage, children, families, and all matters related to human propagation. They do not live a normal human life. In contrast, we leave the world by leaving the control and usurpation of these things. We leave the world, but we still marry, have children, families, and all the matters related to the continuation of humanity. We live a normal human life, but we are not controlled and usurped by these things. We leave the usurping element of these human matters while restoring these things to their proper place in God&rsquo;s plan for human existence. On the one hand, we have died with the Lord and escaped Satan&rsquo;s usurping world; on the other hand, we are living a normal human life with the Lord on the earth according to God&rsquo;s ordination. We live for God, testifying of the Lord and preaching the Lord&rsquo;s gospel. Although we live among human beings, eating and wearing clothing like ordinary people, we are not controlled and usurped by these things. Instead, we live for God. This is what it means to live in the world according to the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Keep oneself unspotted from the world&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:27).</p>
<p>Before God the world is filthy; it is even filthier than sin. Therefore, we who are saved by the Lord from the world should keep ourselves unspotted from its filth. We cannot do this in ourselves; we must do it in the Lord by relying on His life.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Do not be fashioned according to this age&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 12:2).</p>
<p>Every fallen descendant of Adam has the tendency to turn to the world, to love fashions, and to gladly follow worldly customs. But if we would keep ourselves unspotted from the world, we cannot be fashioned according to this age (<em>aion</em>). If we are fashioned according to this age, we will be conformed to the likeness of the world and be permeated and spotted by the world. As those who have presented ourselves as a living sacrifice to God, we should not be fashioned according to this age. This is the Lord&rsquo;s command in Romans 12:2.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Having loved the present age&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:10).</p>
<p>Although the world is very lovely and draws people to love it, we must keep ourselves unspotted from it by not loving the present age. The present age is the world before our eyes that draws our heart to love the things in the world. If we love the present age, like Demas in this verse, we will be full of worldly spots.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:15).</p>
<p>Since the world is God&rsquo;s enemy, we should have no love for it. Once we love the world, love for the Father is no longer in us. We must live a life that is separated from the world. We must keep ourselves unspotted from the world. Loving God is the best way to be separated from and unspotted by the world. By loving God, we can keep ourselves from loving the world and keep the world from usurping and defiling us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE</h1>

	</ol></li>
<li>Six simple statements concerning sin.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the previous chapter we saw that the world is connected to Satan. Now we need to examine another topic that is related to him&mdash;sin. Sin is connected not only to Satan but also to the world. These three topics&mdash;the devil, the world, and sin&mdash;are closely related.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGINATOR OF SIN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The anointed cherub&rdquo;; &ldquo;The devil&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 28:14; 1 John 3:8; John 8:44).</p>
<p>The originator of sin is the devil. In chapter 53 we saw that he is the cherub anointed by God, the highest archangel, who became proud and rebelled against God. His rebellion against God was the beginning of sin. He is the first sinner in the universe. He sinned &ldquo;out of his own possessions&rdquo; (v. 44). He is a sinner from the beginning. Therefore, this sinning archangel is the originator of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF SIN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The devil has sinned from the beginning&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:8).</p>
<p>The devil has sinned from the beginning. This refers to the time before man was created. Before there was man, there was sin. Sin originated with the devil at the time of his sin. When the anointed cherub, the highest archangel, became the devil, sin came into existence.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENTRANCE OF SIN INTO MAN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through one man sin entered into the world&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:12).</p>
<p>After sin originated with the devil and after the creation of man, the devil tempted man to rebel against God. Through his temptation, the sin within him was injected like poison into man. The devil injected his poison into Adam, the ancestor of the human race, by tempting him to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. All humans are Adam&rsquo;s descendants. When the devil injected his sin into Adam, sin was passed to all his descendants. Therefore, sin is present in all humanity. When a person is born, sin is present within him. No one is not sinless; neither does one have to wait to commit a sin in order to be sinful. A person is sinful because his parents are sinful, having received the sin that was injected into Adam and which has been passed from generation to generation from our common ancestor Adam. According to the Bible, sin entered into the world through one man, Adam.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INDWELLING OF SIN (SINGULAR) IN MAN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I am fleshy, sold under sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:14).</p>
<p>The Bible speaks of both sin and sins, with <em>sin</em> referring to indwelling sin and <em>sins</em> referring to outward manifestations of sinful acts. Since indwelling sin relates to man&rsquo;s sinful nature, it is often referred to in the Bible in the singular as <em>sin.</em> Since outward sins relate to man&rsquo;s sinful actions, it is often referred to in the Bible in the plural as <em>sins.</em> Romans chapter 1 through the first part of chapter 5 emphasizes our outward sins, our sinful actions. The second half of chapter 5 through chapter 8 emphasizes our sinful nature, the sin that indwells us. Man&rsquo;s sinful nature is present from birth. We are sold under the sinful nature that we inherited from Adam. When Adam followed Satan to rebel against God, he sold himself to sin and also sold all his descendants to sin. Adam and all his descendants have a sinful nature and are slaves to sin. No one is free from sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;It is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:17, 20).</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s inward nature is full of sin, and it is active within man. This indwelling sin is actually the personification of the devil within us. As such, sin dwells in us and forces us to do evil and to commit sins.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Sin revived&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:9).</p>
<p>Our sinful nature cannot be separated from our living. Although the operation of sin may seem to be dormant at times, it can always be revived. This shows that sin is part of our living.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind&rdquo;; &ldquo;For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me&rdquo;; &ldquo;Become death to me&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:8, 11, 13).</p>
<p>Since sin is personified in us, it seizes every opportunity to cause us to commit sins. For example, it works out coveting of every kind in us by means of God&rsquo;s commandment, and it can deceive us, kill us, and even become death to us. This proves that indwelling sin is strong and living.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Sin reigned in death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:21; see also 6:12).</p>
<p>In addition to operating in us, indwelling sin reigns with authority in us, controlling us and causing us to die.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Lord it over you&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:14).</p>
<p>Since indwelling sin reigns and exercises authority over us, it also lords over and controls us, making us its slaves. Having been sold to sin as slaves in Adam, sin is our master, and we have no way to escape its control or to free ourselves from it.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The law of sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:25).</p>
<p>Every living thing lives according to a law of life. Since our indwelling sin is living, it also operates according to the law of its life. The Bible calls this law the law of sin. The law of sin is out of sin, belongs to sin, and causes people to sin. This law is in the corrupted members of our flesh, and it fights against the law of good in our mind and eventually captures us (v. 23), causing us to do evil and to die (vv. 21, 24). Since this law causes us to sin and to die, it is also called the law of sin and of death (8:2).</p>
<p>A law is a natural power that operates spontaneously. For example, gravity is a law that acts to draw things toward the earth. Similarly, indwelling sin has a natural power that causes us to sin spontaneously. Because the law of sin operates within us automatically, we do not have to exert any conscious effort to commit sins. Since sin is living in us, it indwells us, reigns over us, lords over us, controls us, enslaves us, makes us do sinful things against our will, and causes us to die. It is a spontaneous law with a natural power that causes us to sin and die.</p>
<p>Most people do not pay attention to this aspect of indwelling sin, and it is also difficult for people to understand. People think of sin primarily in relation to outward actions. Consequently, they do not believe that a person is sinful if he does not commit definite sinful acts. They do not have a clear realization of man&rsquo;s has a sinful nature. Consequently, they do not realize that a person who does not commit gross sinful acts is still full of sin and therefore a sinner. If a peach tree does not produce peaches, it is still a peach tree because it has the nature of a peach tree. It is a peach tree because it has the peach tree nature; it does not need to produce peaches in order to be a peach tree. Similarly, man is sinful and a sinner because he has a sinful nature; he is not a sinner only because he has committed some sinful acts.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF SINS (PLURAL) IN MAN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Sin is lawlessness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:4).</p>
<p>Outward, manifested sins are the sins that people commit; sins are their sinful acts. Since these sinful acts can be many and varied, the word <em>sins</em> is plural. People easily understand this aspect of sin. When people speak of sin, they are usually referring to sins, to sinful acts. Sins are actions that break God&rsquo;s law. Anything that breaks God&rsquo;s law is a sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;All unrighteousness is sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:17).</p>
<p>The phrase <em>all unrighteousness</em> means all things that are unreasonable, illegal, unfair, or not according to proper procedure. These are all sins. Unrighteousness includes everything that we should not say or do but, nevertheless, say and do, and it also includes everything that we should say or do but, nevertheless, do not say or do. Everything in these two categories is a sin, involving sinful acts.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Therefore to him who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin&rdquo;</strong> (James 4:17).</p>
<p>If someone does not fulfill his human responsibility of doing good before God, he has committed a sinful act and falls short before God.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;All that is not out of faith is sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 14:23).</p>
<p>Man should do everything before God in faith, and everything should be done because of faith in God. Whatever is not out of faith is unbelief toward God, and it is offensive to Him. Therefore, it involves a sinful act.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:23).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s glory is the standard for man&rsquo;s living before God. Anything of man that falls short of the glory of God is a sin. All have sinned because all that we are and can do fall short of God&rsquo;s glory. While those who are bad certainly fall short of God&rsquo;s glory, even those who are good fall short of God&rsquo;s glory. While those who are immoral fall short of God&rsquo;s glory, even those who are moral fall short of God&rsquo;s glory. Since all that we can do falls short of the standard of God&rsquo;s glory, we all have sinned.</p>
<p>Sin is manifested outwardly in the various unacceptable acts committed before God. These outward sins come from man&rsquo;s inward nature of sin. Sins are the outward fruit of our inward nature of sin. Man&rsquo;s inward sinful nature produces outward sinful acts. Man&rsquo;s inward sinful life produces outward sinful fruits.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSALITY OF SIN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:9).</p>
<p>Regardless of whether one is a Jew, a member of God&rsquo;s people, or a Greek, a Gentile, he is under sin. Since Jews have broken the law which God gave them and Gentiles have broken the law in their conscience (2:14-15), which was also given by God, all have sinned before God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:23; see also 5:12).</p>
<p>All men, whether moral or immoral, virtuous or evil, good or bad, fall short of the glory of God; therefore, all have sinned.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Surely there is not a righteous man on the earth who does good and does not sin&rdquo;</strong> (Eccl. 7:20; see also 1 Kings 8:46).</p>
<p>According to this verse, there is not a righteous man on the earth who does good and does not sin. This means that there is no one on the earth who has not sinned. All are short before God; therefore, everyone is a sinner. Sin is so widespread! It has spread to include everyone in the world!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF SIN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Your iniquities have become a separation / Between you and your God&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 59:2).</p>
<p>Sin separates man from God, causing man to lose God and His blessing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The soul who sins, he shall die&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 18:4).</p>
<p>Sin causes man to die. All who sin will die. This death involves spiritual death (Eph. 2:5), physical death (Heb. 9:27), and the suffering of the soul in Hades (Luke 16:23-24). Ultimately, the entire person&mdash;spirit and soul and body&mdash;of one who is not forgiven of his sins will be thrown into the lake of fire to suffer for eternity. The Bible calls this death the second death (Rev. 20:12-15).</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:15; see also Rom. 5:12).</p>
<p>When sin is fully grown in man, it brings forth death. Therefore, death comes from sin; it is a result of sin. Regardless of what kind of person we are, death is the result of our sin.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The wages of sin is death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:23).</p>
<p>Death is not merely the result of sin but also the wages of sin. The result of sin relates to the ultimate consequence of sin, whereas the wages of sin relate to the deserving return for sin. Man does not receive death undeservedly. Death is the fair wages for man&rsquo;s sinful work. Man commits sin in his service to sin, and as his master, sin pays people for their work for him. The wages that sin gives to man for his service to sin is death. Death is man&rsquo;s deserved recompense for sinning; it is his fair wage.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;It is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:27).</p>
<p>Sin causes man to die, and judgment follows death. Death brings sinners to the point of judgment. Those who sin die, and those who die are judged.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Were judged...cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:12, 15).</p>
<p>The result of the future judgment upon sinners is to be cast into the lake of fire to be punished for eternity. Eternal perdition is the final result of sin. Sin brings in death, death leads to judgment, and judgment is connected to eternal perdition. Sin, death, judgment, and eternal perdition are like four links in a chain. The first link is sin, and the last link is eternal perdition. Man is handcuffed to sin, and if he is not freed from sin, it will ultimately bring him into eternal perdition. The first two links in this chain, sin and death, are experiences in this age. Sin and death are part of this life, and all people acknowledge their existence. The final two links in this chain, judgment and eternal perdition, occur after death. They cannot be seen in this life, and therefore, some refuse to acknowledge the possibility of their existence. However, just as the first two links&mdash;sin and death&mdash;are real, the final two links&mdash;judgment and eternal perdition&mdash;are real, regardless of whether or not people acknowledge them. Sooner or later everyone who does not believe will experience every link in this chain because he is handcuffed to sin. As long as a person is chained to sin, he cannot escape from death in this age or from judgment and eternal perdition after death.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SOLUTION TO SIN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Record of Sin Being Dealt with<br />
by Christ&rsquo;s Redemption</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:29).</p>
<p>We have been redeemed from our sins by the death of Christ. In order to deal with our record of sins and our sinful nature, Christ carried our sins to the cross and bore God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on our behalf as the Lamb of God. On the cross He bore all the righteous requirements of God, which were upon us as sinners. Thus, He dealt with our record of sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:26).</p>
<p>Christ offered Himself on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins to put away our sins and to deal with our record of sin.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;This One, having offered one sacrifice for sins&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:12).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s offering was an eternal sacrifice for our sins. He solved the problem of our sins forever.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Through His own blood, entered once for all... obtaining an eternal redemption&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:12).</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s sacrifice was an eternal sacrifice. Therefore, He obtained an eternal redemption for us. His one act solved the problem of our sins for eternity. He solved our problem of sin once for all.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Solution to Our Inward Sin</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:3).</p>
<p>We have sin inwardly and sins outwardly; therefore, when the Lord Jesus dealt with sin, He had to deal with both aspects. To deal with our sinful nature, the Lord became flesh, coming in the likeness of the flesh of sin. He put on the flesh of sinners, which means that He put on us sinners in order to deal with our sinful nature. He was crucified for us sinners, and in His flesh He condemned sin within our flesh. Thus, He resolved the problem of our inward sinful nature, the sin dwelling and reigning within us, which enslaved us. The indwelling sin in us is in our flesh. To deal with this aspect, the Lord became flesh and put on the likeness of the flesh of sin. Then He went to the cross to condemn, judge, kill, and abolish sin in the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus did not know sin, but God sent Him in the likeness of the flesh of sin to deal with the problem of sin in the flesh. In God&rsquo;s eyes He was made sin. As a result of being made sin, He could go to the cross to kill and deal with the flesh of sin. When the Lord Jesus was in the flesh on the cross, God saw sin there, and then He condemned and judged it. When Jesus was in the flesh, He had the likeness of the flesh of sin outwardly but not the reality of sin inwardly. When He was judged by God on the cross, He was in the likeness of the flesh of sin in order to deal with sin in the flesh. This is typified by the experience of the Israelites in the wilderness in Numbers 21:4-9. They were bitten by poisonous serpents, and in God&rsquo;s eyes the Israelites were like snakes. God then told Moses to lift up a bronze serpent on a pole to bear His judgment for them and to deal with the poison that had been injected into the Israelites. The bronze serpent had only the outward form of a serpent, not its inward reality. The Lord is like the bronze serpent. On the cross He bore God&rsquo;s judgment for us and dealt with the inward poison of the old serpent, the Devil (Rev. 12:9), that is, the sin in our flesh. The Lord dealt with our inward sin through the death of His flesh on the cross so that we might escape the control of sin and no longer be its slaves.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Solution to Our Outward Sins</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 53:6).</p>
<p>The Lord not only became sin for us in order to deal with our inward sin, but He also bore our iniquities on the cross in order to deal with our outward sins. When He was dying on the cross, God caused all of our iniquities, our outward sins, to fall on Him. He bore our sins and also bore God&rsquo;s righteous judgment on our behalf in order to solve the problem of our outward sins.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
<p>God put all our sins onto the Lord when He was hanging on the tree, the cross. He bore up our sins and solved the problem related to our outward sins before God.</p>
<p>The Lord not only solved the problem of our sinful nature on the cross but also the problem related to the sins which issued forth from our sinful nature. He solved the problem of our sinful nature by becoming sin for us and by condemning and judging sin in the flesh. He solved the problem of our outward sins by bearing our sins and by bearing God&rsquo;s righteous judgment for these sins in order to satisfy His righteous requirement.</p><h2 class="head2">Sin Itself Being Sent Back to the Devil<br />
for Him to Bear</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The goat on which the lot for Azazel fell shall be made to stand alive before Jehovah to make expiation over it, that it may be sent away for Azazel into the wilderness&rdquo;; &ldquo;Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel and all their transgressions, even all their sins; and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall send it away into the wilderness...Thus the goat shall bear away all their iniquities on itself to a solitary land&rdquo;</strong> (Lev. 16:10, 21-22).</p>
<p>Christ solved the problem of our sinful record by bearing our sin in His body, but sin itself was sent back to the devil for him to bear forever. When Christ dealt with our sin, He did not place our sin on us for us to bear. Since sin comes from the devil, originates with him, and was passed on to us, it should be sent back to him for him to bear. God wants the devil to be responsible for sin. This can be seen in the type of the sin offerings made on the Day of Expiation in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>On the Day of Expiation, God commanded the children of Israel to use two goats to expiate their sins. One goat was killed as an offering to God, and the other was sent alive into the wilderness for Azazel. The goat that was killed and offered to God typifies Christ being killed for us, redeeming us from our sins, and being offered to God. The living goat being sent into the wilderness for Azazel signifies that Christ, through the efficacy of the cross, sent sin back to the devil, Azazel, who is the source, the origin, of sin. The goat was sent back to Azazel, who typifies the devil. Since the goat was sent to the devil, it did not need to be killed; rather, it was sent back to its source in the wilderness, which is the place where the devil is, and it will be with the devil forever in the lake of fire. The goat that was killed bore the sins of the children of Israel before God to deal with their sinful record before God. It had to be killed and its blood shed in order to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness to redeem them from their sins. The living goat then took the sin of the children of Israel back to its source. When the high priest, who represented the people, laid his hands on the head of this goat, he confessed the sins and transgressions of the people in order to place them onto this goat. The sins and transgressions of the children of Israel were put on the goat so that it could carry them into the wilderness to the devil, who is against God. On the one hand, our sinful record was resolved before God by Christ, who died and shed His blood for us, according to God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, and on the other hand, sin itself was given back to its source, the devil, for him to bear forever. Christ redeemed us from our sinful record before God through His death and through the shedding of His blood to accomplish redemption according to His righteous requirement. We are no longer condemned before God or enslaved to sin. Through the efficacy of the cross, our sins were also sent back to the devil. We no longer need to carry our sins or be burdened with sin. God&rsquo;s way of dealing with sin is surely complete! We should worship and thank Him. We should receive the redemption that Christ accomplished for us to escape condemnation and to be released from our sins, and we no longer need to bear the sin that the devil put into our being. Since Christ accomplished redemption for us, we should not continue to be companions of the devil, bearing sin. We should let him bear the sin that comes from him. Those who are unwilling to receive Christ&rsquo;s redemption will be the devil&rsquo;s companions and will be forced to help him bear sin for eternity.</p>

<p>Now we need to consider two distinctly different matters: death and resurrection. The Bible often speaks of death and resurrection as being opposite to each other. First Corinthians 15:22 says, &ldquo;Just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.&rdquo; Just as Adam and Christ are opposites, death and resurrection are opposites. Adam gives us sin, and the result of sin is death. Christ gives us righteousness, and the result of righteousness is life, or resurrection (Rom. 5:17). These two are the exact opposites of the other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEATH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Origin of Death</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through sin, death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:12).</p>
<p>The Bible clearly tells us that death entered into the world through sin. If there were no sin in the universe, there would be no death, but since there is sin in the universe, there is death. The origin of death is sin. This chapter and the preceding chapter are related because death comes through sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:15).</p>
<p>Death is produced from sin. When sin is fully grown, it brings forth death. Thus, death comes through sin; it is the result of sin. Sin is the origin of death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Where, O death, is your sting? The sting of death is sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:55-56).</p>
<p>Sin is the sting of death. Just as we use a fishhook to catch fish, death uses sin as a stinging hook to catch people. Once a person touches sin, he is hooked by death, poisoned by death&rsquo;s sting, and unable to escape death. In order to escape from death, one must escape from sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Might of Death</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Death reigned...even over those who had not sinned after the likeness of Adam&rsquo;s transgression&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:14).</p>
<p>Death has might because it can reign over man. Adam and all his descendants are under the might of death and are controlled by death. No one can escape death; death reigns over all the descendants of Adam because of his transgression. Death has the might to control us (v. 17).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Where, O death, is your victory?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:55).</p>
<p>Song of Songs 8:6 portrays death as being something exceedingly strong. Therefore, the might of death is strong; it has the ability to be victorious. According to the Bible, nothing in the universe other than the resurrection of the Lord Jesus can defeat the victorious might of death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Him who has the might of death, that is, the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>The devil has the might of death in his hands. He works out death in everyone through sin, and he exercises the might of death in everyone because of the presence of sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Death</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, there are at least four aspects related to the suffering of death, which speak of the meaning of death.</p><h2 class="head3">The Death of the Spirit</h2>
<p>The first suffering of death is related to the death of the spirit. Originally, the human spirit was living. Just as our ears can understand and contact sound and our eyes can differentiate and contact color, the human spirit can know and understand matters concerning God and fellowship with God. However, man&rsquo;s spirit was deadened, and it lost the function and blessing of knowing and contacting God. This suffering can be compared to the experience of a deaf person who is unable to hear or a blind person who is unable to see.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In the day that you eat of it you shall surely die&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 2:17).</p>
<p>God told Adam that he would die in the day that he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But when Adam ate of the fruit, he did not die outwardly. Therefore, God&rsquo;s word must have referred to the deadening of his spirit. When he disobeyed God&rsquo;s commandment, the function of his human spirit died, cutting him off from God and causing him to lose the blessing and ability of knowing God, contacting God, and fellowshipping with God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Let the dead bury their own dead&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 8:22).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of two kinds of dead people. The first are dead in the spirit but not in body, and the second are dead in both spirit and body. Therefore, the first kind can bury the second. Even though the first can bury those who are physically dead, they themselves are still dead because their spirit is dead in its function of contacting and fellowshipping with God. Although the outward body is living, the inward spirit is dead. Hence, both kinds of people are dead in God&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Has passed out of death into life...The dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:24-25).</p>
<p>Every person who does not believe is dead and is in death because his spirit is dead, having been cut off from God and being unable to contact and fellowship with God. When such a one hears the voice of the Son of God, the gospel that gives life, his spirit is made alive, and he is able to contact God in fellowship. Thus, he passes out of death into life.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;This son of mine was dead and lives again&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 15:24, see also v. 32).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes every person who is saved was dead prior to salvation. On the day of his salvation he is enlivened, and God no longer considers such a one as being dead but rather as living again. After salvation, God sees every believer as being alive again.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Dead in your offenses and sins&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:1, see also v. 5; 4:18; Col. 2:13).</p>
<p>Every saved one was once dead in offenses and sins. This death is a spiritual death. Because of our sins and offenses before God, our spirit was dead toward God, and we were cut off from God. With regard to our spirit, we were dead and unable to contact God or fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>All the verses in this section refer to death as it relates to the human spirit. First John 3:14 and 1 Timothy 5:6 also refer to this aspect of death. Every unsaved descendant of Adam, whether high or low, great or small, wise or foolish, weak or strong, is dead in his spirit, cut off from God, and unable to fellowship with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Death of the Body</h2>
<p>The second aspect related to the suffering of death is the physical death of the body. This aspect of death is what is commonly referred to as death. This aspect of death is apparent and can be seen outwardly.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Adam...died&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 5:5).</p>
<p>This verse refers to the death of Adam&rsquo;s body. His spirit died when he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, but his body died more than nine hundred years later.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The rich man also died and was buried&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:22).</p>
<p>This verse refers to the death of the rich man&rsquo;s body. Even though his spirit was deadened, his physical body needed to be buried when his body died.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;It is reserved for men to die once&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:27).</p>
<p><em>To die once</em> refers to the death of the body. It is reserved for men to physically die once. This aspect of death is reserved for all men.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Suffering of the Soul and the Spirit<br />
in the Flames of Hades</h2>
<p>The third aspect related to the suffering of death is the suffering of the soul and the spirit in the flames of Hades after the death of the body. This suffering is mainly experienced in the soul.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment&rdquo;; &ldquo;I am in anguish in this flame&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:23-24, see also v. 28).</p>
<p>This portion refers to the rich man suffering in the flames of Hades. According to the context of the verses, this occurred after his body died, and it shows that after the death of the body, the soul and spirit are in terrible anguish in the flames of Hades. Hades is not hell but merely the preface to hell, just as a book has a preface. The coming lake of fire is hell. Hades only has flames, but the hell of the lake of fire has fire. No one knows how much more severe the lake of fire will be than the flames of Hades. Since those in the flames of Hades experience terrible anguish, surely there will be considerable suffering in the lake of fire!</p><h2 class="head3">The Spirit, Soul, and Body<br />
Being Thrown into the Lake of Fire&mdash;<br />
the Second Death</h2>
<p>The fourth aspect related to the suffering of death is that of the entire person&mdash;spirit and soul and body&mdash;being thrown into the lake of fire to suffer for eternity. This is what the Bible refers to as the second death. Man&rsquo;s spirit is dead, then his body dies, and his soul suffers in Hades. These three aspects together comprise the first death. This first death is progressive, starting with death in the spirit, proceeding to death in the body, and culminating with the suffering of death in the soul and spirit in Hades. When the soul and spirit suffer in Hades, the process involving the first death is completed. Strictly speaking, after a person is born, he is not living every day but dying every day. Eventually, his body dies, and his soul suffers in Hades, completing the first death. In the future the spirit and soul will come forth out of Hades, and his body will come out from the earth. The entire person of those who are not saved will be resurrected, pass through God&rsquo;s judgment, and then be thrown into the lake of fire to suffer the second death, which is to suffer in the lake of fire eternally. The suffering of this death is the ultimate suffering of death. The first death is a step-by-step process, but the second death, the death of the entire unsaved person, occurs and consummates at the time of judgment at the great white throne.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:15).</p>
<p>In the future all those who are not saved and whose names are not written in the book of life will be thrown into the lake of fire to perish for eternity.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:8).</p>
<p>All unforgiven sinners, no matter what their sin, will be thrown into the lake of fire. This is the portion that sinners will receive for sinning, and this is the second death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Cast into the lake of fire and brimstone...and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever&rdquo;; &ldquo;He shall be tormented in fire and brimstone...forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:10; 14:10-11).</p>
<p>The unforgiven sinners who perish in the lake of fire will suffer day and night without rest forever and ever. The result of the first death, going to Hades, is temporary and the suffering of its flames less severe than that of the lake of fire. The result of the second death, being cast into the lake of fire, is eternal, and its eternal sufferings are indescribably severe.</p>
<p>Some people say that a person no longer exists and no longer has any feelings when he dies. But this is not the revelation of the Bible! The Bible shows that the soul and spirit of a dead unbeliever is full of a sense of suffering in the flames of Hades (Luke 16:23-28). Moreover, when his entire person&mdash;spirit and soul and body&mdash;is cast into the lake of fire, he will be tormented in fire and brimstone and have no rest day and night forever and ever (Rev. 14:10-11; 20:10, 15; 19:20; 21:8). When the Bible speaks of perishing (John 3:16), it does not mean the end of existence, because this same word is translated &ldquo;ruined&rdquo; in Matthew 9:17 and Mark 2:22, where the wineskins are ruined and lose their original usefulness. In Matthew 10:6 and 15:24 and in Luke 15:4, 32, and 19:10 this same word is also translated as &ldquo;lost,&rdquo; referring to the house of Israel, sheep, the prodigal son, and sinners. Although they are lost, they continue to exist.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Victory over Death<br />
Enjoyed by Believers in Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ died for us&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:8).</p>
<p>Believers in Christ have conquered death, even though death is strong, has might, and its sufferings are numerous and terrible. However, death cannot harm or control the believers in Christ. Believers overcome death because Christ died for us. Therefore, death has no position in us and cannot harm or control us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;One died for all, therefore all died&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:14).</p>
<p>Christ died for us all. In God&rsquo;s eyes, we have already died in Christ. In Christ we have left death behind and conquered death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;By the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:9).</p>
<p>In His death Christ tasted death on our behalf. When Christ died on the cross, He tasted all the sufferings mentioned above on our behalf. Christ received the portion that we should have received. Christ drank the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath for us. Therefore, we no longer have to taste the suffering of death. We can leave death behind, having conquered it, because Christ tasted everything of death on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil, and might release those who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:14-15).</p>
<p>People fear death, and because they fear death, they are slaves to death and under its control. This is the result of the devil&rsquo;s exercising the might of death upon people. Christ, however, destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil, on the cross and released us who because of the fear of death were held in slavery to death and to the devil. The death of Christ released us from the might of death and enabled us to leave behind the authority of death and to conquer it.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:10).</p>
<p>Through His death on the cross, Christ destroyed him who has the might of death, the devil, and nullified death itself. Furthermore, He resurrected, bringing life and incorruption to light. Therefore, we not only leave death behind through His death-destroying death but also overcome death by His incorruptible life.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Has passed out of death into life...Those who hear will live&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:24-25).</p>
<p>Christ died for us, tasted death on our behalf, destroyed him who has the might of death, and nullified death itself; therefore, once we hear the gospel and receive Him through believing, our spirit is enlivened, and we pass out of death into life. We escape death and enter life.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:5; see also Col. 2:13).</p>
<p>Originally, we were dead in spirit because of our offenses, but when we received His life, God made us alive together with Christ through His Spirit. Our dead spirit was enlivened. Thus, in our spirit we can escape death and live before God.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;He who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live; and everyone who lives and believes into Me shall by no means die forever&rdquo;</strong> (John 11:25-26).</p>
<p>The believers who are alive when the Lord returns have the possibility of never dying. But even if we do not live until He comes, we will be resurrected when He comes. Since He resolved all our problems with death, death can no longer control or hold us.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Those who...have fallen asleep through Jesus...will rise first&rdquo;; &ldquo;The dead will be raised incorruptible, and we will be changed...Then the word which is written will come to pass, &lsquo;Death has been swallowed up unto victory&rsquo;&rdquo;; &ldquo;May be swallowed up by life&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:14, 16; 1 Cor. 15:52, 54; 2 Cor. 5:4).</p>
<p>Because we have received Christ, our spirits have been made alive with His life. Although our bodies are still under death, we will escape death completely when Christ returns, and we will fully enter into the life of Christ. The dead believers will be raised from the dead, and those who are living will be changed. All believers will escape death completely. Every aspect of death in a believer, from spirit to body, will be swallowed up by life. Then in Christ we will overcome death completely. Through Christ&rsquo;s first coming with our believing into Him, our spirit passed out of death into life. When He comes a second time, our body will pass out of death into life. By His two &ldquo;comings,&rdquo; we will completely escape death and overcome it.</p><h2 class="head2">The Enmity between Death and God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Death, the last enemy, is being abolished&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:26).</p>
<p>Death is allied with the devil. Since the devil is God&rsquo;s enemy, death is also God&rsquo;s enemy. Death is the last enemy that God will abolish.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The End Result of Death Itself</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:14).</p>
<p>God will deal with death in the same way that He will deal with the devil. The devil&rsquo;s end is to be cast into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:10). The end result of death is also to be cast into the lake of fire. Death and the devil share the same destiny. This is also the end of Hades, the &ldquo;co-worker&rdquo; of death.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A new heaven and a new earth...Death will be no more&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:1, 4)</p>
<p>Death is thrown into the lake of fire at the end of the millennial kingdom. In the new heaven and new earth, there will be no more death. God not only works to help us escape from and overcome death; He also works to drive out death from the realm of His authority. Since God is the God of life and the God of resurrection, He and death cannot exist together. When God destroys death, the new heaven and new earth, the realm where God eternally exercises His authority, will be brought in.</p>
<p>This is the story of death. Now let us look at resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RESURRECTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Source of Resurrection</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jesus said...I am the resurrection&rdquo;</strong> (John 11:25).</p>
<p>Since the Lord is resurrection, He is the source of resurrection. Death is related to the devil, but resurrection is related to the Lord. Since the Lord is the embodiment of God, God is resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;God...who gives life to the dead&rdquo;<strong> (Rom. 4:17).</p>
<p>The God who gives life to the dead is the source of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Power of Resurrection</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The power of His resurrection&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>Since resurrection comes out of God and is the Lord Himself, it is as powerful as God. The power of resurrection is God Himself. Nothing can resist resurrection, just as nothing can resist the power of God. Although death is strong, it is not stronger than resurrection. Only resurrection can resist death; resurrection looses the pangs of death (Acts 2:24), overcomes death, destroys death, and swallows up death (1 Cor. 15:52-54).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The surpassing greatness of His power...which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead...far above all&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:19-21).</p>
<p>The surpassingly great power with which God raised Christ from the dead is the resurrection power. By this power we not only overcome death, but we are also far above all. Nothing can limit this power or hold this power down.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Importance of Resurrection</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has Christ been raised...Your faith is futile; you are still in your sins. Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished...If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:13, 17-18, 32).</p>
<p>There is death in the universe, but there is also resurrection. Death is of the devil, whereas resurrection is of God. Death is the devil&rsquo;s torment for man, whereas resurrection is God&rsquo;s salvation for man. Without resurrection there would be no salvation for men. Without resurrection Christ would not have been raised, and if Christ was not raised, our faith in Him would be futile. Without resurrection we could not be saved, and we would still be in our sins under death; even those who died in Christ would perish eternally. Without resurrection we would have no hope, and we would be under the control of death, waiting for the final coming of death. Without resurrection our life here would have no meaning. The most we could do would be to eat, drink, and play, frittering our lives away in a drunken stupor since we could die tomorrow and enter into eternal nothingness. Without resurrection we would have no salvation today and no hope for the future; we would be of all men most miserable. However, since Christ rose from the dead and resurrection will come, our salvation today is solid and our future hope is reliable.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Concerning the resurrection of the dead...He is not the God of the dead, but of the living&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 22:31-32).</p>
<p>Resurrection is essential not only to us but also to God Himself. God is a God of life; He cannot tolerate death nor be the God of the dead. He can be the God only of the living. Through resurrection God deals with and overcomes the death which was injected into His people by His enemy, the devil. With resurrection He can be our God and come into us as God. If He could not deal with death through resurrection, He could be God only in Himself; He would not be able to come into us. God must resurrect us and eliminate the death in our being through resurrection because He desires to be in us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Resurrection</h2>
<p>Just as death includes several aspects in regard to its meaning, there are several aspects of resurrection in regard to its meaning.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Resurrection of Our Spirit</h2>
<p>The first item included in death is the death of the spirit, and the first item included in resurrection is the resurrection of the spirit. An understanding of this aspect of resurrection involves a distinction between fact and experience.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Raised us up together with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:6).</p>
<p>When God raised Christ from the dead, He raised us up together with Him. This is a fact related to the resurrection of our spirit. Our spirit was resurrected based on our union with Christ in His resurrection. In addition to Ephesians 2:6, several other verses speak of the fact of our union with Christ in resurrection, including Colossians 2:12 and 3:1, Romans 6:4-5 and 8, and John 14:19.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:5).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of the experience of our spirit being resurrected. This experience is based on the fact that we were raised up together with Christ. Prior to believing, our spirit was deadened, and it had lost its function before God because of our offenses. However, when we believed in Christ and received Him, God enlivened our deadened spirit based on the fact that we were raised up together with Christ. Our spirit&rsquo;s function toward God was revived at the time of our regeneration. Colossians 2:13, John 5:25, and Luke 15:24 and 32 also speak of this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Resurrection of Our Body</h2>
<p>The second item included in the meaning of death is the death of the body; the second item included in the meaning of resurrection is the resurrection of our body. When a believer is saved and regenerated, his spirit is resurrected, but the body of a believer will not be resurrected until later.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All in the tombs...will come forth...to the resurrection&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:28-29).</p>
<p>The resurrection spoken of in this verse is related to the body, not the spirit, because it speaks of all in the tombs coming forth to the resurrection. Resurrection out of the tombs is the resurrection of the body.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;How are the dead raised?...What you sow is not made alive unless it dies...So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:35-36, 42).</p>
<p>These verses speak of the resurrection of a believer&rsquo;s body. Many think that resurrection is vague and implausible. Ten years ago I met a college student. He said that he believed in Christ but could not believe in resurrection. I pointed out the window to the wheat fields and said to him, &ldquo;Look at these lush fields of wheat! How do they grow out of the ground? Do they not come out in resurrection? The grains of wheat fall into the ground and die, then something grows out of the ground in resurrection. The possibility of our resurrection seems to be quite vague, but the principle of resurrection can be seen in all living things, both plants and animals. An egg breaks, and a baby chicken is born. A seed decays, and a flower sprouts up. These are pictures of resurrection. There are too many examples like this in the field of biology!&rdquo; When the college student heard this word, he realized that resurrection was quite logical. He admired my examples and explanation, but I did not think of them myself; they come from the Bible. The Bible says that if what we sow does not die, it cannot be made alive, but if it dies, it can be made alive. Furthermore, the body of resurrection is superior to the body that is planted. The resurrection of a dead believer follows this pattern. Those who die will live again; they will be resurrected. Furthermore, what is planted in death is a corruptible, shameful, weak, fleshly body, but what comes out in resurrection is an incorruptible, glorious, strong, spiritual body. Thus, this reference to resurrection in the future emphasizes the resurrection of the body, which is practical and real.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Order of Resurrection</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All will be made alive. But each one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ; then those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming; then the end&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22-24).</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s plan and arrangement the resurrection of the dead has an order. Each one is resurrected in his turn. The first is Christ. He was the first to resurrect from the dead, so He is the firstfruits of resurrection. This has been accomplished. Next, the saints who belong to Christ and who have died will resurrect when the Lord returns before the millennial kingdom. Finally, at the end of the millennial kingdom the unsaved who have died will resurrect. Generally speaking, resurrection can be divided into three groups, but there are some exceptional occurrences of resurrection, such as the resurrection of the two witnesses (Rev. 11:3-12).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;An hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice and will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:28-29).</p>
<p>All those in tombs, whether they are believers or unbelievers, will hear the voice of the Son of God and be resurrected. However, the time and nature of their resurrection will differ. The first to be resurrected will be the saints who have done good; they will come forth to the resurrection of life. Those who are raised first will obtain life. The second will be the unsaved who have practiced evil; they will come forth later to the resurrection of judgment. Those who are raised later will receive judgment. The resurrected saints will receive life, so their resurrection is called the resurrection of life. This will occur before the millennial kingdom. The resurrected unbelievers will receive judgment, so their resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment. This will occur after the millennial kingdom. These two resurrections are different in nature and in time. One is to life, and the other is to judgment; one is before the millennial kingdom, and the other is after. They will be one thousand years apart.</p>
<p>The preceding two points concerning the order of resurrection are a general outline. Now let us analyze them more closely.</p><h2 class="head3">The Resurrection of Christ the Firstfruits</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;On the first day of the week&rdquo;; &ldquo;The day after the Sabbath&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 16:9; Lev. 23:11).</p>
<p>The resurrection of the firstfruits was on the first day of the week, which was the day after the Sabbath in the Old Testament, as recorded in Leviticus 23:10-11. It occurred on what the New Testament calls the Lord&rsquo;s Day (Rev. 1:10).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:23).</p>
<p>The person who was raised as the firstfruits was Christ. According to the record of the Bible, many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were also raised after His resurrection (Matt. 27:52-53). This is according to the Old Testament type concerning this matter that points not to one grain but to one sheaf (Lev. 23:10-11), which exactly corresponds with the facts related to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Firstborn from the dead&rdquo;; &ldquo;Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies...and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:18; Eph. 1:20, 22-23).</p>
<p>In the resurrection of the firstfruits Christ became the Firstborn from the dead. He was the first to resurrect from the dead, so He is the firstfruits of the resurrected ones. Moreover, in resurrection Christ ascended far above all and became Head over all things to the church. He was made the Head of all.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Resurrection of the Saints<br />
Being the Resurrection of Life and<br />
the Resurrection from the Dead</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;At His coming&rdquo;; &ldquo;At the last trumpet&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:23, 52).</p>
<p>The first resurrection is the resurrection that gives life. This resurrection is not only from death but also from among the dead. This resurrection not only enables people to escape from death but also from the dead. In this resurrection only a small number of the dead are raised, which differentiates them from the other dead. This will occur when Christ comes back before the millennial kingdom at the time of the last trumpet.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Those who are Christ&rsquo;s&rdquo;; &ldquo;The dead in Christ will rise first&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:23; 1 Thes. 4:16; see also John 6:39-40, 44, 54; 11:25).</p>
<p>Those who will participate in the first resurrection are the dead saints. When the last trumpet sounds and the Lord returns, the dead saints from all the ages will be resurrected from among the dead.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The resurrection of life&rdquo;; &ldquo;Raised incorruptible&rdquo;; &ldquo;The dead in Christ will rise first...Be caught up together...and thus we will be always with the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:29; 1 Cor. 15:52; 1 Thes. 4:16-17).</p>
<p>The first resurrection is the resurrection of life. All who participate in the first resurrection will enter into life with incorruptible bodies. They will be caught up to the air and will always be with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Resurrection of the Overcoming Saints</h2>
<p>In every age there are a few overcoming saints. Although they will be resurrected at the same time as the other saints, they will have an out-resurrection, a better resurrection, the top resurrection. This can be illustrated by students at a graduation ceremony. The top three students graduate at the same time as the other students, but their graduation is a special graduation, a graduation with a reward, a graduation with honors. The resurrection of the overcoming saints will come with a special and glorious reward. We need to look at the portions in the Bible that speak of this.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You will rest and rise again in your lot at the end of the days&rdquo;</strong> (Dan. 12:13).</p>
<p>Daniel was an overcomer in a time of desolation. This verse speaks of his rising again in his lot, meaning that he will not only rise again but will also enjoy the lot, the special blessing, that God has prepared for him. Therefore, his resurrection will be a resurrection with a glorious reward.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;It will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 14:14).</p>
<p>Some will be repaid in the resurrection of the righteous. This means that they will receive a repayment in addition to resurrection. Therefore, their resurrection must also be a resurrection with a glorious reward.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Those who are counted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 20:35).</p>
<p>Some are counted worthy to obtain the future age in the resurrection from the dead. This shows that they are not only resurrected from the dead but that they are separated from the rest to obtain the future age. This means that they will be kings in the future age, ruling over this world. Therefore, their resurrection will be a glorious resurrection of reward.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;That they might obtain a better resurrection&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 11:35).</p>
<p>The resurrection given to some is a better resurrection. This means that their resurrection will be different from ordinary resurrection. In this resurrection some will obtain a reward and glory.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:11).</p>
<p>This word concerning the out-resurrection was spoken by the apostle Paul. According to the context of the preceding verses in Philippians, this out-resurrection is something that will be attained and obtained by those who give up everything, suffer with the Lord, strive to pursue His reward, endeavor to run in the Lord&rsquo;s way, and are martyred for Him. Therefore, the out-resurrection is different from the resurrection that Paul speaks of in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. There he speaks of the resurrection of all believers; here he speaks of a resurrection in which only those saints who are martyred for the Lord and who overcome can participate. First Thessalonians speaks of a general, ordinary resurrection; Philippians speaks of a special, out-resurrection. According to the word in 1 Thessalonians, the apostle Paul is certain that he would obtain the general, ordinary resurrection, since all who die in Christ participate in this resurrection. But in Philippians 3, the apostle does not have the assurance that he will obtain the special, out-resurrection. He says that he counts all things loss for the Lord, suffers with the Lord, and is being conformed to the Lord&rsquo;s death so that perhaps he might attain to the out-resurrection. He does not consider that he has already obtained it. He continues to strive to pursue it, to run hard in the hope that he would obtain this special resurrection. Only those who are faithful to the Lord unto death can participate in this special out-resurrection. All the saints will be resurrected, but only those who are faithful to the Lord unto death will participate in the out-resurrection. As long as a student passes, he will graduate, but only the top students in the class will graduate with honors. Although other students graduate, they will not receive a prize or obtain honor. Similarly, every dead believer will be resurrected, but not all will receive a resurrection of reward, the out-resurrection. Only those who have overcome will obtain a reward in addition to being resurrected. Therefore, the resurrection that they obtain is a resurrection with a reward; it is a special out-resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years...This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:4-6).</p>
<p>The resurrection referred to here is the first resurrection because it speaks of the resurrection that occurs before the millennial kingdom. It also says that this resurrection is the first (best) resurrection because the ones resurrected are rewarded to reign with Christ. The Greek word translated &ldquo;first&rdquo; is the same word that is used in Luke 15:22 for <em>best</em> in <em>the best robe.</em> The first resurrection is also the best resurrection. Those who have part in the best resurrection will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Christ for a thousand years, ruling over the earth in the millennial kingdom. These are the overcoming saints who bore the Lord&rsquo;s testimony and were martyred for God. They are the only ones who will participate in this resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Resurrection of the Unbelievers<br />
Being the Resurrection of Judgment</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The thousand years were completed&rdquo;; &ldquo;The end&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:5; 1 Cor. 15:24).</p>
<p>The final resurrection is the resurrection that will bring the unbelievers to judgment. The time of this resurrection will be after the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The rest of the dead&rdquo;; &ldquo;The dead, the great and the small&rdquo;; &ldquo;Those who have practiced evil&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:5, 12; John 5:29).</p>
<p>Those people who will be in the final resurrection are the unsaved dead, not the saints. After the millennial kingdom, the dead will be raised to be judged to determine their eternal destiny.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The resurrection of judgment&rdquo;; &ldquo;Standing before the throne...The dead were judged...according to their works&rdquo;; &ldquo;Cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:29; Rev. 20:12, 15).</p>
<p>The people who participate in this final resurrection will be judged and condemned. After they are resurrected, those in the final resurrection will stand (<em>standing</em> signifies that they are living) before the great white throne to be judged according to their works. Then they will be cast into the lake of fire to perish eternally because none of their works will be approved.</p>
<p>All of these points are the story of resurrection.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN</h1>

<li>A comparison of the fifth and sixth judgments.</li>
</ol>
<p>After studying the topics of death and resurrection, we need to consider the topic of judgment. Sin gives birth to death, and death brings in judgment. These topics are interrelated, so we must consider them together.</p>
<p>Judgment is a matter of God&rsquo;s administration. The Bible shows that God executes His judgment according to His righteousness, by His holiness, and for His glory. His judgment is the execution of His government in the universe. The Epistles of Peter speak of God&rsquo;s government and God&rsquo;s kingdom, so they especially speak of God&rsquo;s judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment is an important part of His rule and government. The fact that He judges the devil, the people of the world, and the angels shows that He is the sovereign Lord of the universe with the authority to rule. Without His ruling, there would be no government. God is the Ruler of the universe, so the universe has a government. Since there is a government, there is also judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment is a part of the exercise of His government.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will focus on God&rsquo;s judgment of man. When some look at this matter in a general way, they think that God&rsquo;s judgment concerns only the matter of whether a man will go to heaven or hell. But if we carefully examine what God reveals in the Bible, we will see that this is not the case. The Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s judgment on man that is very particular and that has many distinctions. There are at least six kinds of judgment. Thus, we must spend some time to study God&rsquo;s judgments carefully. This also will help us to understand the Bible and its prophecies.</p>
<p>We will look at the six judgments of God on man according to six different aspects: (1) the time of judgment, (2) the place of judgment, (3) the one who is judging, (4) the ones being judged, (5) the basis for judgment, and (6) the result of judgment. If we clearly see these six aspects with respect to each type of judgment, we will fully understand each of the judgments of God on man. The <a href="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/JudgmentChart.pdf" target="_blank">chart on the following page</a> will be helpful.</p><h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT ON THE CROSS</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, God&rsquo;s first judgment on man was at the cross of Christ. Man&rsquo;s sins were judged by God on the cross so that He could forgive and save man. Without judging man&rsquo;s sins, God, as the Ruler of man, would have no way to forgive or save man. In order for God to forgive and save man, He had to judge man&rsquo;s sins on the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Time&mdash;Approximately A.D. 30</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s judgment upon man at the cross of Christ occurred at the Lord&rsquo;s death in the year A.D. 30 approximately.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Place&mdash;Golgotha</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha, where they crucified Him&rdquo;</strong> (John 19:17-18).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s judgment of man at the cross of Christ occurred at a place called Golgotha in Hebrew, which means &ldquo;skull.&rdquo; <em>Golgotha</em> was translated into Latin as &ldquo;Calvaria&rdquo; and anglicized as &ldquo;Calvary.&rdquo; Golgotha was a small hill outside of Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Judge&mdash;the Righteous God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jehovah was pleased to crush Him, to afflict Him with grief. / When He makes Himself an offering for sin&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 53:10).</p>
<p>The One who judged man at the cross of Christ was the righteous God. God crushed Christ, as the Substitute for man, and afflicted Him with grief as an offering for sin. It was God who judged and punished Christ on His cross. On the one hand, men nailed Christ on the cross to kill Him, but on the other hand, God crushed Christ on the cross and killed Him. According to the record of the Bible, during the first half of Christ&rsquo;s time on the cross, from 9:00 A.M. until 12:00 noon, man was putting Him to death (Mark 15:25-33). During the second half of His time on the cross, from 12:00 noon until 3:00 P.M., God was striking and judging Him. When God forsook Him, darkness fell over all the land (Matt. 27:45-46).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>According to this verse God made Christ, who did not know sin, sin on our behalf. God judged us in Him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 27:46).</p>
<p>Since Christ was our Substitute upon the cross and was struck with God&rsquo;s judgment, God left Him and forsook Him. When Christ was without sin, God was absolutely pleased with Him and never left Him. But when Christ was made sin on our behalf on the cross, God forsook Him. This proves that when God was judging and punishing Him, He considered Christ as our Substitute.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The One Being Judged&mdash;<br />
Christ&mdash;the Believers&rsquo; Substitute</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 3:18).</p>
<p>On the cross Christ was judged by God as the believers&rsquo; Substitute. He suffered on the cross as the Righteous on behalf of us, the unrighteous. He was judged by God for our sins.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>Christ, who did not know sin, was made sin on our behalf on the cross to bear God&rsquo;s judgment in our place.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body on the tree&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
<p>Christ was hung upon the tree; that is, He was crucified on the cross to bear God&rsquo;s judgment for us. Thus, He bore up our sins in His body on the tree.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:13).</p>
<p>On the cross Christ became sin on our behalf, bore up our sins in His body, and was judged by God in our place; therefore, He became a curse on our behalf and was forsaken by God. He was not a martyr because God does not curse or forsake those who are martyred for His name. On the contrary, He is pleased with such ones and will remain with them. However, Christ was cursed by God on the cross and then forsaken by God. This proves that He was not a martyr; rather, He was our Substitute, bearing God&rsquo;s judgment for our sin. As sinners, we should have been judged by God. Without Christ&rsquo;s substitutionary death, we would have had to bear God&rsquo;s judgment for our sins; instead, we were judged in Christ&rsquo;s judgment on the cross on our behalf.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Basis&mdash;<br />
the Righteous Requirement of God&rsquo;s Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The soul who sins, he shall die&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 18:20).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s judgment of us at the cross of Christ was based upon the righteous requirement of His law. God judged Christ on our behalf because He is righteous and we are sinful. The righteousness of His law required Him to judge Christ for us. Without His judgment of Christ, we would have to die and perish eternally; that is, according to the righteous requirements of His law, we would have to die and perish eternally.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:13).</p>
<p>The righteous requirement of God&rsquo;s law is that sinners deserve death; this is related to the curse of the law. This requirement is according to God&rsquo;s righteous condemnation. Because of this requirement, this condemnation, Christ became a curse upon the cross for our sake. Since Christ was cursed for us on the cross according to the righteous requirement of God&rsquo;s law, we were redeemed out of the curse of the law. The judgment upon Christ on the cross satisfied the righteous requirement of God&rsquo;s law. The law cannot place further requirements upon us, nor are we under the curse of the law. Now God can forgive and save us according to His righteousness.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s forgiveness and salvation must be righteously based upon the righteous judgment of His government. If Christ had not borne God&rsquo;s righteous governmental judgment on our behalf and had not satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement on our behalf, God would have had no way to forgive us or save us. Since Christ did all this for us, God can forgive us and save us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Result&mdash;Justifying All Those Who Believe<br />
So That They Would Not Be Judged</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;That we might become the righteousness of God in Him&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:21).</p>
<p>The result of God&rsquo;s judgment of Christ on the cross is that all those who believe into Him are justified by God. God made Christ sin on the cross so that we might become the righteousness of God in Christ. This not only justifies us before God but also makes us the righteousness of God in Christ. We were sin and should have been judged; now we are the righteousness of God in Christ. We are completely justified according to God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. We will no longer be judged by God for our sin, and we are completely pleasing to God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who believes into Him is not condemned&rdquo;; &ldquo;Does not come into judgment&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:18; 5:24).</p>
<p>Since God caused Christ to bear our sins on the cross and to be condemned on our behalf, receiving God&rsquo;s judgment on our behalf, He will not condemn or judge those who have believed into Christ. God cannot condemn or judge us twice, because He is righteous. Since He condemned and judged us in Christ, He cannot condemn or judge us again. Since Christ bore God&rsquo;s righteous judgment for us, fulfilling His righteousness and satisfying His righteous requirement, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, we cannot be judged by Him again. We can no longer be condemned or judged by God for the sins that we committed prior to our salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s second judgment on man is in His church. After Christ bore God&rsquo;s judgment on the cross, He rose from the dead, ascended, and poured out the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit was poured out, the church was produced. From the time of the church&rsquo;s existence, there has been judgment in the church. God&rsquo;s judgment on the cross is one kind of judgment, and His judgment within the church is another kind of judgment.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s judgment in the church is called the judgment of the church because it is carried out through the church on sinning believers. Most people are unaware of this matter, and most believers ignore this matter. This judgment, however, is an important link in God&rsquo;s government, and it is also a part of God&rsquo;s government in the church. If we want to understand God&rsquo;s government and live within the church, we cannot be ignorant of this judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Time&mdash;Whenever Needed</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:2).</p>
<p>The church&rsquo;s judgment against sinning believers occurs whenever it is needed. Whenever there is a sinning believer, the church should judge him without delay. In the early days there was a sinning believer in the church in Corinth, but the church did not judge him. The apostle Paul had to rebuke them for not removing the one who committed the deed of fornication and for not judging him. Whenever there is a sinful believer in the church, the church should judge him without delay.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Place&mdash;within the Local Church</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Be removed from your midst&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:2).</p>
<p>The church&rsquo;s judgment upon sinning believers is within the local church. It does not need to be taken to the apostle or even to another local church. In the early days the apostle commanded the church in Corinth to judge the sinning brother by judging him themselves, that is, by judging him within their own local church. This shows that the judgment of sinning believers is within a local church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Judge&mdash;the Local Church</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do you not judge those who are within the church?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:12).</p>
<p>The apostle told the church in Corinth to judge the sinning brother among them. Therefore, concerning the judgment of sinning believers, the church that judges is the local church. This judgment is carried out by the local church. It is not carried out by the apostle, by other people, or by another group.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The One Being Judged&mdash;a Believer Who Commits a Blatant Sin and Refuses to Repent</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Now I have written to you not to mingle with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one not even to eat&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:11).</p>
<p>When the church judges sinning believers, the church judges believers who commit blatant sins and refuse to repent. The apostle spoke of those who are called brothers (in the house of God even sisters are brothers) being fornicators, covetous, idolaters, revilers, or being drunken or rapacious. With such ones we are not even to eat. This is to judge and separate ourselves from them. The six sins that the apostle lists are very offensive to God and man. They are blatant and immoral. With the exception of idolatry, even unbelieving Gentiles condemn these sins. Therefore, any brother or sister who commits any of these sins and who refuses to repent should be judged by the church and removed from the church. The church must judge such a one by removing him in order to avoid corruption inwardly and to care for the church&rsquo;s name outwardly.</p><h2 class="head2">The Basis&mdash;Blatant Sin</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:11).</p>
<p>The church&rsquo;s judgment of sinning believers is based on blatant sins committed by a believer. It is based on the six blatant, gross sins listed by the apostle in 1 Corinthians 5. The basis for the church to judge believers is related to their committing any of these blatant, gross sins and refusing to repent and deal with them. However, there must be strong evidence that the believer committed a blatant sin. Judgment cannot be based on conjecture.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Result&mdash;Being Removed from the Church&mdash;<br />
Cut Off from Fellowship</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Remove the evil man from among yourselves&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:13, see also v. 2).</p>
<p>The result of the church&rsquo;s judgment on a sinning believer is to remove the sinning and unrepentant believer from the church and to cut off his fellowship with the church. This prevents the church from being corrupted, defiled, involved in the sin, and thus being brought low. God gave the church authority to judge a sinning believer because He wants the church to preserve itself in holiness. If the church could be contaminated by a sinning believer, the church should surely judge and remove him. Such a one should not be allowed to remain in the fellowship of the church.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Not to mingle...with such a one not even to eat&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 5:11).</p>
<p>The church judges a sinning believer by removing him from the church, that is, by causing him to be cut off from the fellowship of the church so that he may not mingle with the brothers and sisters, not even to eat with them. On the one hand, this prevents other brothers and sisters from being corrupted by the sinning believer and the church from being defiled. On the other hand, it is a punishment and a discipline to the sinning believer that causes him to suffer, be unhappy, repent, and return. It is not an eternal rejection, which results in his perishing, but a temporary punishment and discipline that causes him to repent. If a believer who is removed repents, the church should forgive him and receive him back in love. This is according to the apostle&rsquo;s word to the church in Corinth (2 Cor. 2:6-8).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S DISCIPLINE</h2>
<p>Another exercise of God&rsquo;s judgment is His judgment of discipline on the believers. Although God wants the church to judge and discipline the believers, there are many problems in the believers that the church cannot touch. For example, a brother might constantly quarrel with his wife, or a sister might frequently lose her temper with her husband. These are not gross, blatant sins like adultery, nor are they the sins spoken of in 1 Corinthians 5, so the church cannot judge and deal with them. Instead, God will reach out His hand to discipline and deal with them. God&rsquo;s discipline of the believers is a third kind of judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Time&mdash;Any Time</h2>
<p>God can exercise the judgment of His discipline on the believers at any time. Whenever God thinks that a believer has a need, He exercises His disciplining judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Place&mdash;Any Place</h2>
<p>The judgment of God&rsquo;s discipline on the believers can occur at any time and in any place. If God thinks it necessary and appropriate, He will exercise the judgment of His discipline.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Judge&mdash;the Father God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;&lsquo;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives.&rsquo; It is for discipline that you endure; God deals with you as with sons. For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:6-7).</p>
<p>In His judgment of discipline on the believers, God is the Judge. The believers are the children of God, and God is our Father. All fathers discipline their children. As our Father, God also disciplines. His discipline is proof that He accepts us as His children. Therefore, this judgment is a matter of God&rsquo;s governmental administration within His household.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ones Being Judged&mdash;the Believers Who Sin and Do Not Judge Themselves</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged. But being judged by the Lord, we are disciplined&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 11:31-32).</p>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment of the believers is focused on the believers, the ones being judged are believers. However, if we discern ourselves first, that is, if we judge ourselves first, we can avoid this disciplinary judgment from God. If we have sinned and do not judge ourselves, God will discipline us by judging us so that we will be corrected by Him to leave our sin.</p><h2 class="head2">The Basis&mdash;the Father&rsquo;s Love and Good Pleasure</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;What son is there whom the father does not discipline?&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:7).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment on the believers is based upon His love. He disciplines not only because He is our Father but also because He loves us. He is not simply our Father; He is our loving Father. He must discipline us because He loves us. What children are loved by their father but are not disciplined by their father? God disciplines us not because He dislikes us but because He loves us. He strikes us in discipline because He loves us. Therefore, God&rsquo;s love for us as our Father is the basis of His disciplinary judgment upon us. For this reason, God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment can be considered His loving discipline, His loving judgment.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;For what is profitable&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:10).</p>
<p>On the one hand, God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment on the believers is based upon His love, and on the other hand, it is also based upon His good pleasure toward us. Hebrews 12:10 says that God disciplines us, judges us, for our profit. His good pleasure for us causes Him to think about our profit and to discipline us. Whatever comes to us through His disciplinary judgment is out of the arrangement and exercise of His good pleasure toward us. Thus, His good pleasure toward us is also a basis for Him to judge us in His discipline.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Result&mdash;Profiting the Believers Lest They<br />
Be Condemned Together with the World</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;For what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness...It yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:10-11).</p>
<p>The judgment of God&rsquo;s discipline of the believers results in profit for the believers by causing them to partake of His holiness and to bear the peaceable fruit of righteousness. Believers should be separated from the world and live a holy life that matches God&rsquo;s holy nature. Our behavior and actions should match God&rsquo;s righteousness, and we should be harmonious and peaceable toward God and man. However, we often do not live like this after we are saved; instead, we continue to mingle with the world. Our living often does not match God&rsquo;s holy nature, and our behavior does not match God&rsquo;s righteous procedures. We have problems and strife with God and man. This forces God to discipline and punish us. Every time we pass through God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment, however, we come out of the world a little more. This makes our living more in accord with God&rsquo;s holy nature and our behavior more in accord with God&rsquo;s righteous ways. It brings us into more harmony and peace with God and man. If everything in our life were easy, if we were healthy, if things went smoothly, if we did not have God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment, it would be very easy for us to be in the world. It would be easy for us to be loose and to have problems with God and man. But when God disciplines us, we must leave these conditions because God causes us to partake of His holy nature and to match His righteous ways. We also have more peaceable fruit. These are the result of God&rsquo;s exercising His disciplinary judgment.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;That we may not be condemned with the world&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 11:32).</p>
<p>The result of God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment upon the believers is not merely to profit us but also to cause us to escape from being condemned with the world. God will judge all sinners, and God cannot avoid judging man&rsquo;s sinful actions because He is righteous. However, God does not want His children to be condemned and judged with the world. Therefore, before God judges the world, He will exercise His discipline to punish and judge His children, as indicated in 1 Peter 4:17, which says that God&rsquo;s judgment begins &ldquo;from the house of God.&rdquo; This is typified by both God&rsquo;s judgment of David (2 Sam. 12:13-18) and God&rsquo;s promise to David and his descendants (7:14-15).</p>
<p>The judgment of the church and God&rsquo;s disciplinary judgment both deal with the believers for their profit in order to separate them from the world. Both are matters of God&rsquo;s governmental administration within His own household.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT BEFORE<br />
THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>God will also exercise judgment upon believers at the judgment seat of Christ where the actions and work of every believer will be judged. The sins of a believer, which occurred before salvation, were judged in the first judgment of God at the cross of Christ; after a believer&rsquo;s salvation, God continues to exercise judgment upon a believer&rsquo;s sins through the church and through His discipline in order to correct the believers. However, after a believer is saved, his actions and work before God must also be judged at the judgment seat of Christ. Our actions and work after salvation must pass through a final pronouncement of judgment. This judgment, which will occur at the judgment seat of Christ, is the fourth judgment in God&rsquo;s administration of His government. Since it is something that will happen to us in the future, we must pay careful attention to it.</p><h2 class="head2">The Time&mdash;at the Lord&rsquo;s Return</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 4:5).</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; actions and work will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ when Christ returns at the end of the church age. The Lord will bring to light the hidden things of darkness in us and make manifest the counsels of our hearts. He will judge us according to our motives and actions so that we will receive praise from God according to our true condition.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord, the righteous Judge, will recompense me in that day&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8; see also 1 Cor. 3:13).</p>
<p>This verse shows that the Lord will judge us in order to reward us in that day, the day of His return. He will judge our actions and work according to His righteousness after we are saved, and He will reward us according to what we have done.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:19).</p>
<p>In this parable the Lord indicated that His judgment of our actions and work will be a settling of accounts. When we were saved, we received the Lord&rsquo;s grace; His gift is likened to a sum of money that has been given to us for doing business. The Lord will settle accounts with us according to how much we have earned for Him, that is, how we have lived and served Him since our salvation. He will settle accounts with us when He returns. He will require us to give an account of all that we have done since our salvation in order for there to be a full settlement.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;It will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 14:14).</p>
<p>The Lord will judge us in order to determine if we will be repaid with a reward at the resurrection of the righteous. The resurrection of the righteous will take place at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s return. Luke 14:14 proves that the Lord will judge us at the time of His return. Whatever we do for the Lord today will be repaid by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Place&mdash;in the Air</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Lord Himself...will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:16-17).</p>
<p>When the Lord returns, He will descend from heaven to the air. At that time the believers who are dead will rise first, and then the living believers will be changed (1 Cor. 15:51-52). All believers will be caught up together in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then the Lord will judge our actions and work that occur after our salvation. The judgment at the judgment seat of Christ will occur at the Lord&rsquo;s return, and it will take place in the air to which the Lord will descend and the believers will ascend.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Judge&mdash;the Lord</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who examines me is the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>The Judge at the judgment seat of Christ is the Lord. He will examine us. He will be the Judge who examines and judges our actions and work after we were saved.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord, the righteous Judge&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p>The Lord will be a righteous judge at His judgment seat. He will righteously judge our actions and work after we were saved.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The judgment seat of Christ&rdquo;; &ldquo;The judgment seat of God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom. 14:10).</p>
<p>These two verses show that the judgment seat of Christ is also called the judgment seat of God. When Christ judges us in the future, God&rsquo;s judgment will be carried out by Christ. All matters of judgment have been given over to Christ (John 5:22, 27). At the judgment seat Christ will judge from His position of God, as God who is our Judge, just as He will later be the Judge at the throne of His glory and at the great white throne.</p>
<p>Roman emperors often sent high-ranking officials throughout the empire to judge important cases. Whenever these officials came to a city, they established a judgment seat and began to judge. When the apostle Paul spoke of Christ judging the believer&rsquo;s conduct and work, he used this practice as an analogy. Christ will be the &ldquo;highest ranking official&rdquo; sent to carry out God&rsquo;s judgment upon His children and to clear up any problems with their actions and work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ones Being Judged&mdash;the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:10).</p>
<p>It is the believers who will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ. <em>We</em> and <em>all</em> refer to all the believers. All believers will be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ to be judged. The judgment seat of Christ will be established in the air, so the ones who are manifested are those who have been raptured into the air. Since only believers are raptured to the air, only believers are judged before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God...So then each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 14:10-12).</p>
<p>These verses refer to the ones who are judged before the judgment seat of God, which is the judgment seat of Christ, as brothers. Therefore, it is believers who will give an account to the Lord. We will have to explain our treatment of our brothers. Therefore, we should not judge the brothers or speak against them. When we speak against our brothers, we should remember that one day we will stand before the Lord to give an account concerning ourselves. This will not be easy&mdash;it will be very difficult! When we criticize our brothers today, we should remember that we will stand before the Lord one day to give an account concerning ourselves. If we truly saw this matter, we would stop judging the brothers and deal severely with ourselves, correcting ourselves and behaving carefully lest we receive judgment from the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">The Basis&mdash;the Believers&rsquo; Actions and Work</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:10; see also Rev. 22:12; Matt. 16:27).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s judgment of us before His judgment seat will be based on our actions after we were saved. There the Lord will judge us according to what we have practiced, whether good or bad, and He will repay us according to His judgment.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one&rsquo;s work&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 3:13).</p>
<p>The Lord will judge us at His judgment seat not only for our actions but also for our work after being saved. The work that we have done for the Lord after our salvation will be manifested at the judgment seat of Christ to be proved and judged by His fire.</p>
<p>Thus, after we are saved, we cannot be loose in the way that we behave and work for the Lord. These matters will both be judged by the Lord before His judgment seat. The Lord does not save us and then forget us, allowing us to act and work as we please. All that we have done since our salvation will be judged by Him. He will judge us according to these things and give us a recompense. Therefore, it is very important how we live and act after we are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Result&mdash;Some Receiving a Reward and<br />
Some Suffering Loss, but Themselves Being Saved</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&rdquo;; &ldquo;My reward...to render&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 22:12).</p>
<p>At the judgment seat of Christ every believer will receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad. If we have practiced good things, we will receive a good recompense, a reward. If we have practiced evil, we will receive an evil recompense, a punishment. Therefore, the judgment that we receive before the judgment seat of Christ depends upon our actions after we were saved. The judgment seat of Christ will manifest the nature of our actions after we were saved.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If anyone&rsquo;s work...remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone&rsquo;s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 3:14-15).</p>
<p>These verses are clearly worded. At the judgment seat of Christ some will receive a reward, and others will suffer loss. Some will be rewarded because their work will remain after passing through the Lord&rsquo;s testing fire of judgment. Others will suffer loss because their work will be consumed by the Lord&rsquo;s testing fire of judgment. Although they will suffer loss, they themselves will be saved. They will be saved, but it will be as if passing through fire. According to God&rsquo;s salvation, believers are saved eternally. The quality of our work cannot affect or change this matter. Although we may suffer loss, we will not lose our salvation. Although we may suffer loss, we will still be saved. Salvation alone, however, does not mean that we will be without problems. We can still suffer loss as if passing through fire.</p>
<p>The judgment we will face at the judgment seat of Christ is not related to eternal salvation or perdition. It is related to whether or not we will receive a reward or punishment. The matter of our eternal salvation was resolved through God&rsquo;s judgment of Christ at the cross. However, there is still the matter of reward and punishment, which can be decided only at the judgment seat of Christ. Salvation or perdition is related to our sins before salvation; reward or punishment is related to our actions and work after salvation. Our sins were dealt with at the cross of Christ, but our actions and work will be dealt with at the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p>Unbelievers will not be judged at the judgment seat of Christ; only believers will appear before the judgment seat of Christ. Since the matter of our salvation has been resolved, we will never perish. Only believers need to be judged at the judgment seat of Christ in order to manifest of what sort our actions and work are after our salvation. To the extent that we please the Lord, we will be rewarded. To the extent that we displease the Lord, we will suffer loss. This determination will be made at the judgment seat of Christ. In addition to the verses above, Matthew 25:19-30; Luke 19:15-26; and James 5:9 also refer to this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT BEFORE CHRIST&rsquo;S THRONE OF GLORY</h2>
<p>God will also judge man before Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory. The first four judgments of God are related to the believers. The fifth and sixth kind of judgments are related to the nations, the Gentiles, who will be divided into two groups&mdash;the living and the dead. God&rsquo;s judgment of the Gentiles will occur at two different times. He will first judge the living nations, the Gentiles, and later judge the dead unbelievers. In the fifth judgment the living Gentiles will be judged, and in the sixth judgment the dead unbelievers will be judged.</p><h2 class="head2">The Time&mdash;When the Lord Comes</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes...He will sit on the throne of His glory&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:31).</p>
<p>The fifth judgment will occur when the Lord returns. At this time the church age will be over, and the believers will have been raptured to the air to be judged before the judgment seat of Christ. Following Christ&rsquo;s return, He will come to the earth and sit on His throne of glory to judge all the people from the nations living on the earth at that time.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Place&mdash;the Earthly Jerusalem</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;At that time they will call Jerusalem the throne of Jehovah, and all the nations will be gathered to it&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 3:17).</p>
<p>When the Lord returns, Jerusalem will become the throne of Jehovah, the throne of Christ, and all the nations will be gathered to it. When the Lord comes to earth and sits on His throne of glory to judge the nations who are living, He will be in the earthly Jerusalem. The earthly Jerusalem will be the center of God&rsquo;s government and rule on the earth. Therefore, it is reasonable that the Lord would establish His throne of glory there to judge the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Judge&mdash;the Christ Who Comes in Glory</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in His glory...All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:31-32).</p>
<p>In chapter 48 we saw that these verses refer to the nations who are living on earth, the Gentiles. They will be gathered before Christ to be judged by Him. The Judge of the nations who are living on earth will be the Christ who comes in His glory. He will gather all the nations living on earth and separate them, just as a shepherd separates sheep from goats. Even the Gentiles are His flock (Psa. 100:1-3); therefore, as their Shepherd, He is the only One with the authority to judge them.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He has set a day in which He is to judge the world in righteousness by the man whom He has designated&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 17:31; see also John 5:22, 27).</p>
<p>Christ is the man whom God has designated to judge the people in the world. God has given all judgment to Christ. He has given Christ the authority to judge. On the day that God has set, Christ will judge the people in the world in righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:1; see also Acts 10:42).</p>
<p>Christ will judge the people living on earth. God has designated Him as the Judge of the living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ones Being Judged&mdash;the Nations<br />
Living on Earth at the Time of the Lord&rsquo;s Coming</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:32).</p>
<p>Christ will judge the nations living on earth at His throne of glory when He returns. The nations are the Gentiles who are living on earth at that time. The nations do not include believers or Jews. When the Lord returns to the earth, the nations will be gathered before His throne of glory to be judged by Him, just like a shepherd separates his flock.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Judge the world in righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 17:31).</p>
<p>The Lord will judge the world in righteousness. <em>The world</em> means the people in the world. Those who come before the Lord&rsquo;s throne of glory to be judged by Him will be all the people living on the earth.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Who is to judge the living&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:1; see also Acts 10:42).</p>
<p>The Lord will judge the living people on the earth before His throne of glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Basis&mdash;Treating the Lord&rsquo;s Brothers,<br />
the Believers, Well or Evilly</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Inasmuch as you have done it to one of these, the least of My brothers, you have done it to Me...Inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither have you done it to Me&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:40, 45).</p>
<p>Christ will judge the living nations before His throne of glory based upon how they treated the least of His brothers. If they treated the least of the Lord&rsquo;s brothers well, the Lord will call them righteous and consider them sheep. If they treated the Lord&rsquo;s little brothers evilly, the Lord will condemn them as evil and consider them goats. In chapter 48 we saw that these brothers of the Lord are the believers who are left in the tribulation. They are not yet mature, so they are the least of the Lord&rsquo;s brothers. How the people of the earth treat these brothers of the Lord is the basis for the Lord&rsquo;s judgment upon them when He comes to the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">The Result&mdash;Some Entering Eternal Life and<br />
Some Entering Eternal Punishment</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Then the King will say to those on His right hand...inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world...He will say also to those on the left, Go away from Me...into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels...And these shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:34, 41, 46).</p>
<p>When the living nations are judged before Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory, some will enter into eternal life, and others will go away into eternal punishment. Those who enter into eternal life are those who treated the least of the Lord&rsquo;s brothers well. They will be the righteous sheep. Those who go away into eternal punishment are those who treated the least of the Lord&rsquo;s brothers evilly. They will be the evil goats. The righteous will enter eternal life, that is, the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world. Eternal life will be a realm to them. Entering eternal life is different from the believers obtaining eternal life. Eternal life is not simply a realm to the believers; it is also a life. But to the righteous eternal life is only a realm. Obtaining eternal life means that, on the one hand, God&rsquo;s life enters into us when we believe in Christ, and on the other hand, we enter into eternal life when the Lord returns; that is, we will inherit eternal life in eternity (Mark 10:30; Matt. 19:29). However, for the righteous to enter into eternal life is merely an entrance into a realm of eternal life to inherit the kingdom that God has prepared for them. This kingdom is earthly, and its blessings are earthly. God prepared this for them <em>from</em> the foundation of the world. It is different from the kingdom we obtain. The kingdom we obtain is heavenly, and its blessings are heavenly. Our kingdom was planned by God <em>before</em> the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3-4). The righteous will enter into a realm of eternal life to inherit the earthly blessings of the kingdom that God prepared for them from the foundation of the world. These are the blessings that God prepared for man to enjoy on the earth when He created him. These blessings were lost when created man sinned and fell. In the millennial kingdom, however, all things will be restored (Acts 3:21), including these blessings. Thus, God will enable the righteous, earthly people to enjoy these earthly blessings. The kingdom that God prepared for them is the earthly part of the millennial kingdom. These righteous ones will be its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The evil ones will enter into eternal punishment, that is, the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15). The lake of fire is clearly a realm of eternal punishment. This matches the fact that eternal life for the righteous is also a realm. Both eternal life and eternal punishment are realms for these people. One will be a realm of eternal enjoyment, and the other will be a realm of eternal punishment. Both are realms that can be entered. The righteous people, the sheep, who enter into eternal life, will be God&rsquo;s blessed subjects in His kingdom; the evil people, the goats, who enter into eternal punishment, will be the suffering companions of the devil in the lake of fire. These are the result of the judgment before Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory. The parable of the net in Matthew 13:47-50 that we studied in chapter 48 also speaks of this judgment. The good sea life, spoken of in that parable, equals the sheep, and the foul sea life equals the goats.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT<br />
BEFORE THE GREAT WHITE THRONE</h2>
<p>The sixth judgment of God upon man is His judgment at the great white throne. This is God&rsquo;s last judgment upon man; therefore, it is a great matter in God&rsquo;s administrative government over man. Although the fifth judgment deals with the living nations, the dead from all the ages still need to be judged. Thus, there is the need for a final judgment. This is the judgment before the great white throne. All the dead unbelievers from every age will come before the great white throne to be judged to determine their eternal destiny.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Time&mdash;after the Millennial Kingdom,<br />
before the New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were completed...And when the thousand years are completed&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:5, 7).</p>
<p>The judgment at the great white throne will take place after the millennial kingdom and before the new heaven and new earth. Therefore, there will be one thousand years between this judgment and the judgment that occurs at Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory. After the millennial kingdom all the dead, that is, all the unrisen dead, will rise and be judged.</p><h2 class="head2">The Place&mdash;Perhaps in the Air</h2>
<p>The judgment before the great white throne perhaps will take place in the air because by then the heaven and earth will have fled away, and no place will be found for them (Rev. 20:11).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Judge&mdash;the Lord</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A great white throne and Him who sat upon it&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:11; see also John 5:22, 27).</p>
<p>The One who will judge the dead at the great white throne will be the One who is spoken of here as &ldquo;Him who sat upon it.&rdquo; This One must be the Lord Christ. God has given all judgment to Him and designated Him as the Judge of both the living and the dead.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Christ Jesus, who is to judge...the dead&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:1; see also Acts 10:42).</p>
<p>This verse says that Christ will judge the dead. God has established Christ as the Lord who will judge the dead. He will judge the living at His throne of glory, and He will judge the dead at His great white throne.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Ones Being Judged&mdash;All the Dead Unbelievers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne...And the dead were judged&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:12).</p>
<p>Those who are judged before the great white throne are the dead unbelievers. All the dead from every age will stand (<em>standing</em> implies that they had been resurrected) before the great white throne to be judged by the Lord. Those who stand in this judgment will not be saved believers. Since the believers were judged by God at the cross, they will not be judged again at this time related to eternal condemnation. However, those who have no part in the judgment of Christ at the cross must be judged at this time related to eternal condemnation and perdition.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Judge...the dead&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:1; see also Acts 10:42).</p>
<p>Those who are judged at Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory will be the living, that is, the living nations; those who are judged at the great white throne will be the dead, that is, the dead unbelievers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Basis&mdash;Their Works<br />
Which Are Written in the Scrolls</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The dead were judged by the things which were written in the scrolls, according to their works&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:12).</p>
<p>The judgment of the dead unbelievers at the great white throne will be based on their actions which God recorded. God records in scrolls every single thing that one does while he is living. The Lord will judge according to this record, that is, according to everyone&rsquo;s actions while they were alive.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Result&mdash;Being Cast into the Lake of Fire</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:15).</p>
<p>The dead unbelievers who are judged at the great white throne, who were not found written in the book of life, will be cast into hell in the lake of fire to perish and suffer eternally. Since they sinned with the devil when they were alive, they will suffer the punishment of eternal flames with him for eternity.</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth judgments determine whether or not a person perishes. Both of these judgments are before thrones. One is before the throne of glory, and the other is before the great white throne. They are different from the judgment before the judgment seat of Christ. The judgment before the judgment seat determines whether a believer receives a reward or a punishment; the judgments before Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory and the great white throne determine whether or not a person perishes.</p>

<p>The first four judgments of God are related to believers, whereas the last two are related to the nations and unbelievers. The believers have passed through the judgment at the cross, resolving the matter of eternal salvation and becoming the church, the children in the house of God. In the church, the house of God, believers can receive the judgment of the church related to blatant and unrepentant sins and can also receive God&rsquo;s judgment of discipline in order to partake of and manifest His holiness. Prior to the Lord&rsquo;s return, the believers will be raptured to the air to be judged before the judgment seat of Christ to determine either their reward or punishment. When the Lord returns, the living nations will be judged before Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory to determine whether they will enter into eternal life or into eternal punishment. Then the dead unbelievers will face the final judgment at the great white throne at the end of the millennial kingdom to determine their eternal punishment. Through these six judgments every problem related to the satisfaction of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory will be fully cleared up among both believers and unbelievers.</p>
<p>In addition to these six judgments, the Bible also speaks of angels being judged (2 Pet. 2:4; Jude 6). The judges in this judgment are the saved children of God (1 Cor. 6:3).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-EIGHT</h1>

<h2 class="head1">PARADISE</h2>
<p>In addition to the garden of Eden (Gen. 2:8-15), which is commonly considered as a depiction of paradise, the Bible also associates the pleasant section in Hades and the New Jerusalem with the term <em>paradise.</em></p>
<h2 class="head2">The Pleasant Section in Hades<br />
Being Paradise</h2>
<p>The Greek word <em>Hades</em> denotes the same thing as the Hebrew word <em>Sheol.</em> Although it is the place where the spirits and souls of all dead people go (37:35; Job 7:9; Eccl. 9:10; Rev. 20:13), it has two sections, one of which is a pleasant place, and the other of which is a place of torment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Spirits and Souls<br />
of the Righteous<br />
Being in the Pleasant Section</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The beggar died, and he was carried away by the angels into Abraham&rsquo;s bosom...Now he is comforted here&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:22, 25).</p>
<p>Paradise, the pleasant section in Hades, is where the spirits and souls of the righteous go after they die. Luke 16 shows that both Abraham and the beggar Lazarus are in this pleasant section. Although it is a section in Hades, it is a place where the spirits and souls of people are comforted. The spirit and soul of the beggar Lazarus were comforted there after his death. The angels took his spirit and soul to the bosom of Abraham. <em>Bosom</em> signifies a place of comfort, so the bosom of Abraham in Hades represents the section in Hades where people find comfort.</p>
<p>When a person dies, his spirit and soul leave his body, and he becomes a disembodied soul; that is, he becomes naked (2 Cor. 5:3). This is an incomplete, abnormal, and shameful condition, just as being physically naked is shameful. Such a disembodied soul cannot enter into God&rsquo;s presence to see God&rsquo;s face. This situation applies even to the spirits and souls of those who are righteous. Since they are disembodied spirits and souls, they cannot stand before God&rsquo;s face, but being righteous, neither should they go to the place of torment in Hades. Although we have no answer in ourselves as to where the spirits and souls of the righteous should go, our God is both wise and reasonable. According to reason, the spirits and souls of dead people should go to Hades because Hades was prepared expressly for the spirits and souls of the dead. It is a temporary dwelling place for the spirits and souls of the dead prior to their resurrection. After a person dies, his spirit and soul go to Hades to wait for resurrection. This is a reason that the Bible often speaks of death and Hades together. When God&rsquo;s righteous ones die, it is logical that they also would go to Hades, but since they have been justified by God as being righteous, they do not deserve torment in Hades. Therefore, according to His wisdom God opened Paradise, a pleasant section in Hades, so that they might find rest there while waiting for resurrection. When the Lord returns, they will come out of Hades in the resurrection before the millennial kingdom, put on a resurrected body, be raptured to the air, and be with the Lord for eternity. Although they do not suffer torment in death prior to their resurrection, they still must go to Hades to await resurrection because they are disembodied spirits and souls, who are incomplete and abnormal with the condition and shame of death upon them. In resurrection they will put on a body (1 Cor. 15:44) and be complete, normal, and free from the condition and shame of death. They will rise to be with the Lord, leaving Hades behind. When the righteous die, they go to the pleasant section of Hades, leaving the sufferings of earth behind and obtaining the comfort and happiness of Paradise. However, they do not enjoy the Paradise of the New Jerusalem until after they are resurrected. When the righteous resurrect, the overcomers will enjoy the blessing of the Paradise of the New Jerusalem during the millennial kingdom as a reward (Rev. 2:7), and every believer will enjoy the blessing of the Paradise of the New Jerusalem for eternity after the completion of the millennial kingdom. It is possible to enter into the presence of the Lord to enjoy the blessings of Paradise only after one has been resurrected and has put on a resurrected body to become a complete person.</p><h2 class="head3">The Lord Jesus Being in the Pleasant Section<br />
for Three Days and Three Nights after His Death</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 23:43).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;So will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 12:40).</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Neither was He abandoned to Hades&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:31).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was in the Paradise in Hades for three days and three nights after His death. When the Lord was dying on the cross, He promised the thief that he would be with Him in Paradise that day. Acts 2:31 also indicates that Paradise is in Hades because it speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection as the proof that He was not abandoned to Hades following His death. Luke 23:43 and Acts 2:31 show that the Lord entered the Paradise in Hades on the day that He died. According to Matthew 12:40, He was there for three days and three nights until the time of His resurrection from the dead.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Paul Going to the Pleasant Section in a Vision</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I know such a man (whether in the body or outside the body, I do not know; God knows), that he was caught away into Paradise&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 12:3-4).</p>
<p>In these verses Paul speaks of being caught away into Paradise in a vision. Many think that this reference to Paradise is the same as Paul&rsquo;s reference to the third heaven in verse 2. But according to the original Greek and to the facts, being caught away into Paradise and being caught away to the third heaven are two different matters. This portion of Scripture speaks of the revelations received by the apostle (v. 1). In order to give him a full revelation, God caught him away to the third heaven to show him the heavenly things and also into Paradise to show him the things under the earth in Hades. The Bible divides the space in the universe into three parts: the heavens, the earth, and under the earth (Phil. 2:10). In order for a person to have a full revelation, he must know these three parts. Paul was a man living on earth, so he certainly knew the things on the earth, but he did not know the things in heaven or the things under the earth, that is, in Hades. Therefore, God caught him away to the third heaven to show him the things in the heavens as well as to Paradise in Hades to show him the things under the earth. He received the transcendence of the revelations (2 Cor. 12:7), including being caught away into Paradise in Hades.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Location of Paradise</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In the heart of the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 12:40).</p>
<p>Paradise is in the heart of the earth. This is confirmed by the fact that Paradise in Luke 23:43 refers to a place in the heart of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Hades&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:27, 31).</p>
<p>Paradise is in Hades. This is confirmed by the fact that Paradise in Luke 23:43 is also associated with Hades.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Did not ascend into the heavens&rdquo;; &ldquo;In the name of Jesus every knee should bow...under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:34; Phil. 2:10-11).</p>
<p>Many think that when Jesus resurrected and ascended, He brought the righteous ones in Paradise up to heaven. Both Acts 2:34 and Philippians 2:10-11 show that the righteous ones in Paradise did not go to heaven following the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection. Instead, in the name of Jesus they are still under the earth in the Paradise in Hades, bowing their knees and confessing that Jesus is Lord. After the Lord&rsquo;s ascension on the day of Pentecost, Peter specifically said that David did not ascend into the heavens. This proves that the righteous ones in Hades did not go to heaven at that time. If the righteous ones went to heaven when the Lord resurrected and ascended, how could there still be people in the name of Jesus who are bowing their knees and confessing His name with their tongues under the earth? Revelation 6:9 shows that at the time of the fifth seal (near the end of this age), there are still souls underneath the altar. The altar is on the earth, so <em>underneath the altar</em> means under the earth. Until the end of this age, the righteous dead in Paradise will be under the earth in Hades. They will be in Paradise, which is under the earth; it is in the heart of the earth. Even though Paradise is in the heart of the earth, it is still Paradise because the spirits and souls of the righteous enjoy rest there.</p>
<p>Some in Christianity today believe that Paradise in Hades was moved to another place when the Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended from Hades to the heavens. Bible expositors who believe this, such as Scofield and his followers, base this teaching on Ephesians 4:8. They say that the phrase <em>those taken captive</em> in this verse refers to the righteous ones in the Paradise in Hades. According to their view, the spirits and souls of the righteous ones in Hades have been taken captive by the devil and are being held there. They say that since the Lord defeated the devil, who has the might of death, on the cross and defeated death by His resurrection, He led the spirits and souls of those righteous ones who were taken captive by the enemy and held in Hades and brought them to heaven when He ascended. They then use this explanation as a basis for saying that when the Lord ascended to the heavens, He brought both Paradise, where the spirits and souls of the righteous are, and the spirits and souls of the righteous themselves out of Hades into heaven. If we examine this explanation carefully, it is not difficult to see that it is quite strained. Without touching the problems in their translation of Ephesians 4:8, they cannot make a case for saying that the Lord brought Paradise itself, which was in Hades, out of Hades and into heaven when He ascended.</p>
<p><em>Those taken captive</em> refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself. This indicates that He conquered and overcame Satan, who had captured them by sin and death.</p>
<p>The Amplified New Testament renders <em>He led captive those taken captive</em> as &ldquo;He led a train of vanquished foes.&rdquo; <em>Vanquished foes</em> may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, again indicating Christ&rsquo;s victory over Satan, sin, and death. In Christ&rsquo;s ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes, led as captives from a war, for a celebration of Christ&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>Those who say that the Paradise in Hades was moved to the heavens also regard 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 as a strong basis for their teaching. According to their view, the apostle Paul&rsquo;s experiences of being caught away into Paradise and being caught away to the third heaven refer to the same thing because Paradise was no longer in Hades when Paul was caught away, having been moved to the third heaven, which they call heaven. But we have previously seen that being caught away into Paradise and being caught away to the third heaven refer to two different places. Thus, 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 does not prove that Paradise is in the heavens. Rather, it proves that Paradise is still in Hades, which is a different place from heaven.</p>
<p>There are two other portions that are used to try to prove that Paradise in Hades was moved to the heavens: 2 Corinthians 5:8 and Philippians 1:23. These portions speak of being abroad from the body and at home with the Lord and of departing and being with Christ. Based on these two portions, some say that when the believers leave their bodies to be with the Lord, they must go to the Lord, who is now in the heavens. They then say that since the dead believers leave the earth to go to Paradise to be with the Lord, Paradise must be in the heavens. However, from experience we know that being at home with the Lord and being with the Lord are relative matters before the rapture and transfiguration of the believers (1 Thes. 4:17). Before the rapture and transfiguration of the believers, these matters are not absolute. For example, Genesis 5&mdash;6 tells us that Enoch and Noah both walked with God while they were living on the earth. Second Corinthians 5 and Philippians 1 also speak of these matters in a relative sense. When we believers are in our physical bodies, we live in the physical realm. Although we can live and be with the Lord in our spirit and heart, we are separated from Him at a physical level. When we leave our bodies, we leave the physical realm and enter into a spiritual realm in which we can live and be with the Lord in a deeper, closer way. But even then, we are not fully living with the Lord and are not absolutely with the Lord. These portions do not say that we are absolutely with the Lord after leaving the earth, so they cannot be used to prove that Paradise in Hades is in the heavens where the Lord is now.</p>
<p>Others say that Paradise must be in the heavens because 1 Thessalonians 4:14 says that God will bring those who have fallen asleep through Jesus with Him. This verse, however, is spoken in the context of the Lord&rsquo;s return, and verse 16 specifically says that the dead in Christ will rise when the Lord returns. Verse 14 cannot be used to prove that the dead in Christ are with the Lord Jesus in the heavens simply because God will bring them back with Christ. For example, a father may be doing business in America while his son is studying in Japan. One day the father may write to the mother and tell her that he is bringing their son with him when he returns, but this does not prove that the son is with the father in America. Similarly, 1 Thessalonians 4:14 cannot be used to prove that the believers are in the heavens with the Lord before their resurrection or that prior to their resurrection the believers are in a Paradise that is in the heavens.</p>
<p>The teaching that Paradise in Hades was moved to the heavens is incorrect. According to the Bible, Paradise is in Hades, and it has not moved. Because Paradise is in Hades, the righteous ones will rise from under the earth when they are resurrected. This is the only explanation that is consistent with the meaning of resurrection since <em>resurrection</em> means &ldquo;rising up&rdquo; in the original Greek. If Paradise has been moved to the heavens, the righteous could only descend from the heavens at the time of the resurrection. This, however, would not be a rising up. The righteous in this Paradise will resurrect; they will rise up. This further proves that Paradise is under the earth in Hades, not in the heavens.</p><h2 class="head2">The Future New Jerusalem Being<br />
the Paradise of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God&rdquo;; &ldquo;A better country, that is, a heavenly one&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 11:10, 16).</p>
<p>The first verse speaks of a city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God. According to the Bible, this city is the future New Jerusalem. This is the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem (12:22), the Jerusalem above (Gal. 4:26), the holy city, New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2; 3:12), which God has prepared for His people (Heb. 11:16), and the tabernacle of God, in which God will dwell with men for eternity (Rev. 21:3). The city that God is building will come out of His house; therefore, just as the church, God&rsquo;s house (1 Tim. 3:15), is being built today, this city also is being built.</p>
<p>In the Bible God reveals that He wants His house to become a city. He is building His house today so that it will become a city in the future. At the beginning of the Bible there is a garden, and at the end of the Bible there is a city. Both this garden and this city have many similar features, and those who carefully read the Bible agree that the New Jerusalem in Revelation signifies the culmination of God&rsquo;s work that began in the garden of Eden in Genesis. A garden is a place for a house. God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages is to build His garden and His house into a city. He wants to enlarge His house into a city, and this city, the New Jerusalem, will be the Paradise of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:22; see also Gal. 4:26).</p>
<p>The coming New Jerusalem, which God&rsquo;s dwelling place today will become, is a heavenly city, a city that God has designed and built. As such, it is God&rsquo;s dwelling; it is the city of the living God. Thus, the coming New Jerusalem is called the city of the living God and the heavenly Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The New Jerusalem in the Millennial Kingdom</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:7).</p>
<p>This verse says that the tree of life is an outstanding feature of the Paradise of God. Since the tree of life is in the New Jerusalem (Rev. 22:1-2), the New Jerusalem must be this Paradise. According to Revelation 2:7, eating of the tree of life in the Paradise of God will be a reward in the millennial kingdom. Only overcoming believers will enjoy the blessings in Paradise during the millennium. Later, at the time of the new heaven and new earth, all believers will enjoy these blessings. The Paradise of God, the New Jerusalem, is clearly different from the Paradise in Hades. The Paradise in Hades has existed since Old Testament times, but the Paradise of God is related to the coming millennial kingdom and will not be completely manifested until the time of the new heaven and the new earth. The first Paradise is under the earth in Hades; the latter Paradise is the heavenly Jerusalem. The first Paradise is for the spirits and souls of the righteous throughout all time until the Lord returns. The latter Paradise is for the resurrected, raptured, transformed, and overcoming believers during the millennial kingdom and for all the resurrected, raptured, and transformed believers in the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The New Jerusalem<br />
in the New Heavens and New Earth</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A new heaven and a new earth...The holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:1-2).</p>
<p>The last book in the Bible, Revelation, shows that when God&rsquo;s work in the universe is finished, the old heaven and old earth will pass away, and the new heaven and new earth will come. The New Jerusalem will be in the new heaven and new earth as the eternal dwelling place of God and all His redeemed in the Old and New Testament times. This New Jerusalem is the Paradise of God and the holy city of God. This holy city is very mysterious, and every point concerning it manifests deep spiritual meaning.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The city lies square...twelve thousand stadia; the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:16).</p>
<p>The length and the breadth and the height of the holy city are equal. In principle, these equal dimensions reflect the equal dimensions of the Holy of Holies in the Old Testament (1 Kings 6:20). This signifies that the entire holy city is God&rsquo;s Holy of Holies in eternity.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:14).</p>
<p>Since the twelve apostles represent the redeemed New Testament believers, the twelve foundations bearing the names of the twelve apostles signify that the New Testament believers are the constituents of the holy city.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;It had...twelve gates, and at the gates...names inscribed, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:12).</p>
<p>Since the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel represent all the redeemed Old Testament saints, the twelve gates bearing the names of the twelve tribes signify that the Old Testament saints are also the constituents of the holy city. The holy city, New Jerusalem, is composed of all of God&rsquo;s redeemed people from the Old Testament and the New Testament times to be God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The city was pure gold, like clear glass...And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:18, 21).</p>
<p>Pure gold like clear glass signifies God&rsquo;s pure nature, which is the city&rsquo;s element.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The twelve gates were twelve pearls&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:21).</p>
<p>Pearls signify the Son&rsquo;s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, through which entrance to the city is gained. This means that only those in Christ&rsquo;s new creation can participate in (enter into) the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Her light was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal&rdquo;; &ldquo;Its wall was jasper&rdquo;; &ldquo;The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:11, 18-19).</p>
<p>Precious stones signify that the saints have been transformed through the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit to be the material for God&rsquo;s building (Rom. 15:16; 2 Cor. 3:18; 1 Pet. 2:4-5). Gold, pearls, and precious stones signify that the New Jerusalem is constituted with the element of the Triune God and accomplished by His threefold work.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:22).</p>
<p>The absence of a temple in the holy city signifies that the entire holy city is the temple of God. The city is the temple, the mutual dwelling place of God and His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. God dwells within His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people, and they dwell in God. This is a mysterious union.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;The throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:3).</p>
<p>The throne of God and of the Lamb at the center of the holy city signifies that God&rsquo;s authority, the governance of His eternal kingdom, is the central feature of the holy city.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life,...yielding its fruit each month&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:1-2).</p>
<p>The holy city is like a mountain with the throne of God at the top. There is only one street in the city that spirals downward, reaching the twelve gates of the city on the north, south, east, and west. In the middle of this street the river of water of life flows, and in the river the tree of life grows like a vine along the two banks of the river, yielding its fruit each month. This signifies that the life of the Triune God will eternally flow out as living water and produce fruit as food to supply the entire city, which is the redeemed people of God. God&rsquo;s life is the &ldquo;street&rdquo; for communication within the city, going from the throne of God to the gates of the city and from the gates of the city to the throne of God.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;The city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb&rdquo;; &ldquo;And night will be no more; and they have no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:23; 22:5).</p>
<p>The Triune God is not only the life of the holy city but also the light and the glory of the holy city as her expression.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Enter into it...only those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:27).</p>
<p>Only those who believe in Christ will be part of the holy city (enter into it). The New Jerusalem will be an eternal, divine blessing for those joined to the Triune God by believing in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THIRD HEAVEN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A man in Christ...was caught away to the third heaven&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 12:2).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The heaven of heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Deut. 10:14; 1 Kings 8:27; 2 Chron. 2:6).</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 12:2 Paul speaks of a man in Christ being caught away to the third heaven. This man was Paul. God wanted to show him the things in the heavens, so He caught him away to the third heaven. The Bible divides the heavens into several levels, the heaven of heavens and the heavens (Eph. 4:10; Heb. 7:26). The third heaven is above the stars; it is the highest heaven (Isa. 14:13-14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Dwelling Place of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Your dwelling place in the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (1 Kings 8:30).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Place Where the Lord Jesus Is Today</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Into heaven itself, to appear now before the face of God&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:24; see also 1 Pet. 3:22).</p>
<p>The Chinese Union Version translates <em>heaven</em> in these two portions as &ldquo;heavenly mansion.&rdquo; This is not according to the original Greek. The Greek word in these two verses is the same word that is translated as &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; in Mark 16:19 and Luke 24:51. &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; is the correct translation according to the original language.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Location of the Third Heaven</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The height&rdquo;; &ldquo;On high&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:8; Heb. 1:3).</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:8 and Hebrews 1:3 both speak of the Lord Jesus ascending to the height or on high. The same Greek root word is used in both portions. This shows that the Lord Jesus today is in the height of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Higher than the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 7:26).</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Far above all the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:10).</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;I will ascend to heaven; / Above the stars of God / I will exalt my throne. / And I will sit upon the mount of assembly / In the uttermost parts of the north. / I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; / I will make myself like the Most High&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 14:13-14).</p>
<p>These verses clearly show that God is in the heaven that is above the stars and the clouds. It is in the uttermost parts of the north. This phrase <em>the uttermost parts of the north</em> must refer to the highest place where God sits on His throne. Thus, it is the highest place in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Neither from the east nor from the west, / And neither from the south, does exaltation come; / For God is the Judge&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 75:6-7; see also 48:2; Ezek. 1:4).</p>
<p>Exaltation does not come from the east, the west, or the south, for only God is the Judge. The north is not mentioned in Psalm 75:6 because God is in the north. Since exaltation is by God, it must come from the north, not from the east, the west, or the south. This verse shows that God is in the north. Since God dwells in the north, the vision of God&rsquo;s glory that Ezekiel saw also came from the north (Ezek. 1:4). Furthermore, when God commanded men on earth to build Jerusalem as a type of His heavenly dwelling, it was on the sides of the north (Psa. 48:2). All these verses signify that the third heaven is in the north.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECTION OF TORMENT IN HADES</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The rich man also died and was buried. And in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torment, and saw Abraham from afar and Lazarus in his bosom. And he called out...I am in anguish in this flame&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:22-24; see also Job 24:19).</p>
<p>Hades is divided into two sections. The first section is the pleasant section, the section of comfort. The spirits and souls of the righteous are in this pleasant section, which is Paradise in Hades. The second section is a section of torment. The spirits and souls of the sinners come to this place after their death. According to Luke 16 the rich man who died was suffering in this section of torment, burning in a flame and being in terrible anguish. In his torment, however, he still could see the pleasant section of Paradise. His ability to see Lazarus in Abraham&rsquo;s bosom caused him to suffer even more. Job 24:19 says, &ldquo;Drought and heat snatch the snow water, / As Sheol snatches those who have sinned.&rdquo; There is no rest and enjoyment in the section of torment in Hades.</p>
<p>Hades follows after Death to collect the dead (Rev. 6:8). The spirits and souls of dead unbelievers go to the section of torment in Hades to wait for the resurrection. The section of torment in Hades is more than a temporary dwelling place, it is a temporary jail. Unbelievers are kept in this section of Hades as a temporary jail until after the millennial kingdom, when they will be resurrected to stand before the great white throne of judgment. Then their eternal fate will be determined; that is, they will be thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone to perish for eternity. The righteous in the Paradise in Hades will be resurrected before the millennial kingdom. After the millennial kingdom, the dead in the section of torment in Hades will be resurrected, and Hades will be emptied. At this point, no one will be in Hades.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A great chasm is fixed, so that those wanting to pass from here to you cannot, neither from there to us may any cross over&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 16:26).</p>
<p>Although people in the two sections in Hades can see each other and speak to each other, there is a great chasm fixed between them that cannot be crossed. This proves that the two sections are clearly separated even though they are not far apart.</p><h2 class="head1">GEHENNA</h2>
<p><em>Gehenna</em> is the Hebrew name for a deep valley near Jerusalem called Ge Hinnom, valley of Hinnom. It is also called Topheth (2 Kings 23:10; Isa. 30:33; Jer. 19:13). The worshippers of Molech burned their children there, and later the Jews burned the bodies of criminals there as well as unclean things. The fire there never went out. The Bible uses this picture to describe how sinners will be burned in the lake of fire outside of the New Jerusalem as an eternal punishment.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The judgment of Gehenna&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 23:33).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Into Gehenna, where...the fire is not quenched&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 9:47-48).</p>
<p>The judgment of Gehenna is the judgment of unquenchable fire; therefore, it is an eternal judgment in the lake of fire. The word translated as &ldquo;hell&rdquo; in the King James Version in Mark 9:43 and 47; Matthew 5:22, 29-30; 10:28; 18:9; and 23:15; Luke 12:5; and James 3:6 are all Gehenna in the original text. Thus, they all refer to the judgment of the lake of fire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAKE OF FIRE</h2>
<p>The lake of fire is the final dwelling place for the devil with his angels and for all the sinners and everything that is contrary to God.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The beast was seized, and with him the false prophet...These two were cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 19:20).</p>
<p>Antichrist, the beast, and his false prophet will be thrown alive into the lake of fire. They will be the first to go into the lake of fire since they oppose God most fiercely. They will be cast into the lake of fire when the Lord returns to defeat the nations who oppose Him on the earth. This will occur before the start of the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If anyone worships the beast and his image...he shall be tormented in fire and brimstone&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:9-10).</p>
<p>Those who worship Antichrist, the beast, and his image will suffer in the lake of fire. They will go into the lake of fire before the millennium.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:41).</p>
<p>When the Lord comes to judge the nations living on earth, those who are condemned as evil, that is, the goats, will go into the lake of fire to suffer eternal punishment. This will occur before the millennial kingdom. This eternal fire was prepared by God as a place of eternal punishment for the devil and the angels who followed him in his rebellion against God. Unforgiven sinners will be thrown into the lake of fire because they followed the devil to sin against God. Those who followed the devil in rebellion against God will be punished with the devil. As companions of the devil in sinning, the unbelievers will be companions of the devil in his punishment.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The devil, who deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:10).</p>
<p>The devil will be cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire was originally prepared for him, and it is fitting that he be thrown into the lake of fire after the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:14).</p>
<p>Even death and Hades will be cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. Aside from the lake of fire, all matters pertaining to death are included in the first death. Death and Hades will be thrown into the lake of fire after the millennial kingdom when all the spirits and souls of the dead in Hades are resurrected. At this time Hades will be empty and useless. Therefore, God will throw Hades into the lake of fire to terminate it.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;; &ldquo;The cowardly and unbelieving and abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all the false, their part will be in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:15; 21:8).</p>
<p>All the unsaved people throughout the ages, whose names are not written in the book of life, that is, those who are not in Christ, will be cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire will be the portion that they deserve for their sins. After the millennial kingdom, they will rise from Hades to pass through judgment at the great white throne and then be cast into the lake of fire. They will be the last group cast into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death to them. Prior to being cast into the lake of fire, all the sufferings that they have passed through, whether of spirit, soul, or body, are part of the first death. The first death is merely temporary; the second death is an eternal death and their eternal end. Hades is merely a temporary jail. At the great white throne they will pass through judgment and will be cast into the lake of fire, which will be their permanent prison.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and makes a lie&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:15).</p>
<p>The lake of fire will be outside of the New Jerusalem, just as Gehenna was outside of the earthly Jerusalem. Those who commit sins and are cast into the lake of fire for eternal punishment are like unclean dogs in the eyes of God. They are cast into the lake of fire to be punished for eternity because God considers them unclean.</p>
<p>The lake of fire signifies eternal punishment for all who oppose God, and the New Jerusalem signifies eternal enjoyment for all God&rsquo;s people. They are the exact opposite of each other. The result of God&rsquo;s work in the universe throughout the ages issues in two very different ends. One is a city of water of life and the other is a lake of fire of death. One is God&rsquo;s eternal habitation, and the other is the devil&rsquo;s eternal prison. One is a place of eternal enjoyment for God and all who belong to Him, and the other is a place of eternal punishment for the devil and all who follow him. All who choose God and stand with Him will be part of (enter into) the glorious city as the wife of the Lamb (21:9) for His eternal enjoyment. All who choose the devil and stand with him will descend into the lake of suffering as the devil&rsquo;s companions in his eternal punishment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ABYSS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They entreated Him not to order them to depart into the abyss&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 8:31).</p>
<p>Demons are imprisoned in the abyss. The demons&rsquo; entreaty to the Lord Jesus in Luke 8:31 proves that God has imprisoned the demons in the abyss. Demons are not related to the devil himself, sinning angels, or the spirits and souls of dead men. According to the Bible, demons must be a group of living creatures who were under the devil&rsquo;s control on the earth in the preadamic age. When they followed the devil in his rebellion against God, they became disembodied evil spirits. They are on the earth to harm sinful, worldly people, but God wants to imprison them in the abyss.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil...and cast him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:2-3).</p>
<p>The devil will be laid hold of and cast into the abyss to be shut up there. In addition to these portions, Revelation 9:1-2; 11:7; and 17:8 speak of the abyss. They refer to the devil and demons. In Romans 10:7 the word <em>abyss</em> is also used.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TARTARUS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If God did not spare the angels who sinned but delivered them to gloomy pits, having cast them down to Tartarus, they being kept for judgment&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 2:4, some ancient manuscripts say <em>gloomy chains</em> instead of <em>gloomy pits</em>).</p>
<p><em>Tartarus</em> is a Greek word that refers to a deep and gloomy pit where sinning angels are imprisoned. The angels who sinned were cast into Tartarus. The Chinese Union Version translates <em>Tartarus</em> as &ldquo;hell.&rdquo; Actually, Tartarus is not hell. In the Greek, <em>hell</em> is another word. Tartarus is a very deep pit into which God has cast the angels who sinned, giving them up to the gloom, or to the chains of gloom. He shut them up there to wait for judgment (Jude 6). Tartarus is where sinning angels are imprisoned. This place is the prison spoken of in 1 Peter 3:19.</p>
<p>The section of torment in Hades, the abyss, and Tartarus are like three different jails. The section of torment in Hades is a jail for the spirits and souls of unbelieving sinners, the abyss is a jail for the devil and demons, and Tartarus is a jail for angels who have sinned. Using these jails, God carries out His judgment in His government in the universe. God has prepared a place for each category of rebellious, sinful creature, and He jails them each in their own place.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-NINE</h1>

</ol>
<p>The rapture of the believers is a great matter in the Bible, and it directly relates to the believers&rsquo; future. While worldly people do not know about this matter, many newly saved brothers and sisters also do not know. However, the Bible clearly says that when the Lord Jesus returns, He will rapture those who are saved and belong to Him. This is a promise given to all who belong to the Lord. Therefore, it is a blessed hope to us.</p>
<p>Throughout the centuries Bible readers and expositors have held differing views concerning the rapture of the believers. Consequently, this matter has been a source of unending arguments among believers. Views concerning the rapture can be divided into three schools. One school argues that all the believers will be raptured before the great tribulation. This school has the greatest number of adherents, including J. N. Darby and those with him. C. I. Scofield, D. L. Moody, and R. A. Torrey also share this view, which is the most common among believers today. Another school argues that all believers will be raptured at the end of the tribulation. This school has the fewest adherents, but among them are George M&#252;ller, B. W. Newton, A. J. Gordon, and A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. The view of these brothers is not held by many. A third school argues that overcoming believers will be raptured before the tribulation, but defeated believers will pass through the great tribulation and be raptured at the end of the tribulation. This school includes Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, R. C. Chapman, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton. The co-workers among us also believe this. We need to look at the Bible to see that this is the correct view.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RAPTURE OF THE OVERCOMING BELIEVERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Need</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;At that time there will be great tribulation, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:21).</p>
<p>Matthew 24:21 speaks of a time of great tribulation upon the earth. Based on verse 15 of this chapter, this time of tribulation will occur during the second half of the last seven years before the return of the Lord Jesus. Verse 15 speaks of what is prophesied in Daniel 9:27. At that time Antichrist, who is the prince (of Rome) in verse 26, the man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-4, and the beast in Revelation 13:1-8; 17:11-14; and 19:19-20 will oppose the Lord and stand against God. He will set up an abominable idol in the temple in Jerusalem, an image of himself. He will force people to worship him, and he will do as he pleases on the earth for forty-two months, or three and a half years. This will be a time of great tribulation on the earth, such as has not occurred from the beginning of the world until now, nor shall by any means ever occur again.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;That day come upon you suddenly as a snare. For it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:34-35).</p>
<p>The day of the great tribulation will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of the earth as suddenly as a snare. All those dwelling on the face of the earth will fall into the great tribulation, just as birds fall into a snare. No one will be able to escape. Today man regards the earth as a safe place for dwelling, but he has little realization that a great tribulation will suddenly come upon all those dwelling on the face of the earth. Revelation 8:13 speaks of those dwelling on the earth, saying, &ldquo;Woe, woe, woe, to those who dwell on the earth!&rdquo; However, believers are not dwellers but sojourners. If we are like those who dwell on the earth, it will be as difficult for us to escape the great tribulation as it is for the others who are dwelling on the earth.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:10).</p>
<p>The day of the coming great tribulation will be a trial for all who dwell on the earth. Those who dwell on the earth will be tried by the great tribulation, and none will be able to escape. Those who are in the midst of a war want to find a safe place to dwell, but when the great tribulation comes to the inhabited earth, there will be no place of escape.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child; and they shall by no means escape&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:3).</p>
<p>Today people are seeking peace and security, but when people say, &ldquo;Peace and security,&rdquo; sudden destruction will come upon them, just as birth pangs to a woman with child, and they will by no means escape.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has come down to you and has great rage, knowing that he has only a short time&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:12).</p>
<p>Based on the context of Revelation 12:6 and 14, the devil will come down with great rage at the beginning of the last three and a half years before the Lord&rsquo; s return. At that time the devil will know that he has only a short time, and he will come down in a great rage to harm people, creating all kinds of destruction upon the earth. Therefore, verse 12 says, &ldquo;Woe to the earth and the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:17).</p>
<p>The woman spoken of in verse 17 is composed of all those who belong to God from both the Old Testament and New Testament ages. <em>The rest of her seed</em> refers to the people of God who will be left on the earth during the great tribulation. Some of these keep God&rsquo;s commandments; they are the remnant of the Jews. Others have the testimony of Jesus; they are the believers who are left on earth at the time of the great tribulation. During the coming great tribulation, the devil, the cruel dragon, will fight with these two groups of people on the earth to torment them and to cause them to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Permission was given to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 13:7).</p>
<p>Antichrist will do what he wills during the great tribulation, and God will give him permission to make war with the saints and to overcome them. This is a kind of destruction to the believers left on earth during the great tribulation.</p>
<p>The preceding verses show that a great tribulation will come upon the earth, such as has never been seen before and will never occur again. There will be a pouring out of God&rsquo;s wrath on the earth, the devil&rsquo;s violence and cruelty on the earth, and the killing and persecution of saints by both the devil and Antichrist. These calamities and sufferings speak of the need to be raptured in order to escape the tribulations that will come upon the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">The Promise</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:36).</p>
<p>Luke 21:36 is a promise from the Lord to those who are in need of being raptured to escape the tribulations that will come upon the earth. In verses 25 and 26, the Lord spoke of the terrible tribulations coming upon the earth, and in verses 34 and 35, He spoke of the difficulty in escaping them. Despite these warnings, He promised that it would be possible to escape these tribulations. However, this promise is related to the requirement that the believers would be watchful at every time and would constantly beseech. To be watchful at every time is to be careful and alert so that one&rsquo;s heart is not dragged down by debauchery, drunkenness, and the anxieties of life (v. 34). To beseech constantly is to approach the Lord and ask Him for an escape from the coming tribulations. If we do these things, the Lord will consider us worthy to escape the tribulations that are coming upon the earth, and we will stand before the Son of Man, which means we will be raptured to His presence. Not every believer will obtain this promise of rapture, because not every believer will fulfill the Lord&rsquo;s requirements to be watchful at all times and to beseech constantly.</p>
<p>Although the Lord&rsquo;s promise is available to every believer, the requirement for obtaining this promise is not related to being saved but to being watchful and beseeching constantly. It is not enough to be saved; we must be watchful at all times and beseech constantly in order to obtain the Lord&rsquo;s promise. To be watchful at all times, beseeching constantly, is to live an overcoming life before the Lord. Therefore, overcoming is the requirement related to this promise. Only those who keep themselves from the desire to enjoy worldly riches and entertainment and who are not entangled by the anxieties of this life will stand before the Lord as watchful overcomers. Such ones will be considered worthy to escape the tribulations that are coming upon the earth, and they will be raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s presence before the coming of these tribulations. They will be raptured and will escape the earth that will be struck with tribulations. They will stand before the Lord and enjoy the blessing of His presence. This promise shows that the view that all believers will be raptured before the great tribulation and the view that all believers will be raptured after the great tribulation are both inaccurate for the following three reasons.</p>
<p>First, the Lord does not promise that all believers will be counted worthy to escape the coming tribulation and will be raptured to stand before His face. His promise is to those who are watching constantly and praying always. In other words, the Lord&rsquo;s promise is not related to salvation but to overcoming. Those who are merely saved cannot be counted worthy of this blessing; only those who are saved and who overcome are worthy. This should be a warning to us. This also proves that all the believers will not be raptured at the same time. There must be a difference between the watching and beseeching believers who are raptured to escape these tribulations and those who are raptured later.</p>
<p>Second, not all believers live an overcoming life before the Lord by watching constantly and praying always. Therefore, not all will be counted worthy to escape the coming tribulation to stand before the Lord. Since all are not worthy of being raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s presence before the great tribulation, the view that all believers will be raptured in one group before the great tribulation is inaccurate.</p>
<p>Third, the overcoming believers who are watching constantly and praying always as they live before the Lord will be counted worthy of escaping the coming tribulation and of being raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s presence; that is, they will be raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s presence before the great tribulation. Since only these will be worthy of being raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s presence before the great tribulation, the view that all believers will be raptured in one group before the great tribulation is inaccurate.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:10).</p>
<p>The Lord promises to keep believers who have kept the word of His endurance out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth. To keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance is to keep the Lord&rsquo;s word on the earth that rejects Him; it involves suffering distress and persecution from the world. To escape the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole inhabited earth is to escape the coming great tribulation. The great tribulation will try those who dwell on the earth; they will pass through this time of great tribulation and be tested tremendously. If believers live on the earth in the same way as worldly people, they will pass through this time of great tribulation with them and be tested by it. However, if believers reject this world and keep the Lord&rsquo;s word on the earth, suffering the distress and persecution of the world, they will be kept by the Lord from this hour of trial and escape the tribulation. They will escape not only the trial of the great tribulation but also the hour of this trial. Therefore, they will be raptured from the earth before the great tribulation.</p>
<p>If we keep the Lord&rsquo;s word on the earth that rejects Him and endure sufferings and persecution, the Lord will keep us from the hour of trial that is to come. He will rapture us before the great tribulation to keep us from passing through this hour of trial. This promise shows that the view that all believers will be raptured before the great tribulation and the view that all believers will be raptured after the great tribulation are both inaccurate for the following two reasons.</p>
<p>First, since not every believer will keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance, not every believer will be raptured before the great tribulation to escape its hour of trial. This clearly proves that the view that all believers will be raptured at one time before the great tribulation is inaccurate. Those who hold this inaccurate view, nevertheless, regard the Lord&rsquo;s promise in Revelation 3:10 as a strong proof of their position because they focus only on the words <em>keep you out of the hour of trial,</em> while ignoring the fact that the conditions of the promise do not apply to all believers. The Lord&rsquo;s promise here is not a proof but rather a condemnation of their teaching.</p>
<p>Second, according to the Lord&rsquo;s promise, the overcoming believers who have kept the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance will be raptured before the great tribulation to escape its hour of trial. This clearly proves that the view that all believers will be raptured at one time after the great tribulation is inaccurate. Those who say that all believers will be raptured at one time after the great tribulation say that everyone must pass through the tribulation. Thus, they have difficulty explaining the Lord&rsquo;s promise here. They say that even though all believers must pass through the great tribulation before being raptured, those who keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance will be preserved during the great tribulation and kept from suffering its tribulations, just as the Israelites in Goshen did not suffer from the plagues God sent upon Egypt (Exo. 8:21-24; 9:3-7, 22-26). However, the Lord&rsquo;s promise to the believers who keep the word of His endurance is that they will be kept not only from the trials of the great tribulation but also from the hour of trial. It does not say that they will pass through the hour of trial but be kept from its sufferings; it says that they will be kept completely from the hour of trial. They will not pass through this hour. This proves that some believers will be raptured before the tribulation and will not pass through the tribulation before they are raptured. This truth is contrary to the teaching that all believers will pass through the tribulation and be raptured together at one time after the tribulation.</p>
<p>I once met a preacher who was very strong in teaching that all believers must pass through the great tribulation before being raptured at one time after the tribulation. I asked him about Revelation 3:10, and he confessed that this verse was quite difficult for him to explain because it speaks of escaping the hour of trial. Since some will escape this hour, they surely cannot pass through it. The teaching that all believers will pass through the great tribulation and be raptured together at one time after the tribulation is inaccurate.</p>
<p>In the preceding two portions in Luke 21 and Revelation 3, the Lord clearly promises that if we watch constantly, pray always, and keep the word of His endurance, we will be raptured to His presence before the great tribulation and be kept from the trial that comes upon the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">The Facts</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;So also will the coming of the Son of Man be. At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:39-41).</p>
<p>These verses speak of facts related to the rapture of the believers and prove that some believers will be raptured and others will be left. The two men and two women spoken of here refer to believers. We should not regard the first man and first woman as believers, and the second man and second woman as unbelievers. The Bible does not consider the situation of believers and unbelievers as being the same and, therefore, does not compare them with each other in this portion. Also, according to verse 42, the Son of Man is described as being the Lord of the men in the field and the women at the mill. Therefore, verses 39 through 41 compare the situation of believers who are watching with believers who are not watching. When the Lord returns, the believers who are watching will be raptured, and the believers who are not watching will be left. The believers who are watching will be raptured, and the believers who are not watching will be left behind.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;She brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:5).</p>
<p>The man-child brought forth by the woman will be caught up to God&rsquo;s throne. This is a fact related to the rapture of the overcoming believers. The woman represents all God&rsquo;s people from the Old Testament and New Testament ages. However, in the Bible a man-child refers to a strong one. Thus, the man-child brought forth by the woman will be the strong ones from among God&rsquo;s people throughout all the ages. This man-child will shepherd the nations with an iron rod. This corresponds with what is said concerning the believers who overcome the degradation associated with the church in Thyatira in Revelation 2:26-27. In Revelation 12:5 the man-child is described as shepherding the nations with an iron rod. This indicates that the man-child in chapter 12 bears the characteristics of the overcomers in chapter 2, and it also proves that the rapture in chapter 12 is a rapture of overcomers.</p>
<p>According to verse 6 of chapter 12, the rapture of these overcomers occurs before the last three and one half years, which is a thousand two hundred and sixty days, the time of great tribulation. Furthermore, according to the context of verse 17, after these overcomers are raptured, there will still be believers on earth who &ldquo;have the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo; Therefore, this portion shows that the overcoming believers will be raptured before the great tribulation and other believers will be left behind in the great tribulation.</p>
<p>The verses in Revelation 12 related to the rapture of the man-child present a problem that cannot be resolved by the group that teaches that all believers will be raptured before the tribulation or by the group that teaches that all believers will be raptured after the tribulation. With the exception of a few overcomers, who are raptured before the great tribulation, most believers will be left on the earth during the tribulation. These verses show that not all believers will be raptured before the tribulation. These verses, however, also show that some believers will be raptured before the great tribulation. Since neither of the views related to a rapture before the tribulation or a rapture after the tribulation can be reconciled with these verses, we must reject both views. According to verse 5 and other portions of the Bible, we should acknowledge only that there will be a rapture of overcoming believers before the great tribulation and a rapture of the believers who have passed through the tribulation at the end of the tribulation.</p>
<p>When I spoke to the preacher who strongly taught that all the believers would be raptured at the end of the tribulation, I asked him about the verses in Revelation 2:26-27 and chapter 12. I said, &ldquo;There are many thoughts about the identity of the man-child, but based on these verses, no one would say that the man-child does not refer to overcomers among the believers. Since the man-child displays the characteristic of an overcoming believer and since the man-child is raptured before the three and one half years of the great tribulation, it would be wrong to say that no believer will be raptured before the great tribulation. How can you say that all believers must pass through the great tribulation and be raptured at one time after the tribulation?&rdquo; This preacher had no answer. Then I said that I could only believe that all believers would be raptured after the great tribulation if Revelation 3:10 and Revelation 12:5-6 did not exist. But these two portions tell us clearly and definitely that some believers will be raptured before the tribulation and others will be left on earth to pass through the tribulation before being raptured. When I got to this point, this brother admitted that these portions of the Bible posed a great difficulty for him. These verses are difficult for people like him because they clearly show that a group of believers will be raptured before the tribulation. The teaching that all believers will pass through the tribulation and be raptured together at the end of the tribulation is too strained. According to the Bible, we must believe that a group of overcoming believers will be raptured before the great tribulation and that the rest of the believers will be left on the earth during the tribulation to be raptured at its end. There is no need to strain to believe this.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand...These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. And in their mouth no lie was found; they are without blemish&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:1, 4-5).</p>
<p>According to these verses one hundred and forty-four thousand are on Mount Zion, which is the heavenly Mount Zion (Heb. 12:22), as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. In order to be standing on Mount Zion in the heavens, their entire being must have been raptured to the heavens because the spirits and souls of the dead cannot enter into the presence of God in heaven. This point was clearly seen in chapter 58. Therefore, those who are on the heavenly Mount Zion cannot be unclothed spirits and souls but must be entire persons with bodies who have been raptured to the heavens. Revelation 14:4 says that they were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb. <em>Firstfruits</em> refers to a harvest that starts in a field, and the field is the world (Matt. 13:38). The firstfruits were growing in the world, but now they are on Mount Zion in the heavens because they are ripe. Therefore, they were reaped into the heavens. To be reaped into the heavens is to be raptured into the heavens. Therefore, these verses refer to the rapture of the believers.</p>
<p>Those who are raptured are virgins; that is, they have never been defiled. They follow Christ wherever He goes, and there is no lie in their mouth; hence, they are without blemish. They are the firstfruits among God&rsquo;s harvest because this is their condition before the Lord. Since they are the firstfruits of God&rsquo;s harvest, they also are overcomers among the believers. Revelation 14:9 shows that after the firstfruits are raptured to the heavens, Antichrist is still able to work on earth. Furthermore, verse 12 shows there are still believers on earth who keep the Lord&rsquo;s word after the rapture of the firstfruits. On the one hand, the overcomers are raptured to the heavens as firstfruits before Antichrist appears, that is, before the great tribulation; on the other hand, the remaining believers as God&rsquo;s complete harvest are reaped, or raptured, to the air after Antichrist appears, that is, after the great tribulation begins. Revelation 14 clearly shows that some overcoming believers are raptured before the great tribulation, whereas most of the believers will pass through the great tribulation and only be raptured at the end. This portion proves that those who teach that all believers are raptured before the great tribulation and those who teach that all are raptured after the great tribulation are not correct.</p><h2 class="head2">The Time</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I also will keep you out of the hour of trial&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:10).</p>
<p>Since the overcoming believers are kept out of the hour of trial by rapture, this rapture must occur before the hour of trial, that is, before the great tribulation. If overcoming believers are not raptured before the great tribulation, how could they be kept from the hour of trial? Revelation 12 shows that the overcoming believers are raptured before the last three and a half years, that is, before the great tribulation (vv. 5-6, 14, 17), and Revelation 14 shows that Antichrist begins his actions during the great tribulation only after the overcomers are raptured as the firstfruits (vv. 1-5, 9-12). This clearly shows that the overcoming believers will be raptured before the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Place</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Stand before the Son of Man&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:36).</p>
<p>When the overcoming believers are raptured, they will stand before the Son of Man. This means they will be raptured to the heavens to stand before the ascended Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Caught up to God and to His throne&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 12:5).</p>
<p>The overcoming believers are raptured to God&rsquo;s throne. God&rsquo;s throne is in heaven (4:2), that is, in the third heaven (2 Cor. 12:2). Therefore, the overcoming believers are raptured to God&rsquo;s throne in the third heaven.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;On Mount Zion&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:1).</p>
<p>As the firstfruits, the overcomers will be with Christ on Mount Zion, which is the heavenly Zion (Heb. 12:22), not the earthly Mount Zion. This shows that the overcomers will be raptured to God&rsquo;s dwelling place on the heavenly Mount Zion.</p>
<p>These verses in the Bible clearly show that the overcoming believers are raptured to the heavens, that is, to the place where God lives and rules. It is the place where the Lord Jesus ascended. This is completely different from the rapture of the majority of the believers who will be raptured to the air. The rapture of the overcomers not only occurs at a different time than the rapture of the majority of the believers but also to a different place. The overcoming believers will be raptured before the great tribulation, whereas the majority of the believers will be raptured after the tribulation. The overcoming believers will be raptured to the third heaven, whereas the majority of the believers will be raptured to the air.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Requirements</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Be watchful at every time, beseeching&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:36).</p>
<p>One requirement for being raptured before the tribulation and escaping the great tribulation is to be watchful at every time, beseeching. This means that we should not be entangled in the affairs of the world but constantly live before the Lord and that we specifically beseech the Lord concerning being raptured to escape the great tribulation. This beseeching is not ordinary, general prayer but specific prayer for a certain matter: being raptured to escape the tribulation that will come upon the whole earth. In order to beseech the Lord in this way, there should not be anything between us and the Lord, nor should we be loose in any way. We must live before the Lord every moment and walk with the Lord every day. We must not say or do anything lightly, and all of our intentions and actions must be searched and restricted by the Lord. If this is our experience, we will constantly beseech the Lord concerning being raptured to escape the tribulation that is coming upon the earth. Only such persons will be considered worthy of escaping the coming tribulation and being raptured to stand before the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Watch...be ready&rdquo;; &ldquo;Waiting for their own master when he returns&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:42, 44; Luke 12:36).</p>
<p>If we want to enjoy the pretribulation rapture, we must not only watch and beseech; we must also watch and be ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. It is not enough just to beseech; we must also be ready. We must be ready to be raptured, to be taken away by the Lord at His coming, and to go forth and meet the Lord. All sins should be cleared up through confession, all matters should be cleared up, all that is required of us should be completed, all gifts for function should be fully used, and all ministries should be accomplished. We should not have any matter between us and the Lord, nor should we owe anything to any man. We should be ready in everything, waiting for the Lord to come. We should be ready to go as soon as the Lord calls. We should have nothing that binds or concerns us. Only those who are ready and waiting for the Lord can be raptured by the Lord before the coming of the great tribulation. Many believers, who are captivated by the affairs and things of the world, will not be ready.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Those who have loved His appearing&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p>A believer who is watchful and ready, waiting for the Lord, must be one who loves the Lord and who loves His appearing. When a wife loves her husband, she loves to see him every day. It is the same with us and the Lord. If we really love the Lord, we will love His appearing every moment. This is a requirement related to being raptured to escape the great tribulation.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You have kept the word of My endurance&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:10).</p>
<p>Keeping the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance will keep us out of the hour of trial that is about to come on the whole inhabited earth. Therefore, keeping the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance is a requirement related to being raptured to escape the great tribulation.</p>
<p>While we live on the earth, keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word is very important. We must do everything according to the Lord&rsquo;s word. Whether we are a full-time servant of the Lord or serve the Lord in a job, it is not easy to keep the Lord&rsquo;s word in everything. Endurance is needed because everything on the earth is against the Lord&rsquo;s word. Thus, if we would keep the Lord&rsquo;s word on this earth, we must endure all things. Keeping the Lord&rsquo;s word is equal to keeping the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance. This is a necessary requirement in order to be raptured to escape the great tribulation. If we would escape the tribulation that will come on the earth, we must endure the difficulties that this world imposes on us today. If we want to be raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s presence before the great tribulation, we must keep the word of the Lord&rsquo;s endurance in the midst of a troubling world today. This is the only way for us to be worthy of being raptured to see the Lord and to escape the tribulations that will come upon the earth.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;He who overcomes and he who keeps My works until the end&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:26).</p>
<p>Since the overcomers in this verse are equal to the overcomers spoken of in Revelation 12:5, who are raptured to God&rsquo;s throne before the great tribulation, being an overcomer is a requirement for being raptured before the great tribulation. Such an overcomer also keeps the Lord&rsquo;s works until the end. If we want to be worthy of being raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s presence to escape the great tribulation, we must keep the Lord&rsquo;s works until the end as an overcomer today.</p>
<p>May we pay attention to these five requirements to be raptured before the great tribulation. May we learn to be overcomers living before the Lord by watching, preparing, and waiting for Him to come!</p><h2 class="head1">THE RAPTURE OF THE MAJORITY<br />
OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Now let us consider the rapture of the majority of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Facts</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:16).</p>
<p>The rapture of the majority of the believers involves God&rsquo;s reaping of His harvest on earth. The believers are God&rsquo;s crop on the earth that has grown out of the seed that the Lord sowed while He was on the earth (Matt. 13:24-30, 36-43). Since that time, His harvest has been growing, and it will continue to grow until it is reaped when the majority of the believers are raptured. A small part of this harvest will be reaped first; that is, some will be raptured to the heavens before the beginning of the great tribulation as firstfruits to God and to Christ. They will be the first to be reaped and raptured because they will ripen first. The remaining part of the harvest, that is, the majority of the believers, will remain on the earth until the end of the great tribulation when the remaining harvest will be reaped and raptured. At this time, the Lord will leave His throne in the heavens and descend to the clouds in the air (cf. 26:64; Rev. 1:7; Acts 1:9-11). From this cloud, the Lord will thrust His sickle upon the earth; that is, He will send His angels to the earth (Matt. 13:30, 39). Then He will reap the remaining majority of His crop.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Persons Raptured</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:16-17; see also 1 Cor. 15:51-52).</p>
<p>The rapture of the majority of the believers will include all the believers from all the ages who are resurrected from the dead and all the believers who are alive and remain at the time of His second coming. With the exception of a small number of overcoming believers, the rest of the believers, both dead and living, will participate in this rapture.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Time</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;At the last trumpet&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:52).</p>
<p>Most of the believers will be raptured at the last trumpet, which is the trumpet of God spoken of in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. This trumpet is also the last of the seven trumpets spoken of in Revelation 8:2. <em>At the last trumpet</em> refers to the sounding of the seventh trumpet. At this time the great tribulation will be near its end (10:7; 11:14-18). Thus, most of the believers will be raptured at the sounding of the last trumpet, which occurs at the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;With regard to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him...It will not come unless...the man of lawlessness is revealed&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:1, 3).</p>
<p>Before the rapture of the majority of the believers, Antichrist must be revealed. This corresponds with Revelation 14:9-13, which shows that Antichrist will oppose the Lord on earth before the majority of the crop is reaped (vv. 14-16). The verses in 2 Thessalonians also show that Antichrist will be revealed and will oppose the Lord before the majority of the believers are raptured. These portions clearly prove that the majority of the believers will not be raptured until the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the majority of the believers will be raptured after the great tribulation, not before it. Teaching that all the believers will be raptured before the great tribulation is not accurate, because the Bible clearly says Antichrist will be revealed and will oppose the Lord before the majority of the believers are raptured. Antichrist will oppose the Lord during the last three and a half years before Christ&rsquo;s return, which is the great tribulation. Therefore, most of the believers will be left on earth to pass through the great tribulation before being raptured at its end.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Place</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We...will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:17).</p>
<p>The majority of the believers will be raptured to the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. At this time the Lord will descend from the heavens and sit upon a cloud. According to Revelation 14:14-16 the Lord will rapture them to meet Him in the air. This is completely different from the rapture of the overcoming believers to the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Requirement</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The harvest of the earth is ripe&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 14:15).</p>
<p>The one requirement related to the rapture of the majority of the believers is maturity in life. The believers are God&rsquo;s crop on the earth, and the rapture of the majority of the believers is the reaping of God&rsquo;s crop. In order to reap a crop, it must be ripe. The harvest being ripe implies the fullness of life and the loss of earthly water. The less there is of earthly water, the riper a harvest will be. A unripened harvest is lacking in the fullness of life and is full of earthly water. When the overcoming believers are raptured as the firstfruits, the majority of the believers will not be ripe. They will not be full of God&rsquo;s life. Instead, they will be full of earthly water; that is, they will still be dependent on an earthly supply. Since they are not weaned from earthly milk, God will leave them on the earth to pass through the trial of the great tribulation in order to cause them to ripen. The sufferings of the great tribulation will be like the shining of the hot sun that forces a crop to ripen. Even though they will be full of earthly water, and their connections to the earth will be deep, the hot sun of the great tribulation will shine on them and dry up the earthly water in them. It will shine on them until they no longer rely on the things of the earth. They will be forcibly weaned from the earthly milk. Today when we exhort such ones to love the Lord, they hesitate. When we exhort them to consecrate themselves, they weigh the costs. When we exhort them to deal with certain matters, they delay. When we exhort them to give up the world, they love it even more. But in that day they will not hesitate or weigh the costs. They will love the Lord absolutely and consecrate themselves without reservation. They will be forced to deal with the things that must be dealt with and give up what must be given up. On the one hand, they will know that some have been raptured, and on the other hand, the sufferings on the earth will force them to break their ties with the things on the earth. Therefore, their growth in life will be rapid, and they will spontaneously mature in life. By passing through the trials of the great tribulation, they will thoroughly ripen and meet the requirement for being raptured.</p>
<p>We must see that we are God&rsquo;s crop, and as His crop, we must thoroughly ripen before we can be reaped. No farmer reaps an unripened crop. We must be mature in life before we can be raptured. We must be ripe, or we cannot be reaped. If we do not ripen before the great tribulation, we will ripen later. If we do not love the Lord today and give ourselves to Him, we will love the Lord and give ourselves to Him later. If we do not deal with certain matters and give up the world today, we will deal with them and give up the world later. We must do these things, whether we do them earlier or later. We must ripen, whether we ripen earlier or later. If we do not ripen, the Lord cannot bring us into the enjoyment of His presence. The path to seeing the Lord&rsquo;s face requires ripening. If we do not take this path, we will not be raptured to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence. We should never think that the Lord will rapture us to His enjoyable presence even if we do not pursue Him or grow and ripen. This will never happen. The Lord will wait for us to ripen before He brings us into His heavenly storehouse, and the Lord will cause us to ripen so that He can reap us into His heavenly storehouse. If we do not allow Him to ripen us today, we will need to ripen in the future. If His grace in us today cannot accomplish this purpose, He will use trials in the future to accomplish it. His trials will cause us to ripen. They will force us to love and pursue Him and to give our all and leave the world. They will force us to reject the earthly water and be weaned from the world so that we can take Him as our everything. In this way our life will be completely filled with Him. We must be ripened in this way before He can reap us.</p>
<p>Most believers consider the Lord&rsquo;s second coming and our rapture simply as matters to be prophetically fulfilled in time, but the Bible shows that the Lord&rsquo;s second coming and our rapture are also matters of life. They are related not only to time but also to our maturity of life. More than the passage of time is needed in order for the Lord to return and for our rapture to occur. Growth and maturity in life are needed to hasten the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming and our rapture. Can the Lord come back to believers who are in a general condition of immaturity? Can such believers be raptured? The Lord will return to reap a ripened crop. However, if the harvest is still green and if we are not ripe, how can He reap us as His harvest? If He comes when we are immature and unripe, what could He reap? He must wait for a loud voice from heaven to shout, &ldquo;The harvest of the earth is ripe.&rdquo; Only then will He thrust His sickle down to the earth, that is, send His angels to the earth to reap, or rapture, us. Being completely mature is a requirement for rapture. We must ripen, and we must ripen completely before we can be raptured.</p>
<p>We have spoken of two <em>kinds</em> of believers being raptured, but this does not mean that there are only two <em>times</em> of rapture. The Bible shows that there are several times of rapture. In addition to two kinds of rapture, the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers, the Bible also speaks of at least three different times of rapture: Revelation 7:9; 11:12; and 15:2. Three of the portions we quoted in this chapter concerning the rapture of the overcoming believers&mdash;Matthew 24:40-41; Revelation 12:5; and Revelation 14:1-5&mdash;also reveal differences in relation to one another. These portions were included to show, at the very least, that there are two different kinds of rapture, namely, the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY</h1>

<p>Thank the Lord, we have studied fifty-nine topics, and now we have come to the last topic: the second coming of Christ. This is a great matter in the Bible, especially in the New Testament. There are many prophecies in the Bible that speak of the second coming of Christ. This is an important topic because it closely relates to our destiny, our future. The second coming of Christ serves as a consolation and hope as well as a reminder and warning to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROMISE OF THE SECOND COMING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Son of Man is to come&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:27; see also 24:30, 44, 46; Luke 18:8; 21:27).</p>
<p>When the Lord was on the earth, He promised His disciples that He would return. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is a matter of His personal promise.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;This Jesus...will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:11).</p>
<p>The angels promised the disciples that the Lord would come in the same way that they beheld Him going into heaven. This promise has not yet been fulfilled. May the Lord not delay, and may we even compel Him to come quickly (Heb. 10:37; see also 2 Pet. 3:3-4, 9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND COMING FULFILLING THE NEEDS OF<br />
THE BELIEVERS, THE JEWS, AND THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>The second coming of Christ fulfills the needs of the believers, the Jews, and the Gentiles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ...will appear a second time to those who eagerly await Him...unto salvation&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:28).</p>
<p>The believers, who have been redeemed by the Lord, still need His full salvation. Our bodies have weakness and sickness. With sufferings in the world and troubles surrounding us, we still need the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. The Lord&rsquo;s second coming will accomplish this full salvation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:20-21; see also 1 John 3:2; Col. 3:4; 2 Thes. 1:10).</p>
<p>Although believers are regenerated in spirit and have become a new creation in Christ (John 3:6; 2 Cor. 5:17), our body is still in the old creation and in need of being conformed to the body of His glory. Being in the old creation, our body has many weaknesses and problems. Some people have sicknesses and diseases related to the lungs, the stomach, the kidneys, and the heart. Some are blind, and some are deaf. All these conditions show that the condition of our body needs to be changed. This change will occur when the Lord returns. When the Lord returns, He will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to the operation by which He is able to subject all things to Himself. Thus, we will be like Him in every part of our being from our spirit to our body, and we will be manifested with Him in glory.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Unto the coming of the Lord...the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:15-17; see also 1 Cor. 15:51-52).</p>
<p>The dead believers will be transfigured through resurrection, and the living believers will be transfigured through rapture. Both the resurrection of the dead believers and the rapture of the living believers will occur at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. At this time the Lord will cause the dead believers to rise and change, making them incorruptible, and He will change and catch the living believers up together with them in the clouds to meet Him and be with Him always.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You have need of endurance...&lsquo;For in yet a very little while the Coming One will come and will not delay&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:36-37).</p>
<p>Many of the hardships that believers face in the world will be resolved only when the Lord comes again. We need endurance to wait for the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, but when He comes, all our problems will be solved.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;He will carry out their avenging...When the Son of Man comes&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 18:8; see also Rev. 6:10; 2 Thes. 1:6-9).</p>
<p>The persecution and wrongs that the believers suffer on earth will be avenged only when the Lord returns. At that time the Lord will exercise vengeance according to His righteousness on all who persecuted His believers. Although He knows that we suffer from man&rsquo;s persecution and requires us to turn the other cheek to those who strike us, He will judge each of these matters to avenge His believers through His ruling authority in the universe.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The Son of Man is to come...and then He will repay each man according to his doings&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:27; see also Rev. 22:12).</p>
<p>The believers&rsquo; actions on earth need to be judged and will be judged by the Lord at His second coming. At that time the Lord will repay each of us according to our doings.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 19:7).</p>
<p>As believers, we are betrothed to the Lord (2 Cor. 11:2); we belong to Him. Our marriage, that is, our complete union with Him, is related to His second coming. <em>His wife</em> refers to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). According to Revelation 19:8-9, the wife in verse 7, the bride of Christ, consists only of the overcoming believers during the millennium. In contrast, the bride, the wife, in Revelation 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity. The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. The marriage of the Lamb to His overcoming believers will take place when the Lord returns. Then the Lord will be joined with those who love Him, and He and they will become one.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:4, see also v. 6; 2 Tim. 2:12).</p>
<p>In order for the overcoming believers to reign with the Lord, He must return. When He returns, the overcoming believers will reign with Him for a thousand years.</p>
<p>The preceding points speak of the need for the Lord&rsquo;s second coming with respect to the believers in general and to the overcoming believers in particular. At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming He will save, change, avenge, and fully repay the believers, and He will be joined with the overcoming believers to reign with them for a thousand years. The Lord&rsquo;s return meets these needs of the believers.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning the Jews</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All Israel will be saved, as it is written, &lsquo;The Deliverer will come out of Zion; He will turn away ungodliness from Jacob&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 11:26; see also Zech. 12:10; 13:1).</p>
<p>Although the Jews are God&rsquo;s chosen people, they have strayed far from God. But even though they strayed from Him, God has not given up on them. Therefore, He will save them at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. When the Lord returns, He will be the Deliverer of the Jews, the house of Jacob, and He will turn away their ungodliness. Thus, the entire house of Israel will be saved. God will pour out the Spirit of grace and of supplications upon them. They will look upon Him whom they have pierced, and they will repent and believe in the Lord (12:10). Then there will be an opened fountain to wash away sin and impurity, and they will be cleansed (13:1). This opened fountain is Christ&rsquo;s pierced side.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives...and the Mount of Olives will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west into a very great valley...And you will flee into the valley of My mountains&rdquo;</strong> (Zech. 14:4-5).</p>
<p>Antichrist will lead the great armies of the nations to surround and attack the Jews and to destroy Jerusalem. When there is no way to escape from his attack, the Lord will return, and His feet will stand upon the Mount of Olives, the mountain from which He ascended (Acts 1:9-12). The Mount of Olives outside of Jerusalem will be split at its middle toward the east and toward the west forming a very great valley through which the Jews will escape and be saved. This will be like the Israelites&rsquo; escape from Pharaoh&rsquo;s pursuit through the Red Sea after they left Egypt. When there was no way of escape, God opened the Red Sea so that they could be saved.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins and erect it again&rdquo;; &ldquo;He will reign over the house of Jacob&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 15:16; Luke 1:33).</p>
<p>Even though the Jews lost their nation and the kingly throne of the house of David disappeared from among them, God promised that He would restore the nation of Israel, that is, the kingdom of the Jews with the kingship of the house of David. This will be fulfilled at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. According to the flesh, the Lord came out of the seed of David (Rom. 1:3; John 7:42). According to the genealogy in Matthew 1, He is the legal heir to the throne of David. When the Lord returns, He will rebuild the tabernacle of David; that is, He will restore the kingdom of David, which will be the restoration of the nation of Israel, and He will be the King of the Jews, the house of Israel. Then all the matters recorded in Jeremiah 23:5-6; Isaiah 14:1-2; 35:8-10; 65:19-25; and 66:20-21 will be fulfilled.</p>
<p>The preceding points speak of the need for the Lord&rsquo;s second coming with respect to the Jews. The salvation of the Jews and the restoration of their kingdom are related to His return.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Nations</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Indeed, in those days... / I will gather all the nations / And will bring them down to the valley of Jehoshaphat; / And I will enter into judgment with them there... / There cause Your mighty ones to descend, O Jehovah!... / Come, tread, / For the winepress is full; / The wine vats overflow, / For their evil is great&rdquo;</strong> (Joel 3:1-2, 11, 13; see also Zech. 14:2-5, 12-13; Rev. 14:17-20; 19:11-21).</p>
<p>Man will never be able to resolve the problems of this world. Man even has a difficult time dealing with the problems of the world. The problems of the world are like a pile of tangled string that great men of every age have been unable to unravel. They have not been able to solve the messy situations in the world; they have only created a greater degree of entanglement to the point that the pile of string has become one big knot. According to the present world situation, the Lord Jesus must return in order for the world&rsquo;s problems to be resolved.</p>
<p>When He returns, the Lord will deal with the powers that have rebelled against Him on the earth. He will gather Antichrist and his armies of the nations to the valley of Jehoshaphat outside of Jerusalem below the Mount of Olives to execute judgment on them. The Lord will appear as a mighty One to make war with all who oppose and rebel against Him. He will tread upon them as if He were treading grapes in a wine vat. The Lord will attack them so that their flesh will shrivel, their eyes will dry in their sockets, and their tongues will rot. They will be totally destroyed by the Lord, and birds will eat their flesh. The leaders of these rebellious nations, Antichrist and the false prophet, will be captured and cast alive into the lake of fire. This is how the Lord will deal with the rebellious powers on the earth.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and cast him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, that he might not deceive the nations any longer&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:2-3).</p>
<p>When He returns, the Lord also will deal with the Devil, who corrupts the world and deceives the nations. The Devil is the source of all disasters and confusion in the world. If he is not cast out, the world will have no peace. When the Lord returns, an angel will lay hold of the Devil, bind him, cast him into the abyss, and seal it so that he cannot make mischief, deceive the nations, or damage the world.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory. And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:31-32).</p>
<p>When He returns, the Lord will also judge the nations living on the earth. He will sit on the throne of His glory, and all the nations of the earth will be gathered before Him to be judged. He will separate the living people of the nations, just as a shepherd separates sheep from goats, counting those who are good as righteous and allowing them to enter into His earthly kingdom to enjoy its earthly blessings. He also will condemn those who are evil and wicked and send them to the lake of fire prepared for the devil and his angels to be punished eternally. Thus, the Lord will deal with all the problems among the nations. The section in chapter 57 on the judgment before Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory details the Lord&rsquo;s judgment upon the living nations at His second coming.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 11:15; see also Zech. 14:9).</p>
<p>After the Lord returns and clears up the problems on earth, He will establish His kingdom on the earth, and the earth will become His kingdom. The Lord will be the King over all the earth and will exercise righteousness so that the earth will be peaceful and blessed (Isa. 32:1; 2:4; 11:1-9).</p>
<p>The preceding points refer to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming with respect to the nations of the world. The Lord&rsquo;s return is needed in order to deal with the powers of evil on earth, to cast out the devil, and to punish the evil. The Lord&rsquo;s return also is needed in order to make the earth a healthy, happy place. When the Lord returns, He will deal with every negative thing and person so that the earth will be a peaceful, blissful kingdom in which man can enjoy the blessings prepared for him from the foundation of the world (Matt. 25:34).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s second coming fulfills the needs of the believers, the Jews, and the nations. The problems afflicting the believers, the Jews, and the nations will be resolved only with the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. Once He returns, the problems of every kind of person on earth will be solved.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEFINITION OF THE SECOND COMING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jesus...will come in the same way as you beheld Him going into heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:11).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;come&rdquo; here is <em>erchomai,</em> and it literally means &ldquo;to come.&rdquo; This shows that the Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be an actual coming; it is not just a figure of speech. Throughout the ages some in Christianity have thought that the biblical references to the Lord&rsquo;s return were merely metaphoric, not references to an actual coming. For example, some have said that the Lord&rsquo;s second coming refers to the soul and spirit of a believer seeing the Lord when he dies. Acts 1:11, however, says that the Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be as real as His ascension. He will come in the same way that He ascended into heaven. He went into heaven in a cloud (v. 9), and He will return on a cloud (Matt. 24:30; 26:64; Rev. 1:7). Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be an actual and physical coming.</p>
<p>Others in Christianity have said that the second coming of Christ refers to a time when the gospel has been preached to the entire earth and all the people on earth have been Christianized. This teaching is utterly ridiculous. According to the Bible, not everyone on earth will receive Christ. On the contrary, the Bible shows that people will become utterly evil and be judged by the Lord. The Lord will actually come to judge the world. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is not a figure of speech, nor does it refer to something that is only spiritual. His coming will be actual and physical.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord Himself...will descend from heaven&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:16).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;descend&rdquo; here is <em>katabaino,</em> and it literally means &ldquo;to descend.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be a descent. Since the Lord ascended to the heavens, He surely will descend from the heavens at His second coming. This verse also says that the Lord Himself will descend from heaven. Therefore, He will come physically.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The revelation of Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:7; see also 1 Cor. 1:7).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;revelation&rdquo; here is <em>apokalupsis,</em> and it literally means &ldquo;unveiling,&rdquo; or &ldquo;revelation.&rdquo; This unveiling is like the opening of a curtain that allows people to see something that was concealed. Thus, it is a revelation. The Lord Jesus is concealed today, as if behind a curtain in the heavens where no one can see Him. But when He returns, the curtain of the heavens will be opened to reveal Him so that all will see Him.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The coming of the Son of Man&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:27, 37, 39; see also 2 Pet. 1:16).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;coming&rdquo; here is <em>parousia,</em> and it literally means &ldquo;presence.&rdquo; The same word is translated as &ldquo;presence&rdquo; in Philippians 2:12. To His believers the Lord&rsquo;s return will involve His presence with them. The Lord&rsquo;s presence will begin before the great tribulation when the overcoming believers are raptured (see chapter 59) and last until the end of the great tribulation when the Lord will descend to reveal Himself to the world. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His <em>parousia,</em> will last for a period of three and a half years, which will be the last half of the last seven years of the church age. During this time the Lord will rapture believers into His presence at different times. With respect to the believers, His coming involves their rapture to His presence; with respect to the Lord, His presence involves His coming to the believers.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 6:14; see also 2 Tim. 4:1, 8; Titus 2:13).</p>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;appearing&rdquo; here is <em>epiphaneia,</em> and it literally means &ldquo;appearing, manifestation.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s appearing is something more than revelation (<em>apokalupsis</em>). Revelation involves the opening of a curtain, and appearing involves the manifestation of oneself.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The manifestation of His coming&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:8).</p>
<p>The coming (<em>parousia</em>) of the Lord is over a period of time. The Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> will start when the Lord raptures the overcomers to heaven to be with Him before the beginning of the great tribulation. Beginning at this time, the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em>, that is, His coming, will last for three and a half years until His appearance is manifested. This manifestation (<em>epiphaneia</em>), or appearance, is what the Bible calls the manifestation (<em>epiphaneia</em>) of His coming (<em>parousia</em>). The Lord&rsquo;s return involves a period of time, the <em>parousia</em> (coming), and a point in time, the <em>epiphaneia</em> (manifestation). The <em>parousia</em> (coming) is a longer period of time; the <em>epiphaneia</em> (manifestation) is a short point in time. His manifestation will be a point in time at the end of a longer period of time of His coming; therefore, 2 Thessalonians speaks of the <em>epiphaneia</em> of His <em>parousia</em>.</p>
<p>In order to understand the Lord&rsquo;s return, we must understand the word <em>parousia.</em> If we do not understand that this word refers to His coming over a period of time, we will not understand why the Lord&rsquo;s return begins before the great tribulation but does not consummate until the end of the tribulation, a period of three and a half years. We will also be unable to understand why some places in the Bible speak of the Lord coming before the great tribulation, and other places speak of His coming after the great tribulation. If we see that the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is a <em>parousia,</em> that is, a coming over a period of time, these questions will be answered. Since the Lord&rsquo;s second coming involves a period of time, there will be a lengthy period from its beginning to its end, beginning before the great tribulation and ending at the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is an actual coming and that the Lord Himself will descend from the heavens to be manifested before men. His coming with respect to His believers involves a long period of time, the time of His presence, which begins before the great tribulation and ends at the end of the great tribulation. It will last for three and a half years. At the end of the great tribulation, the coming of His presence will be manifested when He comes to earth to appear to men. His coming is hidden and secret at the beginning and manifested and open at the end. In order to understand the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, we must understand and remember these fine details, or we will not be clear.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HIDDEN AND THE OPEN ASPECTS<br />
OF THE SECOND COMING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Hidden Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into&rdquo;; &ldquo;If therefore you will not watch, I will come as a thief&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:43; Rev. 3:3; see also 16:15).</p>
<p>One aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming involves a coming that is hidden and secret, like the coming of a thief in the night. The hidden and secret aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming occurs before the beginning of the great tribulation; it is not related to His manifestation at the end of the great tribulation. We need to watch and be ready in order to participate in this hidden and secret aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Open Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Just as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be...All the tribes of the land will...see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:27, 30).</p>
<p>Although there is a secret and hidden aspect of His coming, which will be seen only by those who are watchful, the Bible also speaks of His coming as lightening across the sky, which will be seen openly by everyone. These are not contradictory speakings, because these portions speak of two different aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming: the hidden, secret aspect and the manifested, open aspect. The hidden aspect is His <em>parousia,</em> and the open aspect is His <em>epiphaneia.</em> The Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia,</em> the coming of His presence, secretly begins before the great tribulation. At this time the Lord will come and secretly rapture the overcoming believers to His presence, just as a thief steals precious things. The Lord considers His lovers, His overcoming believers, to be precious. Before the great tribulation comes upon the earth, the Lord will come secretly in a hidden way when people least expect it to rapture His beloved overcoming believers to the heavens to His presence. When He does this, it will seem as if He has stolen His beloved believers. When He steals these believers by rapturing them, they will be gone before people realize that they are missing, just as precious things are gone before a householder realizes that a thief has broken into his house. Before the great tribulation, the Lord will come to steal, to rapture, the overcoming believers. This is the hidden aspect of His second coming at the beginning of His <em>parousia.</em></p>
<p>At the end of the great tribulation, however, the Lord will descend from heaven and be manifested. He will descend on the clouds and appear in the sky. His coming will be sudden like lightening, but all the people on earth will be able to see it. This is the open aspect of His second coming at the manifestation of His <em>parousia.</em></p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s second coming involves a hidden aspect and an open aspect. Only watchful, overcoming believers who are waiting for Him will participate in the hidden aspect. All the world will see the open aspect, and all believers will participate in it. If we want to participate in the hidden aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, having a part at the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia,</em> we must be a watchful, ready overcomer waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. If we are not, we will participate only in the open aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, the <em>epiphaneia,</em> the manifestation of His coming, at the end of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TIME OF THE SECOND COMING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Hidden Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Concerning that day and hour, no one knows&rdquo;; &ldquo;Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:36, 42; see also 25:13; Rev. 3:3).</p>
<p>No one knows the hour or day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. This refers to the hidden aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. No one knows the day and hour, because it is hidden. Therefore, we must be watchful!</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Like a thief in the night, so the day of the Lord comes&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:2, see also v. 4; 2 Pet. 3:10).</p>
<p>The day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is like a thief in the night. This refers to the hidden aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. Since the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is like a thief in the night, no one knows the day of His second coming.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Open Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The day of the Lord...will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:2-3).</p>
<p>Although the Bible says that no one knows the day of the Lord&rsquo;s return, these verses suggest that it is possible to know the general time of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming because the apostasy must come and the man of lawlessness, the son of perdition, must be revealed before the second aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s coming is fulfilled. When people see the apostasy and the manifestation of Antichrist, the day of the Lord&rsquo;s coming is near. These verses refer to the open aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. The open aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be at the end of the great tribulation, but Antichrist will be manifested before that day.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The lawless one...(whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming)&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:8).</p>
<p>The Lord will use the manifestation of His coming to bring Antichrist to nothing, that is, to destroy him. This is related to the open aspect of His return. According to Revelation 13:5, this will occur at the end of the three and a half years (forty-two months) of the great tribulation. The time of the hidden aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s coming cannot be determined, because there is no basis on which to make such a determination. No one can determine when His hidden coming will begin. However, the open aspect of the day of the Lord&rsquo;s return will be at the end of the great tribulation, that is, after Antichrist has been operating on earth for forty-two months. When Antichrist begins to openly operate, it will be possible to more closely know when the Lord will return.</p>
<p>The hidden aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s return will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation, and the open aspect will occur at the end of the great tribulation. Between the hidden aspect and the open aspect, there will be a period of at least three and a half years. This is similar to the period of time between packing luggage for travel and actually boarding an airplane. The time of packing and preparing our luggage is hidden, but the time of boarding an airplane is open for all to see. At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s return, only the Lord&rsquo;s overcomers will participate in the hidden, preparatory aspect, but all the believers will participate in the open, manifested aspect. The overcoming believers will be raptured at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s hidden coming; they will participate in His <em>parousia.</em> The remainder of the believers will be raptured prior to the Lord&rsquo;s open, manifested coming; they will participate in His <em>epiphaneia.</em> No one can determine or know when the overcoming believers will be raptured, but it is possible to determine and know when the rest of the believers will be raptured. The overcomers will be raptured before the great tribulation at the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia,</em> and the remaining believers will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation at the manifestation of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia.</em></p><h2 class="head1">THE PLACE OF THE SECOND COMING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Hidden Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In the clouds...in the air&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:17; see also Psa. 18:9, 11).</p>
<p>The Lord will return to the clouds in the air during the hidden aspect of His coming. Before the Lord descends to the clouds in the air, He will rapture the overcomers to God&rsquo;s throne in the heavens (Rev. 12:5). When the Lord descends from the heavens to the clouds in the air, the overcoming believers will descend with Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Open Aspect</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east&rdquo;</strong> (Zech. 14:4).</p>
<p>The Lord will return to the earth during the open aspect of His coming. When the Lord returns, His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem. This is His descent to the surface of the earth. This is different from His descent to the clouds in the air. He will descend to the clouds in the air from the throne in the heavens, and then He will descend to the surface of the earth from the clouds in the air. His descent from the throne in the heavens to the clouds in the air is His <em>parousia.</em> Only the overcomers who have been raptured will participate in it. His descent from the clouds in the air to the surface of the earth is His <em>epiphaneia,</em> the manifestation of His <em>parousia.</em> All believers who are raptured at the end of the great tribulation will participate in it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNS OF THE SECOND COMING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;What will be the sign of Your coming?&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:3).</p>
<p>There are signs related to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. When the disciples asked the Lord what the sign of His coming would be, the Lord gave them some signs. These signs remind us to be watchful and ready while we wait for the Lord. When we see these signs, the Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be near, and we should be watchful and ready, waiting for Him to come.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these things are the beginning of birth pangs&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:7-8).</p>
<p>These verses speak of three signs related to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming: wars, famines, and earthquakes. Nation (people) fighting against nation denotes civil war, and kingdom fighting against kingdom denotes international war. These two types of fighting will occur frequently in the last days. History also shows that famine follows war. In the last days there will be many wars and severe famines. Over nineteen hundred years ago, when the Lord spoke this word concerning earthquakes, there were very few earthquakes, but now earthquakes occur almost daily. It is common to read about earthquakes in the newspapers today. Geologists tell us that the movement of the earth is increasing. The appearance of these disasters on the earth are signs that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is drawing near.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, not lovers of good, traitors, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having an outward form of godliness, though denying its power&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 3:1-5).</p>
<p>These verses describe the condition of human society at the end of this age. Each of the things spoken of here can be called a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. The first condition is that men will be lovers of self and lovers of money. Today it is hard to find anyone who does not love himself or love money. In the last days men will love themselves the most, followed closely by money. Man&rsquo;s &ldquo;lover&rdquo; will be money. There also will be boasting, arrogance, reviling, and the blaspheming of God. People today are more boastful, arrogant, reviling, and blasphemous than they ever were in the past. Being disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, and implacable are also special characteristics of society in the last days. Today there are people who teach and without natural promote disobedience to parents and being unthankful, unholy, affection, and implacable. Such ones are nearly the same as beasts. Today there are also many who are slanderers, without self-control, savage, and nonlovers of good, who are traitors, reckless, and blinded with pride. People today do not want to be restricted; they all do things recklessly and arrogantly under the guise of freedom. It is also a particular characteristic of people today to be lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. Pleasure is simply entertainment, involving all kinds of amusement. People today are lovers of pleasure. Movie theaters are full for almost every show, and often there are no empty seats at bars and dance halls. Gambling and travel are also frequent pleasures among people today. There are pleasures for those in the upper class and pleasures for those in the lower classes. People love every kind of pleasure, but they do not love God. Furthermore, they have an outward form of godliness but deny its power. These are all signs of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, and they should remind us that we must watch and be prepared for the Lord to come.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You have stored up treasure in the last days&rdquo;</strong> (James 5:3).</p>
<p>In the last days people will love to store up treasure because they will be lovers of money. This is a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage...Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 17:26-28).</p>
<p>These verses describe the condition of the people in the days of Noah: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, and they were being given in marriage. When speaking of the condition of the people in the days of Lot, the condition of buying, selling, planting, and building are added. According to the Lord, the condition of the people in the day of His return will be the same as it was in the days of Noah and Lot. Eating, drinking, marrying, being given in marriage, buying, selling, planting, and building seemingly are the most important matters in human society today. People strongly promote these matters. Nothing that a person does today can be separated from these things. The emphasis on these matters is a strong sign that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is near.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 4:1).</p>
<p>Some will depart from the faith and listen to the heretical, evil teachings of demons. This will also be a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;They will not tolerate the healthy teaching; but according to their own lusts they will heap up to themselves teachers, having itching ears, and they will turn away their ear from the truth and will be turned aside to myths&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:3-4).</p>
<p>Another sign of the Lord&rsquo;s coming is that people will not tolerate the healthy teaching but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers, have itching ears, and turn away their ears from the truth and be turned aside to myths. Believers today truly are in this condition. If we speak the healthy teaching to them, they feel it is dry and boring, and they become restless. They like to hear myths and teachings that are according to their own lusts. This is an abnormal condition and tells us that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is near.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;In the last of days mockers will come with mocking, going on according to their own lusts and saying, Where is the promise of His coming?&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 3:3-4; see also 2:1-2).</p>
<p>In the last days some will deny and even mock the promise of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. This will be a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes, will He find faith on the earth?&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 18:8).</p>
<p>By the time of His second coming, many of the believers will have little faith. A lack of faith among believers is a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:14).</p>
<p>According to this verse, the gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come. The preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the whole inhabited earth is a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Learn the parable from the fig tree: As soon as its branch has become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near. So also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:32-33; see also Luke 21:29-31).</p>
<p>The fig tree represents the nation of Israel. In Matthew 21:18-20 the fig tree, the symbol of the nation of Israel, was cursed by the Lord and withered because it did not produce fruit for Him. The Jews lost their nation and were scattered. According to prophecies in the Bible, however, the Jews will recover their nation. The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the fig tree branch becoming tender and putting forth its leaves refers to this matter. When Israel, like the fig tree, becomes tender and puts forth leaves, the Lord said that His coming would be near. The recovery of the nation of Israel is another sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p>The Jews have recovered their nation and now are a member of the United Nations as the nation of Israel. Many of the Jews who were scattered around the world have returned to their own soil in Palestine. Despite the fact that the old part of the city of Jerusalem and the temple mount are still in Arab hands, they have made their capital in the new part of Jerusalem. [Editor&rsquo;s note: The content in this chapter was prepared in 1949, prior to the Six Days&rsquo; War in 1967, during which time all of Jerusalem and the temple mount were regained by the nation of Israel.] These are signs that the withered fig tree is growing tender in its branches and putting forth new leaves. When we see these things, we should know that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is near.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;When they say, Peace and security, then sudden destruction comes upon them&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:3).</p>
<p>People in the world desire peace and security, but when they say, &ldquo;Peace and security,&rdquo; that is, when they feel safe and peaceful, sudden destruction will come upon them. Therefore, it is a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming when worldly people speak of peace and security.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;It will not come unless the apostasy comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of perdition&rdquo;; &ldquo;It is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:3, 7).</p>
<p>Before the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, the apostasy will come, and the man of lawlessness, Antichrist, will be revealed. These things are signs of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. Although Antichrist has not yet been revealed, the mystery of lawlessness is already operating on the earth so the earth is filled with apostasy. This tells us that the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming is not far off.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;When you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let him who reads understand)&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:15).</p>
<p>The prophecy spoken of through Daniel indicates that the abomination of desolation will occur in the &ldquo;middle of the week&rdquo; (9:27), the last half of the final seven years of the church age. In the middle of this week, Antichrist will set up the abomination of desolation in the holy place. According to 2 Thessalonians 2:4, <em>holy place</em> refers to the temple of God. Antichrist will set up an abominable idol of desolation, an image of himself (Rev. 13:14; 14:9, 11), in the temple and make people worship it. This shows that the temple in Jerusalem will be restored. When the great tribulation, the last three and a half years, is about to begin, Antichrist will set up his image in the temple. When this happens, the day of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming will be very close. This is the reason that the Lord said, &ldquo;Let him who reads understand.&rdquo; The abomination of desolation in the temple is a certain sign of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. We should have no desire to be on earth to see the fulfillment of this prophecy; instead, our hope should be focused on being raptured by the Lord from the earth to His presence before the three and a half years of the great tribulation.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;There will be signs in the sun and moon and stars, and upon the earth anguish of nations...for the powers of the heavens will be shaken&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:25-26).</p>
<p>When the Lord&rsquo;s coming is very near, there will be extraordinary changes to the situation in the heavens and on earth. There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and there will be anguish among the nations on earth. The powers of the heavens will be shaken. These matters will be signs of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming, and they will be some of the last signs.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; RESPONSE<br />
TO THE LORD&rsquo;S SECOND COMING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Watch therefore...Be ready&rdquo;; &ldquo;Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning...Be like men waiting for their own master&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 24:42, 44; Luke 12:35-36; see also Matt. 25:10, 13).</p>
<p>We should respond to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming by being watchful and ready, waiting for Him. Our loins should be girded, and our lamps should be burning. We should not be loose but instead testify for the Lord. It is only right to be watchful and ready, waiting for the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:20; see also Heb. 9:28; 1 Thes. 1:10).</p>
<p>We should be those on the earth who are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. We should not be those who are merely saved, but even more, those who are waiting for the Lord to come. Our hope today should not be on any person, matter, or thing upon the earth. Our only hope should be on our coming Lord. If our hope is on something other than the Lord, we will have a problem with Him, and we will be a defeated believer. When our hope is placed on Him, we will be those who are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. That is how to be a proper, overcoming believer.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Those who have loved His appearing&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:8).</p>
<p>If we are waiting for the Lord, we must also be those who love His appearing. Our heart should desire the Lord&rsquo;s second coming. We should lovingly think of His appearing. Our heart should not be rooted to the earth; it should ascend above it to be with the Lord. This was the heart of the early apostles. Miss M. E. Barber also lived with such a love for the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. Their hearts were not tied to any person, matter, or thing on this earth. Those who wait for the Lord&rsquo;s coming and love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing will overcome.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:3; see also 2:28).</p>
<p>If we are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming and love His appearing, we will purify ourselves, even as He is pure. In this way we will be bold when He comes, and we will not be put to shame before Him. No one waiting for the Lord can live a filthy life. No one who loves the Lord&rsquo;s appearing can allow himself to be stained with any impurity or mixture. We must forsake everything that is filthy and remove all mixture if we want to be worthy of waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. We must purify ourselves, even as He is pure, to be worthy of the hope of His appearing, of seeing His holy face, and of being transfigured into His glorious image.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:20).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; is the last prayer recorded in the Bible. It expresses a believer&rsquo;s ultimate desire before the Lord. This is the attitude that we should have toward Him. This should be the attitude, desire, and prayer of everyone who is waiting for the Lord and who loves His appearing. May our heart desire the Lord&rsquo;s coming, and may our attitude be positive toward His coming. May we pray with a desperately desiring heart and an absolute attitude, &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</p></body></html>
