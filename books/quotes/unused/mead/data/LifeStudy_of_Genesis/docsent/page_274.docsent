   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Melchisedec's coming signified that Christ had come.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our victory always makes Christ manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The people in our environment may find it difficult to see where Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, if we gain a victory, that victory will declare Christ to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our victory will bring in Christ in a new aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How interesting it is to see that suddenly, in chapter fourteen of Genesis, Melchisedec, whose name means the king of righteousness and who was the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does this signify?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It signifies that Christ will be declared to people and brought to them by the overcoming ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One day the whole earth will be surprised by Christ's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The people in the world do not even believe that there is a Christ, calling such belief nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But after we have slaughtered all of the kings, Christ will suddenly appear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ will be made manifest by our slaughter of the kings, and the whole world will be surprised at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To us, the overcomers, Christ's second appearing will not be a surprise, but to the worldly people it will be a great surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They may say, "Who is this one?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is his name and where does he come from?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may answer, "His name is Christ, the real Melchisedec, and He comes from the heavens where He has been interceding for centuries."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to echo the Lord's intercession.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we turn to our spirit and contact Him, there will always be some echoing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we go according to that echoing, forgetting our environment, enemies, and even ourselves, we shall gain the victory and slaughter the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end of our slaughter of all the kings, our Melchisedec will appear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That will be the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When Christ comes in, the whole earth will know the Most High God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then all the earth will realize that God is the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The earth is not possessed by any king, president, statesman, or politician, it is possessed by the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can this fact be declared to the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only by our slaughter of the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abraham's victory in chapter fourteen is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Bible, God is revealed in a progressive way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Genesis 1 we do not have the title, "the Most High God."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even up to chapter thirteen we have neither this title nor the special title, "Possessor of heaven and earth."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although you may have been a Christian for years, perhaps you have never realized that God has such titles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God is the Most High God and the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the heavenlord and the landlord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By our experience of Christ, God's titles are progressively revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our experience of Christ, we shall realize that our God is the Most High God and the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This must be our attraction and incentive to go on to slaughter the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not be today's Lot, for that is to be timid and cowardly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all must be brief and bold because we have the Most High God and the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abraham told the king of Sodom that, before he went to war, he lifted up his hand to the Most High God, to the Possessor of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He went to war in such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Since Abraham had full confidence in the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth, he had to be victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Melchisedec came to Abraham, he blessed Abraham with the Most High God, the Possessor of heaven and earth v. 19 . This proves that he was greater than Abraham Heb 7:6-7 . He also blessed God for Abraham's victory v. 20 . Our victory always causes our Melchisedec to grant us blessing and to give blessing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our victory brings in more blessings in Christ, both to us and to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At Melchisedec's blessing, Abraham gave him tithes of all, the tithes of his choice spoils v. 20; Heb 7:2, 4 . This also proves Melchisedec's greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our victory gains the spoils, and the offering of our spoils to Christ always declares the greatness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Without victory, we have nothing to offer to Christ and His greatness will not be declared.</S>
