<h1 class="title">ALLOWING GOD TO WORK IN US<br />
AND WORKING ACCORDING TO<br />
THE SPIRITUAL NEED</h1>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p>After a period of time many believers begin to doubt their salvation and look for proof and assurance of their salvation. Brother Nee once said that the fact a person doubts his salvation is proof that he is saved. A person who has never doubted his salvation has not been saved. This means that we should neither doubt the condition of our salvation or the fact of our salvation.</p>
<p>Whenever we speak of our own salvation, we do not necessarily feel that it is something tremendous. All our spiritual experiences have ups and downs. After experiencing salvation, a believer is joyful and buoyant, but after a period of time he begins to doubt his salvation and is no longer joyful. Our experiences concerning knowing ourselves, consecration, the cross, and following the Lord are similar to the experiences of a new believer. Every believer goes through a period of time when his spiritual condition is up, a time when he is willing to serve God, to take the cross, and to pray. Then after a point in time his spiritual condition goes down. Actually, his condition may not be going down, but he feels that he has not learned a particular lesson or that he is not acceptable in a particular matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING MANY FEELINGS<br />
INDICATING THAT WE LIVE IN OURSELVES</h2>
<p>When we feel that we have genuinely consecrated ourselves or paid a price, our feelings may not be accurate. Similarly, when we feel that there is a problem with our consecration or that we have not paid a price, these feelings may not be accurate either. Our feelings do not necessarily correspond with our condition. When we feel that we are paying a great price, it may not be so. The same applies to when we feel that we have not paid a price. We may consider ourselves to be humble, but actually we may be very proud. We may consider ourselves to be proud, but actually we may be very humble. Many times our condition is the opposite of our feelings and considerations.</p>
<p>Sometimes a believer feels that his spiritual condition is good, but his condition before the Lord is not so good. Sometimes he may feel that he cannot touch the Lord or that he does not love the Lord, but this may be the time when his relationship with the Lord is the sweetest. Our considerations are not reliable, and our spiritual condition is not according to our consideration.</p>
<p>Experiencing spiritual ups and downs shows that we are in the self. When we feel that we are doing well in reading the Bible, we are in the self. When we are not in the self, we often have no sense concerning our reading of the Bible, and when we are not in the self, we often have no feeling concerning our humility.</p>
<p>When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he did not know that his face was shining. It was the other Israelites who saw that his face was shining (Exo. 34:29-30). Hence, we must realize that the feelings we have related to our consecration, our paying a price, our touching a certain spiritual reality, our knowing the church, our receiving of spiritual light, our understanding of the Bible, and our touching of the Lord in prayer all come from the self. After a period of time, these feelings change. This proves that these feelings come from the self. Whether our feelings are positive or negative, they are from the self. When we are not in the self, we have no feeling concerning reading the Bible or learning a spiritual lesson. On the one hand, not having a feeling about a particular matter or thing is often an indication that we are not in the self. On the other hand, certain feelings or analysis related to our spiritual condition is often an indication that we are in the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSON OF BEING BROKEN<br />
IN OUR RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>In His wisdom God put us in communities and groups; otherwise, every person would think that he is the best person in the world. Every person thinks that he is the only person in the universe. Without a community, our pride would not be exposed, there would not be anxiety in our environment, and we would not be provoked to lose our temper. If we did not live in a community, what is in us would not be exposed.</p>
<p>God is wise in what He does. Before we were saved, He placed us in communities. After we are saved, He keeps us in communities and uses various human relationships to expose our inner condition. For example, a sister may feel that she is perfect, but after she has three children, she might feel that she is not doing so well. She may wonder why the Lord did not place her in an environment where she can use her gift to stir others up to love Him. The Lord will never allow us to escape from human relationships. God intentionally put us in relationships so that through them our condition would be manifested, and we would learn the lessons of being broken.</p>
<p>No one can learn the lessons of being broken apart from having relationships with others. How can a saint who does not have relatives, lives alone, and does not have a service with other saints learn the lessons of being broken? If we do not learn to be broken in our relationships, our true condition will not be manifested.</p>
<p>The lessons of being broken are learned when we are with others. Whenever we encounter a new human relationship, there is the need for us to be broken further. The addition of another human relationship in our lives will increase the demand for us to be broken. When a person is not married, there is not much of a requirement for him to be broken. Once he is married, there is the need to be broken. After he has his first child, there is the need for further breaking. The more children he has, the more breaking he will experience. If a young brother does not live with other brothers, he will not experience much of a demand to be broken. If he lives with other brothers, he will experience some breaking. A brother who does not bear responsibility will have fewer experiences of being broken. Once he becomes a responsible brother, he will have more experiences of being broken. The more human relationships we have, the more demands there are for us to be broken. Single brothers who love the Lord, fellowship with Him, read the Bible, and pray regularly but are not elders or deacons and do not coordinate with other saints will not be broken.</p>
<p>However, the Lord is wise in His arrangement. He has arranged many human relationships for us from which we cannot escape. If you are not married and do not have relatives, He will give you other members in the Body so that you can serve and bear responsibility together with them. Through such human relationships, we experience being broken, and our spiritual condition is exposed.</p>
