   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Spirit was not yet at the time of John 7:39 because He had not yet been consummated by the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before the resurrection of Christ, that is, before Christ's glorification, the Spirit was not yet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit of God in the Old Testament was the Spirit with merely the divine element, but in resurrection He was compounded with the humanity of Christ, with His all-inclusive death and its effectiveness, and with His resurrection and its power, which repels all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is now rich with all of these elements.</S>
