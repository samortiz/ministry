   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RESTRICTED TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regarding the worship of God, worship is absolutely a matter of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is Spirit, and we who worship Him must worship Him in spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We worship God the Spirit by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians understand this, but in their practice they have little realization that they are worshipping God exclusively by their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Your spirit is different from your mind, emotion, or any other part of your inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We all need to restrict ourselves to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we contact God or fellowship with Him, we must be restricted to our spirit, remembering that we have been born of the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must worship the Spirit only by means of our reborn spirit, not by any other part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some may ask what the difference is between worshipping God in spirit and worshipping Him by some other means.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although it is difficult to analyze this doctrinally, I can point out the difference in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Suppose after coming into the meeting you scrutinize the old ones and then the young ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you do this, you are surely not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then suppose you say to yourself, "Tonight, Brother Lee will speak.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What will he talk about?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has spoken so much about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Does he still have something more to say about the Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All these thoughts are like bugs that fly into your mind and occupy it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are occupied in this way, you are definitely not in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What then does it mean to be in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It means that you realize that you have been born of the Spirit in your spirit and that you come to the meeting to contact God the Spirit in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You forget your thinking and restrict yourself to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may praise the Lord and say, "Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Oh, the seven Spirits, the seven lamps, and the seven eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oh, the seven eyes on the stone and the seven eyes of the Lamb!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, when a brother stands up to speak, you may even forget his name.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You will simply be enjoying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some believers are very active in their thinking, feeling, and analyzing, but they do not exercise their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When you come to the meeting, you must forget yourself and exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever I am about to speak, I try my best to forget the heavens, the earth, and even my family.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But sometimes the enemy sends thoughts about my wife, children, and grandchildren to distract me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these thoughts are like bugs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, I care only for my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I speak, I determine to speak from my spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the secret of impact in speaking and the secret of the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to restrict ourselves to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God, and 1 Corinthians 6:17 says that he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is this a doctrine or a fact?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What about your experience?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In experience are you one spirit with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This must not merely be true doctrinally or positionally, but experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah, I am one spirit with the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a tremendous matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is not self-improvement or any type of behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not a matter of doing better, of loving, and of being holy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you dare say that right now you are one spirit with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am bold to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever I speak for Him, with Him, and in Him, I have the assurance that I am one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have the assurance that while I am speaking He is working, because I am one spirit with Him and know that He is one spirit with me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is not religion or ethics, philosophy or logic.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The believers in Christ can be one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Here we have power, life, light, and everything we need.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As long as we are one spirit with the Lord, all the pests are exterminated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The best pest control is to say, "O Lord Jesus, I am one spirit with You."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we say this, we have not only power, but also authority.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we are one spirit with the Lord, who can touch us?</S>
