   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Nee was absolutely right in saying that God does not care whether we are successful or whether we are mistaken.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God cares only for one thing for being worked into us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God does not have any intention to make someone a great professor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are flocks of scholars and professors on earth already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's intention is not to build up a world full of professors.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's intention is to build up His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All who are in His kingdom must be those who give God the full ground and the full opportunity to work Himself into them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why Paul said in Romans 8:28 that all things work together for good to those who love God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What is the "good" about which Paul is speaking here?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is this "good" a high degree or a promotion?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we love God, He will cause all things to work together for our good, but the good is not what we may want or expect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The good is what God intends to work out according to Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The good is for us to be conformed to the image of His firstborn Son v. 29 . God's heart's desire is not related to whether we get a good job or get promoted.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is not concerned about whether we make a lot of money or lose money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In fact, God may use all things to cause a person to lose money.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If this person made money, God would have no chance to work Himself into that person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a person loses money, he may complain to God, but God is taking this opportunity to dispense Himself into this person.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of us think we know how to pray, but actually we do not know how to pray in a fitting way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul indicated that the best prayer is to groan Rom 8:26, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not know how to pray, but the Spirit teaches us how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit teaches us to groan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This sister wondered why she lost all her money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She trusted in the Lord so much, but the Lord did not lead her to the right person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then she did not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we do not know how to pray, we groan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That is the best way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have seen that in many of the psalms, David was clear about how to pray, and he even instructed God to fight against his enemies with weapons Psa 35:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, this kind of prayer is not according to God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We surely should not instruct God in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Especially, we should not tell Him to deal with our enemies, because this is against the teaching of the New Testament Matt 5:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have seen in our life-study of the Psalms that the title of Psalm 34 says that David wrote this psalm after he had disguised himself in hypocrisy before Abimelech see message sixteen of Life-study of the Psalms .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>David disguised himself to make Abimelech think that he was insane, and then he blessed and praised God for delivering him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, he delivered himself by disguising himself, and then he gave God the credit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Instead, David should have said, "Lord, what shall I pray?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If David had prayed in this way, he would have been spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But David was so bold to bless and praise Jehovah for hearing him and delivering him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, David practiced falsehood to cheat that king.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Was that God's answering him?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I am saying this to help us realize that when we are so clear about how to pray, this means we are natural and in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The best prayer many times is to say, "Lord, I don't know how or what to pray."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not know the kind of prayer God desires, and we are not clear how to pray; hence we groan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In our groaning, the Spirit groans also, interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God the Father answers when the Spirit intercedes for us, and He arranges our circumstances, causing all things to work together for good to us.</S>
