Our hearts rejoice and our spirits leap. We treasure You deep within, and we are willing to follow You. Through Your rich mercy and sovereign grace, You have gathered us here for this New Year&#8217;s conference. We are so happy we can meet each other and gather together in Your name. Lord, we look to You to grace us and guide us again, through Your all-pervading and life-giving Spirit. We want to be fully open to You to receive more of You, to take in Your riches, and to enjoy Your fullness. O Lord Jesus, we need You once again to forgive us, cleanse us, and anoint us in a rich way. Operate within us and nourish us abundantly. May we be cared for, healed, comforted, and uplifted. Lord, we would all enjoy grace from You. May You speak a word or two to every one of us that would meet our present need.<p>Lord, what we can do is limited. But when we offer up ourselves to You, what is offered becomes unlimited. Lord, You can feed five thousand with five loaves and two fishes. We believe whatever little we have and can do comes from You. We want to offer it up to You again. Receive it into Your hands, break it, and give it to us, so that it can become our riches, and so that we can be satisfied with an overabundance. O Lord Jesus, we worship You. We believe that You are here now. We are here, and You are here. Actually, You came here first; we came after You were here. Lord, how glorious it is that we are called into Your precious name. We are not in ourselves, but in Your name. We are not in the worldly enjoyment, but in Yourself. Hallelujah! You are the Triune God. You have been processed and have reached an ultimate attainment. Now You are here available for us to enjoy. Release Your word once more. We are happy to hear Your word. Shine out Your light from the word again and manifest Yourself. Touch the deepest part of our being. May every one of us gain something. May honor, glory, and eternal riches be unto You. Amen.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>God's Way in Life &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
