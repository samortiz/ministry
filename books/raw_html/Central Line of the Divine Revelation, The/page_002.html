THE ENTIRE SCRIPTURE<br>BEING THE REVELATION OF GOD<br>AS THE UNIQUE DEITY, MAINLY IN<br>HIS DIVINE TITLES AND DIVINE PERSON</H2><P>The central line of the divine revelation begins with God. What the Bible reveals firstly and lastly is God. Nearly every page of the Bible reveals God. God is the main factor in the divine revelation. The Bible shows us the titles of God and the person of God. Then it goes on to show us His economy and His dispensing. These four things are the alpha of the divine revelation&#151;God's titles, God's person, God's economy, and the way to accomplish His economy, which is to dispense Himself into His chosen people. Later, we will see how God carried out His creation in the view of dispensing Himself into His chosen people. The main things that followed God's creation and man's fall were the age of promise and the age of types. There were many promises and many types as prefigures of the things to come. In all the types we can see God's dispensing, and in the promises it is the same.</P><P>In the New Testament, the first major item is incarnation. We want to study the incarnation this time in a very renewed way. Then we will go on to see Christ's humanity, including His human living, His all-inclusive death, His resurrection, and His ascension with His heavenly ministry. In His ascension and by His resurrection, He ministers, by the divine dispensing, in the heavenlies to produce the church, to build up the church, and to consummate the church age. Then we will fellowship about His appearing. He will appear as a stone from the heavens to fall upon the human government, to smash it, and to crush it (Dan. 2:34-35, 44-45). This will bring in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the millennium, which will eventually consummate in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem. The negative things and persons in the universe are cleared up through Christ's death and His last appearing.</P><P>Still, however, the rebellious element remains within man during the millennium. Thus, at the end of the millennium, there is the last rebellion of mankind instigated by Satan (Rev. 20:7-10). This will be a final sifting of man's rebellious nature, which will be fully purged away by the Lord's final judgment on mankind. During the millennium, the heavens and the earth remain old. God uses four ages to purge the oldness out of His creation&#151;the age before the law, the age of the law, the age of grace, and the age of the kingdom. Through these four ages, everything is brought into His divine newness. The kingdom age, the age of the millennium, will be the age of restoration, but not the age of complete newness.</P>
