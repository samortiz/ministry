[1]  CONTENTS Expressing God and Living in the Spirit The Lord Being the Spirit in Our Spirit God and Man Living Together and Living in the Spirit The Bringing Forth of the New Man and Living in the Spirit Guarding Ourselves from Idols and Living in the Spirit
[2]  Ephesians 4 shows us that the new man, which is the church, was created according to God v. 24 . The old man was created according to the image of God, so the new man was also created according to the image of God Col 3:10 . The ultimate manifestation of the new man in Ephesians 4 is the city, New Jerusalem, at the end of Revelation.
[3]  Therefore, in the beginning of the Bible man is the expression of God, in the middle of the Bible man is the expression of God, and also at the end of the Bible man is the expression of God.
[4]  GOD'S UNIQUE INTENTION BEING FOR MAN TO EXPRESS HIM
[5]  The Scriptures consistently show us that the main thought in the Bible is that God wants man to express Him.
[6]  Perhaps you may say that the Bible shows us that God wants us to worship Him, to serve Him, and to work for Him.
[7]  We must see that the consistent purpose, the central purpose, of God is not for us to worship Him, serve Him, or work for Him but for us to express Him.
[8]  Degraded Christianity has deviated from the lofty goal and eternal purpose of God to being concerned merely with worshipping God, serving God, and working for God.
[9]  In order to express God we must exercise our spirit.
[10]  Romans 8 tells us to walk according to the spirit, to live in the spirit v. 4 . If we do not live in the spirit, although we may practice to pray more, we will still be practicing a kind of self-mortification or asceticism, which we can do for only so long.
[11]  CHAPTER TWO THE LORD BEING THE SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Isa 9:6; 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:15; Gal 4:6; Rom 8:10; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:4; Gal 5:16, 25 THE TRIUNE GOD THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT
[12]  This is why there has not been much result even though we have released many things that God has shown us.
[13]  Suppose we told people that we were once fallen, but that God, who loved the world, came to be our Savior, and as our Savior died on the cross and shed His precious blood for the redemption of our sins.
[14]  In Isaiah 9:6 there are two lines one line is the line of the child, and the other is the line of the son.
[15]  A child was born to us, and His name was called Mighty God, and a son was given to us, and His name was called Eternal Father.
[16]  We must look to the Lord that He would enable us to see clearly that today our God, our Redeemer, is the Spirit.
[17]  In His essence He is Spirit, in His economy He is ultimately the Spirit, and in His resurrection He actually became the Spirit.
[18]  Romans 8 says that Christ is in us, and that as a result, our spirit is life v. 10 . Today Christ as the Spirit is in our spirit, so our spirit, which contains Him as life, is life.
[19]  He is not only with us in our spirit but is also mingled with our spirit as one spirit.
[20]  We need to see that the Triune God, the almighty God, who is Jehovah the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, has become our all and has been wrought into us.
[21]  The key to everything is found in this wonderful Spirit who is in our created and regenerated spirit and who has become one spirit with our spirit.
[22]  If we do not turn to our spirit and pray out of our spirit, our prayers will be improper.
[23]  We need to see that the great God Jehovah, the One who is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and who is also the Lord Jesus, the Redeemer, the Creator, and the Holy Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit who dwells in our spirit and is being mingled with our spirit as one spirit.
[24]  The only thing we need to know is that the God and Savior whom we love is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit who is dwelling in our spirit and has become one spirit with our spirit.
[25]  Although this book is familiar to us, most Christians, including many of us, do not realize what the spirit, the reality, or the essence of the Gospel of John is.
[26]  Others have seen that since we love one another, we should wash one another's feet v. 14 . Still others have seen even more, realizing that the Lord is the vine, that we are the branches, and that we abide in Him and He in us 15:1, 4-5 . However, most of them do not understand how we can abide in Him and how He can abide in us.
[27]  Rather, the highest gospel is that we would be saved to the extent that God and we, we and God, are completely mingled as one, having one life and one living.
[28]  We may have been Christians for decades, yet we may have never had the deep realization that the gospel of God saves us into Him to live with Him so that He and we can have one life and one living.
[29]  GOD ENTERING INTO MAN TO HAVE ONE LIFE AND ONE LIVING WITH MAN
[30]  In John 15 the Lord said, "Abide in Me and I in you" v. 4 . How can we abide in Him, and how can He abide in us? This is altogether a matter of the spirit.
[31]  Because He is the Spirit, we can abide in Him, and He can also abide in us.
[32]  The highest teaching in the Scriptures is to live in the spirit.
[33]  NEEDING TO EXERCISE AND PRACTICE LIVING WITH THE LORD
[34]  When we use our spirit to receive Him, He immediately comes into our spirit to regenerate us.
[35]  LIVING IN THE SPIRIT BEING THE MOST SIMPLE, CONVENIENT, AND EXCELLENT WAY
[36]  Some of the saints have said to me, "Brother Lee, over twenty years ago when you were training us here in Taipei, you spoke something different."
[37]  CHAPTER FOUR THE BRINGING FORTH OF THE NEW MAN AND LIVING IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Eph 2:15; 3:8, 16-17a, 19b; 4:23-24; 2 Cor 3:18 KEEPING UP-TO-DATE WITH THE FLOW OF THE AGE
[38]  NEEDING TO SEE AND ENJOY THE UNSEARCHABLE RICHES OF CHRIST
[39]  After this, Ephesians 3 tells us that Paul was sent to announce to us the unsearchable riches of Christ v. 8 . The unsearchable riches of Christ are contained in His eternal life, a life that has passed through death and resurrection.
[40]  Today we have not only the bright virtue, the innate knowledge and ability; we have the all-inclusive Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit, and the Triune God in our spirit as the unsearchable riches in us.
[41]  CARING ONLY FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT AND NOT HAVING REGULATIONS IN THE MEETINGS
[42]  If we would all live in this vision, there would be no regulations in our meetings.
[43]  CHAPTER FIVE GUARDING OURSELVES FROM IDOLS AND LIVING IN THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:24, 27-28; 4:13; 5:4, 18-21; Heb 4:12; 6:18-20 ABIDING IN THE LORD UNTIL HE COMES
[44]  The Triune God became the life-giving Spirit to abide in our spirit and to become one with us 1 Cor 15:45; 6:17 .
[45]  Now He wants us to live by Him, having one life and one living with Him.
[46]  What we need is to look to the Lord that He may continue to grant us mercy and grace so that we would live according to what we have seen.
[47]  The more we say, "I do not believe in Him, I do not want Him, I do not care about Him, and I do not care for Him," the tighter He will hold us within.
[48]  THE LORD DESIRING ONLY THAT WE LIVE BY HIM
[49]  The Lord's desire is not that we would be zealous and that we would do this or that for Him.
[50]  Rather, His desire is that we would be one with Him and live by Him.
[51]  Then our worship becomes something religious, something done to God without God in it, and our service becomes religious, something that is a service to the Lord but lacks the Lord in it.
[52]  THE WHOLE WORLD EXCEPT OUR SPIRIT LYING IN THE EVIL ONE
[53]  The synagogue not only became something religious but even became the synagogue of Satan, because although that was where the Jews worshipped God, studied the Scriptures, and served God, God was not there.
[54]  If we would read the last section of 1 John chapter five again, we would understand its real significance.
[55]  Verse 18 says, "We know that everyone who is begotten of God does not sin, but he who has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil one does not touch him."
[56]  This means that anything that is not of the true God, not of the eternal life, and not in the regenerated spirit is an idol.
[57]  Our reading of the Bible may be an idol, our prayer may be an idol, and even our bread-breaking may be an idol, because we may be reading the Word, praying, worshipping, serving, and even breaking bread outside of our regenerated spirit!
[58]  Hebrews 4 says that the word of God is living and able to pierce through us, dividing our spirit, as the Holy of Holies, from the soul that surrounds it v. 12 . Hebrews 6 says that we are all fleeing v. 18 . From what are we fleeing? We are fleeing from our idols, our flesh, our ideas, our views, our dissenting thoughts, and our old experiences.
