   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONFORMED TO THE MOLD OF CHRIST'S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus had a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nevertheless, in answering God's ordination, He did not live by His human life, but by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead of keeping the law, He lived by God, not caring for requirements, regulations, or commandments, but only for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus did not live merely according to His Father's commandments; He lived according to the Father Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Living such a life requires us to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the model, the mold, of Christ's death to which we are being conformed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we see this, we shall realize how far off the mark most of today's Christians are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Most of them are still in the Old Testament economy, under God's former ordination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But in the New Testament we should not be under that old ordination, but under the new ordination, the ordination of living not by ourselves, but by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as we live by Christ, whatever we do and wherever we go is all right, because it is actually not we who are doing a certain thing or going to a particular place, but Christ who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the past many of us thought that to be a Christian was simply to do whatever God asked us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this is the Old Testament economy, not the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the New Testament economy God does not ask us to do certain things, but to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Acting according to God's commandments does not require us to die, for we are needed to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But living by God requires us to die, not to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In one sense, God needs us, and in another sense, He does not need us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He does not need us to do anything, but He does need us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God only needs us to go to the cross and die.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To learn this lesson do not go to a professor to be educated; go to John the Baptist to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus was no exception to this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When He came to John the Baptist, John at first declined to baptize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the Lord said, "Permit it now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness" Matt 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus had to be buried and raised up by God so that He might live no longer by Himself, but by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This was the highest righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For example, no wife is better than the one who lives by her husband, not by herself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is what God desires today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He does not want us to do anything; He only wants us to die to our own life and to live out His life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the righteousness which is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BURIAL AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Before His ministry began, the Lord Jesus passed through such a death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All the time He was on earth, He did not live by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, He always lived by the Father and said, "I can do nothing from Myself" John 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord had been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How could a buried one do anything?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suppose you are buried.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What would you be able to do?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are still able to do something, it indicates that you have not been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our status must be that of a terminated and buried person who can do nothing from himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus seemed to say, "I can do nothing from Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I came out to minister, I was baptized, buried, under the water.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now, as a buried person, how can I do anything?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah, where burial is, there is resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The burial is of the human life, and resurrection is of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because He was buried and resurrected, the Lord Jesus did not live by His human life, but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord Jesus did everything by the Father who lived within Him John 14:10 , living as One who had been buried.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the power of resurrection was always with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At the end of His ministry, the Lord Jesus physically died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the two sons of Zebedee came to Him seeking for a position, He said, "Ye know not what ye ask: can ye drink of the cup that I drink of? and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Mark 10:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When they said to Him, "We can," Jesus said, "Ye shall indeed drink of the cup that I drink of; and with the baptism that I am baptized withal shall ye be baptized" Mark 10:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the book of Acts we see that the apostles were in fact baptized in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They were all buried and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, in Acts Peter did not live by his human life, but by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He was under the death of Christ and was being conformed to it.</S>
