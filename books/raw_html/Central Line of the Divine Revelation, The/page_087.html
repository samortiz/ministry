<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. By Living and Walking by the Spirit</H2><P>The sixth way to receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is by living and walking by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25). Living and walking by the Spirit is equivalent to having our being by the Spirit. The Spirit is in our human spirit (Rom. 8:16). It is often difficult in Paul's writings for translators to determine whether spirit should be capitalized or not. The spirit in Paul's writings is the mingled spirit, the Spirit who is in our spirit.</P><P>After rising up in the morning, we should do everything by our spirit. We must begin our day by living and walking in our spirit. If we rise up in a loose way, we will spoil the whole day. The best thing to do after rising up is to call on the name of the Lord. When we call "O Lord Jesus," we are in the spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). Calling in this way brings us back from everything to our spirit. Then we will have a good beginning of the day, and we will be able to face any situation. We will be able to encounter every circumstance by our spirit. This is to live and to walk by the Spirit. This experience follows the experience of being identified with Christ in His death in order that He may live in us. Without experiencing the identification with Christ, we cannot live and walk by the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. By Having Christ Formed in Us through Travail</H2><P>The way to receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the Spirit is also by having Christ formed in us through travail. Galatians 4:19 says, "My children, with whom I travail again in birth until Christ is formed in you." In Galatians 1:16 Christ is revealed in us; in 2:20 Christ lives in us; and in 3:27 Christ is upon us, clothing us like a garment. Now, in 4:19 Christ is formed in us.</P><P>The second stanza of Hymns, #499 says,</P><P CLASS=HBODY>Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a rest!<br>Christ now is being formed in me.<br>His very nature and life divine<br>In my whole being inwrought shall be.<br>All that I am came to an end,<br>And all of Christ is all to me.</P><P>The last two lines in the Chinese say that all that we are has been terminated, and Christ's all in all has become our element. Now His element is everything to us. This is the meaning of Christ's being formed in us. In his writings Paul also used the words transformed (2 Cor. 3:18) and conformed (Rom. 8:29). If we are not transformed, Christ has not been formed in us. Christ's being formed in us depends on our being transformed. We are transformed to His image, and He is formed in us. Our being transformed and His being formed cause us to be conformed to His image. Our being conformed to His image is His being formed in us further.</P>
