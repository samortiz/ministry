REFUTING JOB</H2><P>After correcting and rebuking Job, Elihu refuted him (vv. 14-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Saying That God<br>Speaks to Men and Instructs Them<br>That He May Turn Them Aside<br>to Be Kept from the Pit and from Perishing</H2><P>As Elihu refuted Job, he taught him, saying that God speaks to men and instructs them that He may turn them aside to be kept from the pit and from perishing (vv. 14-18). Elihu claimed that God speaks to men in two ways&#151;in a dream, a night vision, and by opening the ears of men and sealing up their instruction. Do you believe that God contacts people only in these two ways? Elihu was actually setting up a rule for God to follow. This is something that no one should do.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Saying That God Takes Care of a Man<br>Chastened with Sickness, Being Gracious to Him</H2><P>Next, Elihu said that God also takes care of a man chastened with sickness, being gracious to him, delivering him from perishing in the pit, and returning him to the days of his youth so that he will be justified and accepted by God and seek God's face with joyous shouting, and his life will see the light. According to Elihu, God accomplishes all these things for a man twice, even three times (vv. 19-30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. CHARGING JOB TO HEAR HIM AND BE SILENT,<br>SO THAT HE MIGHT TEACH HIM WISDOM</H2><P>In verses 31 through 33 Elihu charged Job to hear him and be silent, so that he might teach him wisdom. What kind of wisdom could Elihu teach Job? No wisdom was expressed in Elihu's speaking.</P><P>Thus far, Elihu had not answered Job with a clear view&#151;in spite of the full assurance he had that he could answer Job adequately concerning the purpose of God in dealing with Job&#151;like the apostle Paul's clear vision in the New Testament concerning the goal of gaining Christ in his suffering of the loss of all things (Phil. 3:8-14). Elihu's word had nothing of the divine wisdom. With Paul, however, there was a clear word of revelation. Hence, Paul's word was truly the word of wisdom.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_080.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_082.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Job &nbsp; pg 81</div><br></body></html>
