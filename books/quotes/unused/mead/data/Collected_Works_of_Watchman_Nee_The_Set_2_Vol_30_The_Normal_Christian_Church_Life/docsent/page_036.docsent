   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The sphere of the church is local, and the local church should on no account be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The question naturally arises, if the spiritual life of a local not denominational church is very low, can a few of the more spiritual members not gather together and form another assembly?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The answer from the Word of God is emphatically, No!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's Word only warrants the establishment of churches on local ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even lack of spirituality is no adequate reason for dividing the church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Should local methods, government, and organization be far from ideal, that still constitutes no reason for division.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even wrong teaching 2 John 9 excepted is no ground for those who know better to form a separate church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must lay it to heart that the difference of locality is the only ground for dividing the Church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No other ground is scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We who live in the same locality cannot but belong to the same church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is something from which there is no escape.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If I am dissatisfied with the local church, the only thing I can do is to change my locality; then automatically I change my church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can leave a denomination, but we can never leave a church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To leave a sect is justifiable, but to leave a church whether on account of unspirituality, wrong doctrine, or bad organization is utterly unjustifiable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you leave the local church and form a separate assembly, you may have greater spirituality, purer teaching, and better government; but you have no church; you have only a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the second and third chapters of Revelation we see seven different churches in seven different localities.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only two were not rebuked but actually praised by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The other five were all definitely censured.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Spiritually those five were in a sad state.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They were weak, defeated churches; but they were churches for all that, not sects.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Spiritually they were wrong, but positionally they were right; therefore, God only commanded those in them to be overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord said not a word about leaving the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A local church is a church which you cannot leave; you must remain in it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are more spiritual than the other members, then you should use your spiritual influence and your authority in prayer to revive that church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the church does not respond, you have only two alternatives; you must either remain there, keeping yourself undefiled, or else you must change your dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But this does not apply to a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is futile to seek by a wrong application of these two chapters to keep Spirit-taught believers within a sect, for the seven churches referred to are local churches, not sectarian "churches."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However weak they may have been, they were still on the scriptural ground of the Body in the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Word of God has never authorized anyone to leave a church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All groups of believers who base their fellowship on other ground than that of locality are sects, even though they may term themselves churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is all right to leave a sect, but it is never right to leave a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you leave a local church, you do so without the authority of the Lord, and you become guilty of the sin of schism in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a tragedy it is when a few spiritual members leave a local church, and form another assembly, simply because the other members are weak and immature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those stronger members should remain in that church as overcomers, seeking to help their weaker brothers and sisters, and claiming the situation there for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, how prone we are to despise the believers we consider inferior to us, and how we delight to associate with those whose fellowship we find specially congenial.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Pride of heart, and a selfish enjoyment in spiritual things, causes us to overlook the fact that a church in any given place should consist of all the children of God in that place; so we narrow down Christian fellowship and make selection among the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is sectarianism, and it is a grief of heart to the Lord.</S>
