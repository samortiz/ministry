<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Father</H2><P>Another divine title used in the New Testament is Father. Father, in Greek Pater, denotes that God as the Father is the origin, the source, of all the families of God's creatures (Eph. 3:15). In God's creation there are many families, such as the family of the angels, the family of mankind, and the family of the animals. The source, the Father, of these families is God.</P><P>Eventually, there is a particular family, the highest family, which is the household of the faith (Gal. 6:10). God is the Father, especially of the household of the faith, which is begotten of Him. We believers are a particular family. Actually, we are the genuine family because we were not only created by God as the Creator, the origin, the source, but also regenerated, begotten by God. God has imparted His life essence into our being.</P><P>God is the Father of the human race. Luke 3:38 says that Adam was the son of God, but that does not mean that Adam was begotten of God. Adam was only created by God. God was not his Father in life but his Father in creation as the origin. In the new creation, however, we have a Father in life who regenerated us, who imparted His very life essence into us. We are His genuine family, the family of faith, the household of faith.</P><P>The Father is also called Abba (Aramaic) Father (Greek). In the Gospels, the Lord Jesus addressed God as Abba, Father (Mark 14:36). The apostle Paul also told us we cry Abba, Father in the spirit of sonship (Rom. 8:15; Gal. 4:6). Abba, Father is an intensified expression of intimacy. When we say Father, this is sweet. When we say Abba, this is sweeter. But when we say Abba, Father, this is the sweetest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Lord</H2><P>Lord, in Greek Kurios, denotes Jesus Christ as the Lord of all, who possesses all (John 20:28; Acts 2:36; 10:36). It is often used as a substitute for the title Jehovah in the Old Testament, as in Mark 1:3. Mark 1:3 quotes the word of the Old Testament in Isaiah 40:3. In the word of the Old Testament, it was Jehovah. In the quotation in the New Testament, it becomes the Lord. This indicates that the Lord in the New Testament is a substitute for Jehovah. Another Greek word, Despotes, is used to denote either God or the Lord Jesus as the Master of the slaves (Luke 2:29; Acts 4:24; Rev. 6:10; Jude 4; 2 Pet. 2:1; cf. 1 Tim. 6:1-2). In the Old Testament the Master of the slaves is called Adonai, but in the New Testament, in the Greek, He is called Despotes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Jesus</H2><P>Jesus, meaning Jehovah the Savior or Jehovah the salvation (Matt. 1:21), denotes that Jesus is Jehovah God becoming our Savior or Jehovah God becoming our salvation. This means that Jesus is the complete God becoming a perfect man (Matt. 1:23), thus, a God-man (1 Tim. 2:5). Jesus is a God-man. He is the very God and the perfect man.</P>
