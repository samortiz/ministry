   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MUTUAL DWELLING AN ETERNAL PRINCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must remember that our God in His Trinity, with all His plan, economy, and achievements, has been wrought into this city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That means our God in His Trinity with everything He has done and achieved has been wrought into our intrinsic being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, He and we are blended, mingled together, as a mutual dwelling to Him and to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He will dwell in us as His habitation, the eternal tabernacle, for eternity, and we will dwell in Him as our dwelling, the eternal temple, for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There should be no consideration in our being that the New Jerusalem is a physical dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even today in the church age we care for the church as our home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To God the church is His house and to us it is our home.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not interpret the church in a physical sense, but in the sense of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This home, the church, is in the same principle as the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This home is the Triune God with all His achievements wrought into the believers humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This home, the church, is a mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This principle is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It will exist and be applied to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church today is a house of the Triune God wrought into His redeemed ones as their home.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The New Jerusalem will continue this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The only difference is that today we are in the process and in that day of the New Jerusalem it will be the consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The process to reach the consummation and the consummation itself are exactly the same in principle and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Actually, the process is a precursor of the consummation and the consummation is a fulfillment of the precursor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These two are one item.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, we should praise the Lord that today we are already in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church life is a miniature of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE MOTHER OF THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Galatians 4:24-26 is another portion from the Word which we must consider concerning the New Jerusalem: These things are spoken allegorically; for these women are two covenants, one from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children unto slavery, which is Hagar.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now this Hagar is Sinai the mountain in Arabia and corresponds to the Jerusalem which now is, for she is in slavery with her children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Jerusalem above is free, which is our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The physical Jerusalem represents the law which produces children unto slavery, but the Jerusalem which is above is free who is our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Revelation 21 the New Jerusalem is a wife, but here it is the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a wife to be our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the New Jerusalem is a physical thing, how could this city produce us as her children?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How could our begetting mother be a physical city built with real precious stones, gold, and pearls?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>None of these items are organic.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Neither gold, nor pearls, nor precious stones produce anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then how could they have children?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These verses again show us that we should not understand the New Jerusalem in a physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only the natural, uneducated mentality which possesses inadequate biblical knowledge understands in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our mind has ever been renewed, has ever been enlightened, and if we have been fully and adequately spiritually educated, we would never understand the New Jerusalem in such a wrong and superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The New Jerusalem, which is the Jerusalem above, the heavenly Jerusalem, is our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This motherly Jerusalem stands for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The physical Jerusalem stands for law, and this heavenly Jerusalem which is our mother stands for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this grace are the Triune God, His plan, His economy, His redemption, His salvation, and all His achievements wrought into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is grace in its totality and we all have been born of this grace, so this grace is our mother.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This surely could never be a physical city.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This must be the Triune God with His redemption and His salvation, including regeneration, transformation, and glorification, wrought into His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is our mother and this is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We do not belong to anything physical.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We belong to this divine yet human composition saturated, even constituted, with God s grace which produces us all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Jerusalem is our mother and we are her children.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hope this principle will help us in understanding this ultimate consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I also hope, trust, and expect much of you younger brothers for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You must study all the things I have given you.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these hints and principles need our entire life to study.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These principles are very basic and very fundamental.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the vision in the Lord s recovery, which is not the teaching of theology, but is fully based upon the New Testament ministry.</S>
