   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ACTS MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE THE PROPAGATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN ASIA MINOR AND EUROPE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF PAUL S COMPANY 27 Scripture Reading: Acts 22:1-21 PAUL S BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 22:1-21 Paul defends himself before the rioting Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we shall focus our attention on Ananias word to Paul in verse 16: And now, why do you delay?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rise up and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the case of Paul, like that of the Ethiopian eunuch, water baptism is emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to pay attention both to water baptism and Spirit baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Water baptism signifies the believers identification with Christ s death and resurrection Rom 6:3-5; Col 2:12 , and Spirit baptism signifies the reality of the believers union with Christ in life essentially and in power economically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Water baptism is the believers affirmation of the Spirit s reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both are needed, and neither can replace the other.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All believers in Christ should properly have both.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the Lord s word in Mark 16:16, in order to be saved, a person must believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To believe is to receive the Lord John 1:12 not only for forgiveness of sins Acts 10:43 , but also for regeneration 1 Pet 1:21, 23 , so that those who believe may become the children of God John 1:12-13 and the members of Christ Eph 5:30 in an organic union with the Triune God Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be baptized is to affirm this by being buried to terminate the old creation through Christ s death and by being raised up to be a new creation of God through Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Such a baptism is much more advanced than the baptism of repentance by John Mark 1:4; Acts 19:3-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To believe and to be baptized are two parts of one complete step for receiving the full salvation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be baptized without believing is merely an empty ritual; to believe without being baptized is to be saved only inwardly without an outward affirmation of the inward salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These two should go together.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>TRANSFERRED OUT OF ADAM INTO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Baptism is actually a great transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, the New Testament ministry began with baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have emphasized the fact that baptism involves first termination and then germination.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through termination and germination a real transfer takes place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not surprising, then, that the New Testament begins with baptism to indicate that the things of the Old Testament should be terminated in order to have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, among many Christians today, baptism is simply a ritual whereby people enter into another kind of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we were baptized, we were transferred out of Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many Christians have never been taught this adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Others know that in baptism they were transferred out of Adam into Christ, but for them this is only a doctrinal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not something practical in their Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In our living as Christians we should be out of Adam and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No longer should we live in the sphere of Adam; instead, our living should absolutely be in the sphere of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 22:16 Ananias told Paul to be baptized and wash away his sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse calling on His name modifies both be baptized and wash.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here Ananias seems to be saying, Paul, rise up and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As you are being baptized, you must call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Calling on His name is the condition of your being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It would be a good practice for us when baptizing new believers to charge them to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This means that while they are being baptized, they are calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Just as we breathe and eat at the same time, so a person may be baptized and call on the Lord at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The transfer that takes place through baptism is strengthened by one s calling on the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, let us charge those who are being baptized by us to call on the name of the Lord Jesus and thereby have a stronger transfer out of Adam into Christ.</S>
