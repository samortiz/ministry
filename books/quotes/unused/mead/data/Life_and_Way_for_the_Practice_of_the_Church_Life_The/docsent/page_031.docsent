   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE TRANSFORMATION BY THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2, 6, 16, 29; 12:1-2, 4-5; 2 Cor 3:17-18 OUR NEED TO SET OUR MIND ON THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to fellowship about our need to be transformed by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Within our spirit we have the wonderful all-inclusive Spirit, but without we have something awfully troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is our natural man, the man of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Outwardly, people may look nice, but actually no one is nice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everyone is troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have this wonderful One within us, but we still have the old man, the old nature, the flesh, and the soulish life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have two realms from which to choose: the realm of the spirit and the realm of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now the crucial thing is what we do with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our mind may be a mind of the flesh, or it may be a mind of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mind represents the man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether we stand with the spirit or with the flesh depends on the attitude of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The mind set on the flesh is death, and the mind set on the spirit is life and peace Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the attitude of our mind today?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is it set upon the spirit or the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the garden of Eden there were three items: the tree of life, the tree of knowledge, and a man standing before the two trees Gen 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you realize that within you today there are these three things?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First, you have the spirit, the divine Spirit mingled with your human spirit, with all the wonderful things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, you have the flesh with something of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, you have the mind representing yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Where does your mind stand?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If your mind is set on the flesh, that means you are standing with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If your mind is set on the spirit, that means you are standing with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the central point, the main thing, today is the attitude of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we realize why in Romans 12:2 the apostle said that we need to be transformed by the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Romans 8:2 there is the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then in Romans 8:6 there are two possibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may stand either with the flesh or with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we stand with the flesh, we are in death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we stand with the spirit, we are in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 8:29 says that we have "to be conformed to the image of His Son."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By the renewing of our mind we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Also, by being transformed we will realize that the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God is the Body life revealed in Romans 12.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 8 reveals that we have the law of the Spirit of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we stand with this law, we will be transformed and conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Romans 12 shows that by our being transformed, we realize the good will of God, which is to have the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, the church life is a life of transformation, a life in which Christ as the Spirit is transforming us all the time.</S>
