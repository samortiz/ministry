   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to be those who are going out to get sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is what it means to release God's chosen people.</S>

   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the sinners are Satan's captives.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the angels rejoice when just one sinner is saved, when one captive is released Luke 15:10, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first verse of hymn #1068 says:</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In tenderness He sought me,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Weary and sick with sin,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And on His shoulders brought me</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Into His flock again.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While angels in His presence sang</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Until the courts of heaven rang.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse tells us that when a sinner is saved, the angels' singing fills the courts of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The angels in heaven rejoice every time a sinner is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our gospel preaching is to release the captives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we build up the church, God's house and household, with the released sinners saved through our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also establish the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the sinners saved through our preaching will be members of the house of God and of the kingdom of God.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, they will consummate in the coming New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Day by day and week by week we should be working in this way for God's good pleasure to touch God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Each one of us needs to be today's Cyrus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Like Cyrus, we need to be birds of prey who go out to gain sinners for God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The saved sinners are our prey.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All of these saved ones are the released captives who have been made sons of God and members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How good it is!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a pleasant work should never tire us out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should only know how to make our God happy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's charge to us should be sweet and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we realize what we are doing for God's good pleasure, we will be happy.</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nebuchadnezzar captured them, and Cyrus wanted to send them back home.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This was his pleasure, and it was also the pleasure of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God in heaven could have applauded Cyrus as a good servant.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God could have said to Cyrus, "You are doing something according to My good pleasure in My heart.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I'm happy to see you release My people for them to build up the temple and erect the holy city again."</S>
