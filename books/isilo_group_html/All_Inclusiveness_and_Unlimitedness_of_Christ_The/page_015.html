We may say that this is the highest, deepest, and most mysterious truth in the Bible.

However, up to now, the believers&#8217; exposition and knowledge of the Bible have not reached the final point. Of course, as early as the second century, some great Bible expositors, who in church history are called the church fathers, had already interpreted a great deal concerning the Bible. From that time until now, in every age there have been many who have studied and learned the biblical truths. History shows us that this study or learning is not individual but corporate, involving all the believers, and it is also progressive, becoming clearer century by century. Of course, from A.D. 570, after the papal system had fully become established, the Bible was locked up for ten centuries. That period of time is referred to in history as the Dark Ages. For one thousand years, human society was in darkness because the Bible had been sealed.<p>Thereafter, Martin Luther and some of his contemporaries rose up to bring in the Reformation, and risking their lives, they opened the closed Bible. Moreover, printing was invented at that time, so the spreading of the Bible no longer depended on copying by hand but on printing. Thus the Bible was released from its imprisonment and could be distributed in large quantities. However, at that time the contents of the Bible were not very open, and people&#8217;s understanding of the Bible was very limited. Thus the Bible seemed to remain a sealed book.<p>From the Reformation in the time of Martin Luther, throughout the centuries one Bible expositor after another was raised up to unravel some of the biblical truths. However, the degree of the unraveling was very limited. This situation lasted for about four centuries, beginning from the time of Luther, through the time of Zinzendorf, and proceeding to the previous century, the nineteenth century. In the 1820s, the Lord raised up the Brethren in England. Once they were raised up, the light of the truths flooded like a waterfall. From that time onward, the Bible was formally opened to us. We thank and praise the Lord for this!<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The All-Inclusiveness and Unlimitedness of Christ &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
