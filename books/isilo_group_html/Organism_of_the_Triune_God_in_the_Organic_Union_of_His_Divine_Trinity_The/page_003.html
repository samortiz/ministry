<p>The Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God, and this organism is an issue of the divine Trinity. Genesis 2 shows that Eve was an issue of Adam. While Adam was sleeping, God took a rib out of his side, and with this rib He built a woman (v. 22). The rib that issued out of Adam&rsquo;s side eventually became Eve. Eve was an issue out of Adam. In like manner, the church as the organism of the Triune God is the issue of the divine Trinity. The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is an issue of the Father as the source of the divine Trinity, an issue of the Son as the course of the divine Trinity, and an issue of the Spirit as the consummation of the flow of the divine Trinity. We need to see these three aspects of this divine, wonderful, marvelous, excellent issue. This issue is of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. Our God is not that simple. The Bible tells us that God is triune. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, yet He is one unique God. Just as a river has a source, a course, and a flow, the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow of the divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">An Issue of the Father<br />
as the Source of the Divine Trinity</h2>
<h2 class="head3">In His Selection of the Saints</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God is an issue of the Father as the source of the divine Trinity in His selection of the saints that they may share His holy nature to be holy (Eph. 1:4). God the Father, in His Son, the Christ, has chosen us to be holy. For us to be holy requires that we share His holy nature. In the entire universe, the only holy One is God. No one is holy except God Himself. He chose some persons created by Him to be holy as He is. These chosen ones can be holy only by partaking of God. God desires to impart Himself as the very holy nature into us. When we partake of His holy nature, His holy nature will be mingled with our being, transforming us into His likeness, which is holy and without blemish. As God&rsquo;s chosen ones, we will be like gems without any blemishes, or foreign particles. To be holy is to share God&rsquo;s holy nature without any mixture. This implies an impartation, a dispensing, of God&rsquo;s holy nature into our being. The issue of this dispensing is that we are the same in likeness and in nature as the source, the Father.</p>
<h2 class="head3">In His Predestination of the Saints</h2>
<p>The organism of the Triune God, the Body of Christ, is also an issue of the Father in His predestination of the saints that they may share His life to be His sons (Eph. 1:5). For God to impart His life into us that we may share His life is His dispensing, and this dispensing is an issuing. Verses 4 and 5 of Ephesians 1 are a part of one long sentence: &ldquo;According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.&rdquo; To understand these verses, we must understand their grammatical construction. The subject of these verses is &ldquo;He&rdquo; and the predicate is &ldquo;chose.&rdquo; Verse 5 begins with &ldquo;predestinating.&rdquo; God the Father chose us, predestinating us. Verse 5 is a participial phrase which functions as an adverb that modifies the verb &ldquo;chose.&rdquo; How did He choose us? He chose us by predestinating us. In the past we mistakenly said that God first chose us, and then He predestinated us. If this were true verses 4 and 5 would say, &ldquo;He chose us...<em>and</em> predestinated us.&rdquo; If the grammatical construction were like this, then it would be clear that God did two things in Christ before the foundation of the world: first He chose us and then He predestinated us. But according to the actual grammatical construction, God chose us by the marvelous way of predestinating us, or marking us out. He predestinated us unto sonship. &ldquo;Unto&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;for.&rdquo; God predestinated us for sonship, for making us sons. He desired that we would be His sons by sharing His life. Years ago we coined a new English word&mdash;&ldquo;sonized.&rdquo; Sonship is sonization.</p>
<p>A son is made by the impartation of life which eventually results in a birth. God Himself begot us, regenerated us (John 1:12-13). Because we have been begotten of God, we have received His life and have become His sons. We also have His very holy nature, and this nature will make us holy. God chose us with the intent that we would be born of Him to share His life and to participate in His holy nature. By partaking of His nature, we can be transformed into His image to bear His likeness. Then we will be like God (1 John 3:2). This is the issue of the Father&rsquo;s dispensing, the issue of the Father&rsquo;s impartation of Himself with His life and with His nature into our being.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
