J. to I. N., reveal to us Christ&#8217;s kingdom ministry, beginning from the coming back of Christ to Christ&#8217;s judgment at the great white throne over all the dead.</li>	<li>In the kingdom ministry of Christ, the first thing that Christ will do is to judge His believers at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10):		<ol class="decimal">		<li>To reward His overcoming believers with His kingdom that they may enter into the millennial kingdom to partake of Him as the tree of life (Rev. 2:7) and to share His joy and His kingship-Matt. 25:21, 23; Rev. 20:4, 6.</li>		<li>To discipline His defeated believers with the punishment in the millennial kingdom that they may be put away from His glory and enjoyable presence to a place of darkness for their discipline (Matt. 25:30) that they may mature in His life for them to participate in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth after the kingdom age.</li>		<li>To marry His overcoming believers as His bride (Rev. 19:7-9).</li>		<li>To defeat Antichrist with his partner, the false prophet, and the nations who follow them in rebelling against God in the war at Armageddon (Rev. 19:11-16). His newly married bride, as His armies, will fight together with Him (19:14; 17:14). Christ and His bride-army will defeat Antichrist and his followers and cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire directly (19:19-21). In the meantime, Satan will be bound for a thousand years and cast into the abyss (20:1-3). Then the millennial kingdom of Christ will begin (vv. 4, 6).</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The second thing that Christ will do in His kingdom ministry is to judge, on the throne of His glory, the nations (the living-Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1) who remain at that time: some as goats will be condemned to perish eternally and some as sheep will be justified to enter into eternal life-Matt. 25:31-46.</li>	<li>At the end of the millennial kingdom, Satan will be released and will deceive the nations again to rebel against God; the nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan will be cast into the lake of fire-Rev. 20:7-10.<br>	Note: Through all the above judgments Christ will clear up all the opposers of God from this earth; this consummates His kingdom ministry.</li>	<li>After the millennium, Christ will be at His great white throne to judge all the dead throughout the generations and cast them into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:11-12, 15). Thus, Christ will clear up the entire universe, preparing the way for the new heaven and new earth to come.</li>	<li>The new heaven and new earth will come, in which the holy city, New Jerusalem, is manifested for God&#8217;s eternal enlargement and expression-Rev. 21:1-2.</li>	</ol></li></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Triune God's Revelation and His Move &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
