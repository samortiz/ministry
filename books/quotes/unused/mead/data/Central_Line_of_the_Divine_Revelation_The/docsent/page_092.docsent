   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Taking Christ as the Lamb of God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Who Takes Away the Sin of the World</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, we must take Him as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world 1:29, 36 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ's being the Lamb of God is one of the deep items in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lamb of God, no doubt, is Jesus, yet He is certainly not a lamb with four legs and a tail.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus was called the Lamb of God because in the eyes of God He was the sacrifice, the offering, for the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world here is a composition of the people of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The people who constitute the world are sinful, and the world as the composition of these people also is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Isaiah 53:7, Christ was led like a lamb to the slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the people who dealt with Him at the time of His crucifixion led Him like a lamb to the cross, the place of slaughter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the cross God collected all our sins and put the totality of sin upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, in the eyes of God, He became the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Through His death He took away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we believe into Christ as the Lamb of God, we gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is the basic way to take Christ and to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By Following Christ as Messiah</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's Anointed One</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To receive, experience, and enjoy Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit, we must follow Christ as Messiah John 1:37, 40-41, 43-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word Messiah in Hebrew is the equivalent of the word Christ in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ means "the anointed One," and the anointed One is also the appointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must follow the One who has been appointed and anointed by God to be the Executor of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to realize that the very Jesus whom we are following is the Messiah, God's elected One, His chosen One, the One anointed and appointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By Being Born Anew of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To receive, experience, and enjoy the all-inclusive Christ, we need to be born anew of the Spirit John 3:3, 5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This verse indicates that to be born again is altogether a matter of the two spirits, God the Spirit and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We were born again not in our physical body but in our spirit, not of blood or flesh but of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our human spirit was born of God's Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To be born again is a very subjective way for us to gain Christ for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The entire Gospel of John is on the enjoyment of Christ by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Without the Spirit we do not have the way to enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Receiving, experiencing, and enjoying Christ are absolutely related to our spirit and the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Before being born again, the Spirit and our spirit were separated and far apart.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But through regeneration, the two spirits have been brought together as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Through this one spirit we have the way to receive, enjoy, and experience Christ.</S>
