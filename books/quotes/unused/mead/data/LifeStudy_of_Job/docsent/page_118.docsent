   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In these messages we have been considering the significance of the book of Job according to the Bible as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the divine revelation in the holy Scriptures there are two trees, two sources, two lines, two principles, and two ends.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are the matters that we will cover in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Genesis 2 there are two trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in Revelation 21 and 22 we see only one tree the tree of life in a holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the center of this city is the throne of God and of the Lamb 22:1 , indicating God's administration.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God and the Lamb are not sitting side by side on the throne; rather, God is in the Lamb much like light is in a lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lamb is the lamp 21:23 , and God is the light in the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that God and the Lamb, the light and the lamp, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, that is, out of the one God, flows a river, and on the two sides of this river grows the tree of life 22:2a .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the principle, if the tree of life ends in the city of water, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil must end in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the evil things in Revelation 22 are involved with the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, the two ends are the city of water and the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Between the two sources and the two ends are two lines, which become two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Each source issues in a line that becomes a way consummating in an end.</S>
