<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In God's Salvation</H2><P>The divine dispensing is also in God's salvation (Rom. 5:10). God's redemption is the foundation of His salvation. Based on His redemption, God has to save us by the life of Christ. The first step of this saving is to regenerate us, which is to impart the divine life into us. Thus, God's salvation is centered in life-dispensing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Saving Sinners</H2><P>The divine dispensing is involved also in the saving of sinners (John 3:3, 5-6; Titus 3:5). When God saves sinners, He regenerates them, dispensing Himself as life into their being. When we go to seek sinners for Christ, we need to point out to them that they need God's life and that the way to receive God's life is to be born of God, to be regenerated.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. In Nourishing the New Believers</H2><P>God's ordained way is first to regenerate us and then to nourish us. First Peter 2:2 says that as newborn babes we need to drink of the milk of the word so that we may grow unto salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. In Perfecting the Saints</H2><P>Ephesians 4:12-13 speaks of perfecting the saints, something which is needed by all believers. To perfect the saints is to dispense Christ into them so that they can grow to maturity. When we preach the gospel, we impart Christ into sinners. When we nourish the new believers, we dispense Christ into them as food, as the nourishing element. Likewise, when we perfect the saints, we minister Christ to them, dispensing Christ into them not only as milk but also as solid food (1 Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:13-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. In Prophesying</H2><P>The divine dispensing is also in prophesying (1 Cor. 14:3). When we prophesy in our meetings, our prophesying must minister Christ. We should not merely speak concerning a part of the Bible or merely talk about doctrine; we should do our best to put Christ into our prophesying. Then the reality of our ministry will be Christ Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. In Building Up the Body of Christ</H2><P>All the foregoing items&#151;to save sinners, to nourish the new believers, to perfect the saints, and to prophesy&#151;are to build up the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:15-16).</P><P>We need to see that God's economy is to dispense Himself in Christ into us, beginning with regeneration and continuing with nourishing and perfecting until we become mature. Then we will be built into the Body of Christ.</P>
