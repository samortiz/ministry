   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTERS OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REPRESENTING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who minister the word represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This concerns our person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be persons who speak for God as His representatives.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Since we are God s representatives, we cannot speak our own words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should be persons who also contact God and fellowship with Him continually.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not give a message if we cannot touch God and fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we give a message, we should fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When our condition does not match what we speak, we are not speaking for God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we speak should minister God; otherwise, we are not speaking for God, and our words are vain and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MESSAGES NOT DEPENDING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>ON THE SUBJECT BEING SIMPLE OR DEEP,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>NEW OR OLD, BUT ON BEING LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The messages that we give should not depend on whether the subject is simple or deep.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A message that is deep may not necessarily be good.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may consider that we would speak on something that is deep, because others have spoken on regeneration already.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This concept needs to be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can give a simple message on regeneration even if others speak about abiding in the Lord or about regeneration in a deep way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It does not matter whether a message is simple or deep; neither does it matter whether it is new or old.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should have a willingness to speak on the same subject.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It may be that a brother spoke on regeneration last week, another brother may speak on regeneration this week, and still another brother may speak on regeneration next week.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We may speak on regeneration for several weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we speak on regeneration, the more the saints will be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not be afraid to repeat topics.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We do not have to always be looking for new topics.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we are always looking for some new topics, we will be speaking on many strange topics.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our only concern should be that a message is living, not whether it is simple, deep, new, or old.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We can speak the same message in many different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the brothers who minister the word in the church in Taipei give fifty living messages concerning regeneration, the church in Taipei will be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should speak messages that are living, not messages that are deep, new, or strange.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to speak a living message, we must not be at ease and rely on our mind too much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we want to speak a living message, our spirit must be fresh and living.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>NOT STRESSING LOGIC</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, instead of stressing logic, we should focus on whether the saints can touch God and life and whether the message is living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not many people focus on the logic of a message in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some saints are not even clear concerning the topic of a message, but they remember what touches them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we should not focus on presenting a message in a logical way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Scriptures were written by men who were borne by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While the Bible is not illogical, it is not rigidly logical.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nevertheless, the Bible has its logic.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>AVOIDING BIBLE EXPOSITION AND</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THINGS OF KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The brothers who minister the word should not quote from too many sources, because this does not help the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Quoting from many sources inevitably leads to messages that merely contain knowledge in a way of Bible exposition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should try to avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An exposition of the Bible should give life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If it does not give life, we should not use it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether we give a message in an edification meeting, in a Bible-study meeting, or for fellowship, we should try our best to avoid bringing in too many things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not think that it is useful to quote many sources.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we expound the Word, we should do so according to life to meet the need in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This can be likened to a fruit tree, which has branches, leaves, and fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The edible part of a tree is the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The function of the other parts of the tree is to produce the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There are many words recorded in the Bible, but some of them are branches and leaves that support the things which supply us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They are not the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We cannot eliminate these words, because without them the central words will not survive.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This can be compared to cutting off the leaves and branches from a tree but still expecting the tree to grow fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The words that are the branches and leaves support the fruit which supplies life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should not give the saints branches and leaves to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some brothers quote too many sources when they give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must check and be sure that what we quote gives life to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not give messages that stir up the saints curiosity; rather, we should supply life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The food prepared in a kitchen is to supply people with nutrients.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not give people branches to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not a matter of whether something is from the Bible but whether it supplies life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is useless to give the saints something that is in the Bible if it does not supply life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It may be difficult for us to receive this word.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, according to my observation, the brothers who minister the word quote too many sources when they give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This often causes the saints to only debate about the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Over the years saints have come to me with many questions concerning Bible exposition, but I never answered their questions.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I rarely answer questions after I give a message, because most questions lead to debates.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The brothers should learn to eat only the fruit, not the branches and leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to be delivered from debates.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Thus, in order to avoid debates, we should not bring distracting things to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The more distracting things that we bring in, the more debates there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should give only one kind of message, which is a word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should receive only the things that supply us with life from the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Expositions and word studies should be on our desk, not on the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>What we present from the podium must supply life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Some of the brothers may be offended by this word.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>As your brother, I must admonish you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we do not receive this fellowship, we will reap the fruit of our labor in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Whatever a person sows, this he will also reap Gal 6:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If we give the brothers and sisters life, we will enjoy the fruit of our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is a small thing for us to suffer, but it is a great matter for the church to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>May the Lord have mercy on us and cause us to take heed to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>May we know only that God in His Son through the Holy Spirit is our life, and may we speak only this word.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We do not want anything other than this word.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Just as fish bones are to support the fish and are not for us to eat, some words in the Bible support the words that give life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>These words were needed to write the Bible, but we do not eat these words, nor do we give them to the saints to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We give the saints only the words that give life.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We are foolish to give the saints bones to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should give them meat.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should give the saints only food to eat; otherwise, what we give them will harm them.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The ministry of the word is to minister words that are spirit and life and that cause the saints to touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>These words focus on God as man s life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Therefore, we must learn to contact God and fellowship with Him so that our words are God s utterance, and we represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When we give a message, we should not look for deep, new, or strange material.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>A message should be living.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It does not matter whether the content is deep, simple, old, or new.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When we speak, we must follow the inspiration of the Spirit and not care about being logical.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We should follow the impression in our spirit and not care about being thorough or complete.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Logic does not give people life.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Spirit enlivens people and gives them life.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The brothers who minister the word truly need to look to the Lord, because this is a great lack among us.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Many problems among us cannot be solved at this time, because we are short of the words of life.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>May the Lord have mercy on us, and may we know only to give messages concerning the Triune God as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>May we continually learn, experience, and grow in this so that we supply the saints with words of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We may speak on many topics but give only one message.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then the church will be glorious.</S>
