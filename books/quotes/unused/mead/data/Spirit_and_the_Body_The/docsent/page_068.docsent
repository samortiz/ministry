   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GIFTS, MINISTRIES, AND OPERATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After mentioning the diversities of gifts in verse 4, Paul says in verses 5 and 6, "And there are differences of ministries, but the same Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And there are differences of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>. The gifts are by the Spirit, the ministries are of the Lord, and the operations are of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, in these verses we have the Spirit, the Lord, and God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Pentecostalism or in the charismatic movement we hear of the gifts, but not about ministries or operations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seems that those in the charismatic movement know nothing about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The gifts are for the ministries, the ministries are for the operations, the workings, the functions, and the operations are for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the church meetings we need the gifts, the ministries, and the operations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE WORD OF WISDOM</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>AND THE WORD OF KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 8 through 10 the Apostle Paul lists nine gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But this does not mean that there are only nine gifts of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There are more than these nine; however, Paul uses nine as illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Often those in the Pentecostal movement or the charismatic movement ask if we have the manifestation of the gifts in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To them, gifts means speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When asked whether or not we have the gifts in our meetings, some brothers have answered incorrectly that we do not have them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the meetings we have a great deal of the manifestation of the gifts, especially of the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After these two gifts, Paul lists faith, healing, miracles, prophecy, the discerning of spirits, tongues, and the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the order of the gifts in these verses, we see that those in the charismatic movement today make the tail the head and the head the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first two gifts are not tongues and the interpretation of tongues; they are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because we often have the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge in our meetings, we must say that we have the manifestation of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE GIFT OF FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let me say a word about the gift of faith, the third gift.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Day by day we exercise our faith and speak in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I had no faith, I would not be able to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes others ask me why I am so bold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>My answer is that I am bold because I exercise my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because I have faith, I have the assurance that God will work and move according to the word spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Faith is very convincing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It gives us not only power, but also authority.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In all our meetings we exercise at least three gifts: the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In no other Christian group are these gifts manifested more than in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we do not speak, we shall not have the practice of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of the nine gifts listed in 1 Corinthians 12, at least three the word of wisdom, the word of knowledge, and prophecy are related to speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Again I say that we must all learn to utter something in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do this, the Body will be present.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Body exists in our being spiritual, and being spiritual means to speak something from our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Body is not practical until we are spiritual from within our spirit.</S>
