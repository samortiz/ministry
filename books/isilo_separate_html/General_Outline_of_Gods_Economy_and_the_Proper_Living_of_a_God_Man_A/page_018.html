The sequence of the books of the Bible is very meaningful. Romans, the first of the Epistles, begins with God&#8217;s justification and eventually refers to the Body of Christ, yet only in a brief way. Following this, 1 Corinthians speaks concerning the Body of Christ with much emphasis. The Bible covers so many items, but, in brief, the ultimate goal is to produce the Body of Christ. God is alone in eternity; His heart&#8217;s desire is to have the Body of Christ as His organism. Hence, He has an economy to satisfy His heart&#8217;s desire to produce the Body of Christ. Whereas Romans briefly mentions the Body of Christ, the next book, 1 Corinthians, deals with it extensively.<p>Romans refers to the Body of Christ and so does 1 Corinthians. Then what about 2 Corinthians? Second Corinthians is a book on the ministry of the new covenant. We must know, however, that the ministry of the new covenant is for the producing of the Body of Christ. First Corinthians covers the Body of Christ; 2 Corinthians, as an appendix, also speaks of the Body of Christ. What 2 Corinthians tells us is that if we desire to have the Body of Christ, we must have the new covenant ministry. Without the new covenant ministry, there is no possibility to bring forth the Body of Christ.<p>After 2 Corinthians we have Galatians. What is dealt with in Galatians? Galatians covers the matter of Christ replacing the law and being versus religion. This means that it deals with everything that is contrary to the Body of Christ, that is, Judaism, circumcision, and the law. Anything that does not belong to the Body of Christ is dealt with in Galatians.<h2 class=head2>In Ephesians</h2><p>The next book, Ephesians, is obviously on the Body of Christ. Almost every chapter refers to the Body of Christ. Ephesians speaks of the Body of Christ not in a general way but in a detailed and deep way. Hence, if you want to know what the Body of Christ is, you must study the book of Ephesians. Ephesians 1 is on the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, that is, the dispensing of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit, and then there is also the transmission of the ascended and transcendent Christ. Ephesians 1 covers a dispensing and a transmission. The dispensing is of the Triune God, and the transmission is of the transcendent Christ. These two things issue in the church (vv. 22-23). The transmission of Christ is to the church. When Paul mentions the church, immediately he says that the church is the Body of Christ.<p>In Ephesians the strongest emphasis on the Body of Christ is in chapter four. Before such an emphasis on the Body of Christ is given, there is an insertion concerning the identity of the members as the constituents of the Body of Christ. They were once dead in their offenses and sins (2:1-3), but now, as members of the Body of Christ, they are no longer strangers but members of the household of God (v. 19), being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God in spirit (v. 22). Then 4:4 speaks of one Body and one Spirit (the Spirit); it goes on to speak of one Lord and one Father, who is over all, through all, and in all (vv. 5-6). Hence, the Body of Christ involves the Spirit, the Lord, and God the Father. Moreover, God the Father has three aspects: He is over all, through all, and in all. All these added together equal the Body of Christ. If there is only one Body without the Spirit, the Lord, and God the Father, this Body is not the genuine Body of Christ. The Body of Christ can be the Body of Christ because the Spirit, the Lord, and the Father are in the Body.<p>In the Body of Christ the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. Every substance has its element, and within the element is the essence. If you know the Body of Christ to such an extent, you have entered into the depths of this matter. Nevertheless, we still have to see that all the members of the Body of Christ need to be perfected that they may grow up to maturity. It is at this time that out from the Head the Body of Christ builds up itself (4:11-16). From 4:1 through 16 Paul covers the Body of Christ. After verse 16 he goes on to deal with other matters. In summary, the Body of Christ is dealt with in Ephesians 1 and 4, and the house of God is referred to in Ephesians 2. These are the two aspects of the church: On the one hand, the church is the house, the household, of God; on the other hand, the church is the Body of Christ.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
