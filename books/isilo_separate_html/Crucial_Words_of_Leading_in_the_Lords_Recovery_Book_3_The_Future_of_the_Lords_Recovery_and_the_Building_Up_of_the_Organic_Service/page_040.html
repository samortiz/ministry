<p>In 1949 we came to Taiwan to start the work. Before then I was in Shanghai, where we had gained a group of young people, most of whom were students, and some had been saved through my preaching of the gospel. Later, when the political situation in the country changed, I was sent to Taiwan according to the arrangement in the work. At that time, Brother Nee fellowshipped with me that if at all possible, he wanted the group of young people who were under my leading in Shanghai to go to Taiwan. As transportation became available, more than ten of those young people came to Taiwan to receive my leading.</p>
<p>Around 1958 these saints felt that their wings had grown and that they could fly, so they told people, &ldquo;Brother Lee is finished, and the brothers who serve with him are ready to be put into coffins.&rdquo; When I later returned to Taiwan after visiting England and Denmark, these saints were busy meeting in secret, but on the surface they pretended to be under my leading. Many saints were not clear about what they were doing, and even I was not clear.</p>
<p>One of the brothers who served with me in Taipei went to visit the church in Chiayi, and while he was there, this group seized the opportunity to meet with him and tried to persuade him to stand with them. When he returned to Taipei, he fellowshipped with a second brother, and the two decided to invite the young brothers to Taipei. When the young brothers were in Taipei, they were even more open and bold in their attempt to persuade the two brothers to join them in their rebellion. During this time Sister Lee was critically ill, so the two brothers did not tell me anything. In April 1959, after Sister Lee had passed away, as I was preparing to visit the Philippines, the two brothers from Taipei came to see me. They did not feel that it was right for me to leave for the Philippines without knowing the situation with those young brothers. After listening to their fellowship, I told them that according to the principle of the work, those brothers should be stopped from participating in the work. This did not mean that they would be excommunicated from the church; they would still be brothers in the church. However, since they were under my leadership in the work, I had the position and responsibility to stop them from continuing in the work.</p>
<p>I immediately called a meeting in May 1959 of all the co-workers in Taiwan and fellowshipped with them concerning my fellowship with the two brothers from Taipei. I said, &ldquo;Among us one hundred co-workers, there are some who strongly disagree with the work and want to take another way. I would like to tell you that the way I am taking and the work under my leadership will continue; I will absolutely not make any change. If you feel that you have seen something, and if you feel that your way is superior, I hope that you will take your way and not stay here waiting for me to change. I cannot and will not change. I hope you are all clear that we are all brothers in the Lord, and even though I was the one who led you in the beginning, we are still all brothers. But I ask you not to remain here pretending that you are one with me. My position and my resolve are that I will not change. I will continue taking this way. This is the way that Brother Nee helped me to walk, and I will continue to take this way. This is my position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the meeting the two brothers who had fellowshipped with me asked me to be merciful toward the young brothers, saying that because they were still young, they should be given another chance. Some of the older brothers also felt that I should be broad toward the young brothers and give them some time. Hence, I left for the Philippines without any further dealing related to this matter.</p>
<p>At the end of 1959, I held a training in Taipei on the Life-study of the Gospel of John. We had one or two conference meetings a week. During this training I spoke only concerning the first two chapters of John, after which I felt that I should not speak further. As a conclusion I said, &ldquo;In John 2:19 the Lord said, &lsquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rsquo; I know for sure that there are several co-workers here who are doing a destroying work. I would like to tell you that if the work in Taiwan is the Lord&rsquo;s, He will rebuild this work in resurrection, regardless of how much you destroy it.&rdquo; From that day on, I did nothing more&mdash;I tolerated them.</p>
<p>In 1960 I went to America, and I visited several places the following year. I stayed in America for quite some time. After a great deal of consideration, I realized that the Lord had given me a burden, and that He wanted me to stay in America to begin the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery there. I stayed in America from 1961 through 1965; that was a period of about four years. During those four years, the two brothers from Taipei wrote me every one or two weeks concerning the dissenting brothers. In response I always told the brothers to be at peace and to allow the dissenting brothers to do what they could to tear down the work.</p>
<p>In April 1965 the letter I received from the two brothers in Taipei was different from their previous letters. They said that I was the only one with the standing to say anything, and that all the co-workers felt that there was no way for them to continue in the work. I immediately wrote them saying that I would return to Taiwan in September to deal with the matter. In my letter I asked the brothers to make arrangements for me to hold a co-workers&rsquo; meeting the day after I arrived. The first item on the agenda for that meeting was to deal with the problem.</p>
<p>I returned to Taiwan in September, and on the following morning there was a meeting of all the co-workers in Taiwan. At the beginning of the meeting I said, &ldquo;Four of you sitting here have been doing a subversive work ever since I left Taiwan. Hence, I am asking you four to withdraw from the work as of today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon the following day, two of the four came to speak with me at the workers&rsquo; home. I said to them, &ldquo;Brothers, what is there to speak about?&rdquo; They insisted on speaking with me, so the three of us sat down and talked in a small sitting room. One of them said that they did not have any problems with the work, nor with the way of the church, nor with my leadership, nor my authority in the Lord&rsquo;s work. I responded, &ldquo;Brother, is this really true?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;We have no problems.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;This is hard to accept because more than eighty co-workers say that you have a problem.&rdquo; He responded, &ldquo;The two brothers from Taipei made up all the stories about us, and they asked you to come back so that you would be forced to do this to us.&rdquo; This troubled me. They had been undermining the work for many years, and now they were trying to blame others. I asked myself how the church could accept this. Their words confirmed my initial feeling to stop them from participating in the work.</p>
<p>Since the two dissenting brothers insisted that they had no problems with anything in the churches, I asked them how they could explain that the four localities in which they served&mdash;Taipei, Chiayi, Tainan, and Kaohsiung&mdash;had not sung any of the eighty-five new hymns for the past four years, even though all the other localities enjoyed these hymns. This question muzzled their mouths. They were also unable to answer other questions. Hence, I said, &ldquo;Brothers, this situation is a fact. I ask you brothers to withdraw from the work from now on, but you may still attend the church meetings and function as brothers.&rdquo; They brought up the matter of the eldership, and I told them that they also had to withdraw from the eldership; otherwise, the problems would not have a clear resolution. They could stand in the position of brothers and do their best to be good brothers. If they would give the Lord some time, He would vindicate them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> </body></html>
