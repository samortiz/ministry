First, why must a servant of the Lord have a spirit? Second, how do we differentiate between rightness of motive and rightness of spirit? Third, how can we have a noble, clean, and pure spirit? Fourth, what is the result of having a clean spirit?</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for the Spirit in Serving God</h2><p>Watchman Nee: Why must we have a spirit in serving God? This has to do with the levels of life. Different lives have different levels of life, and it is hard for different levels of life to fellowship with each other. For example, the lower forms of animals and the higher forms of animals belong to different levels of life. It is hard for them to communicate with each other. Both birds and insects fly, but the way they fly is different. Every level of life has its own characteristics. It is hard for things with different characteristics to communicate with one another. This does not mean that as long as a life has a good characteristic, it can fellowship with other lives. A dog has a keener sense of smell than man, but this does not mean that it can fellowship with man. Its life is on a different level than man's. We can ask the dog to guard the house, to look for lost objects, or to find people, but it is fruitless to try to fellowship with it or to talk to it about our family affairs or feelings. We cannot fellowship with it.</p><p>Suppose Brother Yu has a dog named Tido. It only has a name, not a surname. We cannot give it a surname and call it Tido Yu, because it does not have a life relationship with Brother Yu. It is not a matter of the dog being good or bad. Its life is on a different level than Brother Yu. Man is a creature mainly of the soul, but God is Spirit. We have to say respectfully that God is also a form of life. Of course, He is the highest form of life. Even if man's wisdom is very great, he cannot possibly fellowship with God. This is the same as saying that Brother Yu's dog may be very clever, but it can never be called Tido Yu, because it is on a different level of life. Brother Yu's son may be very foolish, but he is still Brother Yu's son, and he is still called So-and-so Yu because his life is on the same level as Brother Yu.</p><p>John 4 clearly reveals that God is Spirit and they who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in reality. Everyone who seeks to serve God must serve Him in a spirit that bears the same quality as His Spirit. Our dog is lovely and our son is also lovely. We love them both, but the love we have for our dog is different from the love we have for our son. The Gentiles say that religion is something in the emotion, but John 4 tells us that we cannot serve God by our emotion. We have to serve in the spirit. Not only is our emotion unqualified; even our mind, our will, and everything that comes from our soul are unqualified to serve God. Only by remaining in the spirit can we serve God. We have to pay attention to John 3 and 4. John 4 says that God is Spirit. In order to serve Him we have to exercise our spirit. John 3 says that that which is begotten of the flesh is flesh. What my parents gave to me was just a piece of "flesh." John 3 and 4 are two great pillars in the Bible. John 4 tells us that God is Spirit, and John 3 says that that which is born of the Holy Spirit in a Christian is his spirit. Only the spirit begotten of the Holy Spirit is qualified to serve God. Only it can serve God who is Spirit. If a man does not have new life, he does not have a spirit, even if he has the best conduct. He still cannot please God.</p><p>Two persons can have the same kind of conduct, but they can bear different qualities by virtue of the fact that they belong to different levels of life. We have mentioned before that a bird flies in a different way than an insect. They belong to different levels of life. In the same way, an act that bears the nature of the divine Spirit is different in nature from an act that is void of the Spirit. A monkey can imitate a man. It can act exactly the same way as a man, but it does not have man's life. The quality of its acts is different. There is an analogy between electrical conductivity and spiritual things. Some materials conduct electricity when they are charged, but others cannot conduct electricity regardless of how long they are charged. Rubber and wood do not conduct electricity. This is not a matter of being good or bad in quality but a matter of conductivity. In the same way, if a man wants to serve God with his mind, he can never join himself to God who is Spirit. Only man's spirit can join itself to God who is Spirit.</p><p>In serving the Lord and in touching spiritual things, we can only be joined to God's Spirit in our spirit. If we are living in the mind, will, or emotion, we are "insulators" as far as God is concerned. In order to fellowship with God, the first thing we have to do is be born again. Let me repeat: This is not a matter of being good or bad in quality. Neither is it a matter of being too much or too little in quantity. It is a matter of sameness of quality. A rope, no matter how big and strong it is, can never conduct electricity. But a little wire can conduct electricity as soon as it is charged. In our service to the Lord, we must see clearly that only the spirit can contact God, who is Spirit. Similarly, when Christians come together to fellowship, they can only generate "electricity" when they exercise their spirit. When Christians come together and release their spirits in prayer and speaking, there is the flashing of divine "electricity."</p><p>When a man is regenerated, he receives a new sense from God. This is the sense of the spirit. If a man is impoverished in spirit, he can never fellowship with God or serve Him. Therefore, regeneration is not only crucial to our salvation; it is very much related to our ability to fellowship with God. This is a fundamental Christian truth. As soon as a Christian exercises his spirit toward spiritual things, all problems go away. Before a man believes in the Lord, he may have a thousand questions. He may want his questions answered before he believes in the Lord. But once he believes, even if the thousand questions still remain, he has no more place for them and no need of answers. He has touched his spirit, and all his questions are answered.</p><p>The kingdom of God is something in the Holy Spirit. This is the reason Romans 14:17 says that the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. A man can only touch spiritual things with his spirit. Even if we can imitate a spiritual man's preaching and prayer, those who are experienced will know the kind of persons we really are. Only those who have a spirit and who exercise their spirit can serve God. Romans 7:6 says that we serve God according to newness of spirit. Only by exercising our spirit can we serve God in newness of spirit, and only then can we please God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_076.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_078.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 62: Matured Leadings in the Lord's Recovery (2) &nbsp; pg 77</div><br></body></html>
