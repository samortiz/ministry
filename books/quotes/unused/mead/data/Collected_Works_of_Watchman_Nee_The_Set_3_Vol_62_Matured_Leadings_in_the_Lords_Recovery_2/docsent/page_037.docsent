   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER ATTITUDE IN A MEETING Knowing the Lord's Will</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman Nee: Before every meeting, the responsible brothers must come together to open their hearts to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You have to ask the Lord together: "What do You want to achieve in tonight's meeting?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In every meeting the Lord goes on.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do not take anything for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that since the meetings are regular, one can be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Weigh plays tennis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Surely he does not make his plan at the last minute before the game.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has to consider beforehand.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The same is true with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot meet in a routine way or leave things to chance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to learn to touch the Spirit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not Exercising Human Hands Too Much</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The responsible ones should not take the attitude of a spectator; they should not sit back and watch what the brothers and sisters are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The responsible brothers cannot be passive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They must be active.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Their heart must be open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In leading the saints on, they should not exercise human hands too much.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They should not monopolize everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They should learn to wait and give the Holy Spirit the opportunity to inwardly lead the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Believing in the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>and Touching the Holy Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The responsible ones should also believe that the Holy Spirit will work as long as we do not hinder His work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not need to encourage or stir up the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The heart and spirit of every responsible one must be open.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They must push their spirit out in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some people never open their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that there is something wrong with them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are times in the meetings when the saints cannot lift up the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to charge forward at such times.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes the brothers and sisters go off on tangents, and we have to bring the meeting back on course with hymns, prayers, or speakings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, the responsible brothers cannot be too artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the other hand, they cannot be too loose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must learn to touch the Spirit ourselves first and learn to conduct the meeting according to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The elders and district leaders must come together often to study together.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They should make adjustments for the meetings and correct the meetings as needed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They have to discuss the way the brothers and sisters selected the hymns, prayed, and spoke in the previous meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They may observe that if a brother had stopped his prayer at a certain point, it would have been most excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There was no need for the brother to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The same thing can be said about speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have to adjust and correct the saints one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some people should stop at a certain point; everything they say after that point is redundant.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A person should stop his prayer at the point where the "amen" is the loudest.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But some people pray until all the amens are drained away, and even then they do not stop.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If everyone learns this way, we will be more accurate in touching the Spirit in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Holy Spirit in the church works beyond what we can ask or think.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, we should not expect to receive merely what we hope to receive; we should expect something higher, not something lower.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the meetings a brother may stand up to correct something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His correction may not be accurate, but he may consider himself to be perfectly right.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If, in the course of their fellowship, all the brothers feel that something was wrong with this one's correction, he should put a question mark on what he thinks is right.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Such fellowship will deliver us out of subjectivity and enable us to touch the thought of the Holy Spirit more.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Dealing with the Flesh, yet at the Same Time</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Encouraging Everyone to Function</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a brother or sister is in the habit of speaking contrary things, the elders alone may not be that effective in dealing with him or her.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is the need of a few more brothers and sisters to speak the truth in love to this brother or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is wrong to have love without the liberty to speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes a man speaks the truth, but he does not have love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If you want to correct anyone, you must learn first to pray and then correct him in a spirit of meekness Gal 6:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the same time, you cannot do this in a sectarian way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You cannot base your decision on the idea of a few people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You cannot say that anyone who opposes your will is automatically wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have to be clear about the will of the Spirit and touch the flow of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A brother may decide not to pray after he is rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You have to exhort him and encourage him to pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the one hand, we have to believe in the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the other hand, it will be easy for the flesh to be set loose if we give the brothers and sisters too much liberty.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hence, we must exercise authority to deal with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do not exercise authority, the meetings will be in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At the same time, we must not allow the brothers and sisters to quench their spirit; they must function.</S>
