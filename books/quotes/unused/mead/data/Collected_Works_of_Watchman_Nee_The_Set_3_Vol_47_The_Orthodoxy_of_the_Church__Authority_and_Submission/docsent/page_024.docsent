   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This was how the brothers groped gradually onward, received revelation gradually, and saw the light gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After one year in 1828, Darby published a little book called The Nature and Unity of the Church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This little book was the first among thousands of books published by the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this book Darby clearly declared that the brothers had no intention of setting up a new denomination or union of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He said:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first place, it is not a formal union of the outward professing bodies that is desirable; indeed it is surprising that reflecting Protestants should desire it: far from doing good, I conceive it would be impossible that such a body could be at all recognized as the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It would be a counterpart to Romish unity; we should have the life of the church and the power of the word lost, and the unity of spiritual life utterly excluded...True unity is the unity of the Spirit, and it must be wrought by the operation of the Spirit...No meeting, which is not framed to embrace all the children of God in the full basis of the kingdom of the Son, can find the fulness of blessing, because it does not contemplate it because its faith does not embrace it...Where two or three are gathered together in His name, His name is recorded there for blessing...</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Further, unity is the glory of the church; but unity to secure and promote our own interests is not the unity of the church, but confederacy and denial of the nature and hope of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unity, that is of the church, is the unity of the Spirit, and can only be in the things of the Spirit, and therefore can only be perfected in spiritual persons...</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But what are the people of the Lord to do?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let them wait upon the Lord, and wait according to the teaching of His Spirit, and in conformity to the image, by the life of the Spirit, of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Let them go their way forth by the footsteps of the flock, if they would know where the good Shepherd feeds His flock at noon.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In another place Darby said:</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because our table is the Lord's table, not our table, we receive all whom God receives, all poor sinners fleeing to the Lord for refuge, not resting in themselves, but only in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that same time God worked simultaneously in British Guiana and Italy to raise up the same kind of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1829 there were also meetings in Arabia.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 1830 in Great Britain's London, Plymouth, and Bristol, there were also meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Later, many places in the United States had meetings, and in the continent of Europe there were also many meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Not long afterwards, in almost every place in the entire world, all those who loved the Lord were meeting in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although there was no outward union, yet all were raised up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One feature that marked the rising up of these brothers was that those who were titled and lorded gave up their titles and lordship, those with position gave up their position, those with degrees forsook their degrees, and everyone abandoned any worldly class or rank in the church and became simply the disciples of Christ and brothers one to another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just as the word father is widely used in the Roman Catholic Church and reverend in the Protestant churches, so the word brother is commonly used in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were attracted by the Lord and thus met together; because of their love toward the Lord, they spontaneously loved one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Within the scores of years, from among these brothers God has given many gifts to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Besides J. N. Darby and J. G. Bellett, God granted special ministries to many of the brothers so that His church could be supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>George M ller, who established an orphanage, recovered the matter of praying in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In his lifetime he had over 1,500,000 answers to prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>C. H. Mackintosh, who wrote Notes on the Pentateuch, recovered the knowledge of types.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>D. L. Moody said that if all the books in the entire world were to be burnt, he would be satisfied to have just one copy of the Bible and a set of C. H. Mackintosh's Notes on the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>James G. Deck gave us many good hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>George Cutting recovered the assurance of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His booklet "Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment'' sold thirty million copies by 1930.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Other than the Bible it was the most widely sold writing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>William Kelly wrote many expositions; he was described by C. H. Spurgeon as one whose mind was as big as the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>F. W. Grant was the most learned of the Bible in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Robert Anderson was the man who best knew the book of Daniel in the recent age.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Charles Stanley was the one who best brought people to salvation by preaching the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>S. P. Tregelles was the famous New Testament philologist.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The book on church history by Andrew Miller was the most scriptural among the many church histories.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>R. C. Chapman was a man greatly used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These were the brothers at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we were to recount in detail others among the brothers, the number of all who were greatly used by the Lord would exceed at least a thousand.</S>
