<h2 class="head1">V. ENLIGHTENING RESTS WITH THE MERCY OF GOD</h2>
<p>How can we receive enlightening? What does enlightening depend upon? Speaking from God&rsquo;s side, enlightening rests absolutely on the mercy of God. He will have mercy on whom He will have mercy, and He will have compassion on whom He will have compassion (Rom. 9:15). He who receives revelation is the one to whom God gives revelation. He who obtains enlightening is the one whom God enlightens. It is entirely up to God; it is not up to us. Hence, no one can demand light, and no one can control light. When light comes, it comes without your seeking it. When light does not come, even if you seek it, it does not come. It is just like the rising of the sun. When the sun rises, it rises. You may not want it to rise, but it will not listen to you. When the sun does not rise, it does not rise; though you may want it to rise, it will not listen to you. Likewise, if God enlightens us, we can be enlightened; but if God does not enlighten us, there is nothing we can do. One day on the road to Damascus, Saul, who had opposed God, had no heart to seek light; yet the light from heaven fell upon him, causing him to prostrate himself and be greatly blessed (Acts 9:3-4). God had mercy on him. Thus, the light of God is not controlled by the hand of man, but by the hand of God. It absolutely rests upon the mercy of God.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we want to be enlightened, we can only wait for God, look unto Him, and trust in Him; there is not a bit more that we can do. When we do other things, we can decide by ourselves, but we cannot decide to be enlightened. We cannot say that such and such a brother knows how to read the Bible, and I also know how to read the Bible; he can receive light from the Bible, and I also can receive light from the Bible. It is difficult for all who are thus minded to obtain light.</p>
<p>Some may say that though we cannot control natural light, we can make light of our own by means of electricity or by burning oil lamps or candles. However, if we wish to be enlightened in spiritual matters, we cannot do this. We can only wait for God to shine. If God does not enlighten us, we definitely should not manufacture light ourselves nor seek light ourselves. Concerning this matter, Isaiah 50:10-11 says: &ldquo;Who is among you that feareth Jehovah, that obeyeth the voice of his servant? he that walketh in darkness, and hath no light, let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely upon his God. Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that gird yourselves about with firebrands; walk ye in the flame of your fire, and among the brands that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my hand; ye shall lie down in sorrow.&rdquo; In the entire Bible, this is the passage which speaks most clearly concerning the matter of being enlightened. On one hand, it points out to us the proper way: if we fear God, obey God&rsquo;s voice, and suddenly fall into darkness and have no light, we should not do anything but trust in the name of the Lord, rely upon our God, and wait for the light of God to shine. This is because only God is light, only God is the source of light, and only in the light of God can we see light. On the other hand, this verse also warns us that when we have no light we should not find a way out ourselves by kindling a fire or making our own light. For if we do not wait for God, but instead gird ourselves about with self-made light, though we may walk in the light of our own fire for a time, in the end we shall lie down in sorrow.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also cannot borrow the light of others, taking the light others have received as our own for our use. For example, suppose that someone in a fellowship meeting has testified how, when encountering difficulties, he accepted the dealing of the cross and was thus blessed by God. A certain brother, after hearing such testimony, may be greatly moved, and, upon returning home, may determine from that day forward to accept the dealing of the cross. Though this is neither seeking light by oneself nor manufacturing light by oneself, it is borrowing light from others; it is taking the light that others have received as one&rsquo;s own. He who does this, after not too long a time, will definitely abandon such light. Thus, borrowed light has no use; it cannot take the place of real light.</p>
<p>Those among us who fear God, hear His voice and encounter darkness, should remember not to do anything but trust in God, rely upon God, look wholeheartedly to Him, wait quietly on Him, and seek His mercy once more. Whenever God comes, whenever God bestows mercy, the light of His countenance is our light, His appearing is our vision, and His presence is our gain. If we just touch Him, we see light. The moment He hides His face from us, we are immediately in darkness. No matter how much we strive for light, it is of no use; regardless of how much we struggle, it is in vain. It is not that you are a little loose, so you cannot see light, and that I am a little pious, therefore, light comes; or that you are a little lazy, so you cannot see light, and I am a little diligent, therefore, I see light. Enlightening does not depend on our striving and struggling, but on the mercy of God. Alas, how many there are today who make their own light by lighting lamps and kindling fires. When darkness comes, they do not wait till dawn, till the sun rises; they themselves go to kindle a fire, to make light themselves. God says that all those who kindle a fire to enlighten themselves shall end in sorrow. This is God&rsquo;s decree. What a serious matter this is! May we submit ourselves to fear God and look to Him for mercy.</p>
