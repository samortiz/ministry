   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD S STEPS TO PRODUCE THE ORGANISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God has taken a number of steps to produce this organic body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through creation, He formed a spirit within man Zech 12:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because we have a spirit, we can receive God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has also accomplished the work of redemption, and eventually, He became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now He is not only the Creator and Redeemer He is the very pneuma, the life-giving Spirit, for us to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The moment we contact Him, He comes directly into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The entering of this Spirit into our spirit makes us part of this organic body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now God is growing within us so that He may be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the Lord s desire today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we see that we are part of this divine organism in which God is growing and through which He is being expressed, so many things will fade away.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All our religious concepts regarding worship will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God does not care for our concepts; He wants to be the life growing within us that He may be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the organism revealed in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>AN ALL-INCLUSIVE PICTURE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>OF THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have seen that according to John 15 the preaching of the gospel is the overflow of life for the bearing of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, this is not a simple matter; rather, it is very high and profound.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is much higher than what is commonly considered the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we would gain any understanding of what it means to bear fruit by the overflow of life, we need to see an all-inclusive picture of John s Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This Gospel begins with the words, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One day, the Word became flesh 1:14 , and this flesh was the Lamb of God 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Lord was crucified, He was not only the Lamb to accomplish redemption; He was also in the form of the serpent 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was lifted up on the cross that He might deal with Satan, the old serpent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His death He was not only in the form of the Lamb and the serpent, but also in the form of a grain of wheat 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a grain of wheat, He died to produce the many grains, which include all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 1:4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life was the light of life 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the Word became flesh, He was full of grace and reality, truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus far, we have ten significant words: the Word, God, flesh, Lamb, serpent, grain, life, light, grace, and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ was the Word, who was God and who became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This flesh was the Lamb who was crucified for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In His crucifixion Christ was in the form of the serpent to destroy the devil, and in His death He fell into the ground as a grain of wheat to produce many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These many grains now have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This life has become their light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To them, this life is grace, and this light brings them reality.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>CHRIST S INDWELLING MAKING US A PART</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>OF THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the Lord Jesus died, resurrected, and secretly ascended to the Father, He came back on the same day and, with a physical body, entered a closed room in a mysterious way 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No scientist or scholar can explain how Christ was able to enter into that room.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to 20:22, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Apparently, this is the conclusion of the Gospel of John; actually, this Gospel has not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord s breathing into His disciples indicates that this mysterious One, the all-inclusive One, had come into them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In John chapter twenty there is no record that the Lord left the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He came, but He did not go away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After breathing into them, He did not say, Good-bye.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I will visit you again another day.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When I read this chapter as a young man, I was troubled by the fact that there is no record here telling us that the Lord went away from the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later I realized that when the Lord breathed into them, He came into them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was no longer outside the disciples; He was within them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the beginning, that is, in eternity past, Christ was far away in both space and time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He existed as the Word, as God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But by the end of the Gospel of John, He has come into us in a mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as no one can define or explain how One with a physical body that could be touched and seen could enter into a closed room, so no one can explain how Christ indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The principle is the same in each case.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ s indwelling is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the beginning of this book, Christ was far away from us, but now He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As far as space and time are concerned, there is no longer any distance between Him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He and we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Furthermore, Christ has made us a part of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This oneness is the organism illustrated by the grapevine, the organism of the Triune God with humanity in the divine dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today we are in this organism.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We all need a clear vision of this.</S>
