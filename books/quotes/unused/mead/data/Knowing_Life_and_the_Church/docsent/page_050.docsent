   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Needing Man in His Work</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once we see that God s work requires man s cooperation, we will realize that man has an important place in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is quite different from our prayers, which often include the thought that we are nothing and that the Lord can work without us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not God s thought.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, we should pray, Lord, without us, You cannot work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a prayer that is according to the truth and according to God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although God the Almighty created the heavens and the earth, those who know God will say, God, You can work only when You have us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without us, You cannot work at all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If there were no people on the island of Taiwan, how could God preach the gospel?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout the years we have realized from our experience that even though God is almighty, there are things that He cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His inability to do certain things relates to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although God can do everything, He cannot force us to move.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He may move in us for many years, but we still may not rise up to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God can do everything in the universe, but He cannot force us to rise up early or read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God needs our cooperation; He cannot do many things in us because, even though He is almighty, there are many limitations in us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With God there is eternity past; with man there is eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As God journeys from eternity past to eternity future, there is a bridge of time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This bridge of time is really man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God wants to cross from one side to the other through man, but many people have a sign that says Not a Through Street.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When God makes a demand on us, we often shake our head to indicate that the road is blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God makes a demand, we often respond, But I have a wife, children, and...</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our but means that God cannot pass through us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In eternity God is not under any restriction, but in time God is restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we will not allow God to pass through, God cannot do anything in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We restrict God the most.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, God is patient.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When He cannot get through in us, He will wait patiently and call us again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not listen to Him, He will wait some more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He will wait until we are touched by Him and say to Him, O God, I will say yes to You.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I will no longer say but or Not a Through Street.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will only say Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we hear the Lord s word and forsake everything to follow Him, we will not be like the disciple who said to the Lord, Permit me first to go and bury my father Matt 8:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s principle in redemption is that man would cooperate with Him and that man would be a bridge for Him to pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should never consider this as a doctrine only.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the whole earth, regardless of when or where, God will be expressed as long as we are willing to say, God, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I want to be a smooth way to let You pass through.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God always works in the principle of incarnation, that is, in the principle of God mingling with man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some brothers like to ask, How do we give a message and speak for God?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can study this matter and discover thousands of requirements, but we cannot ignore this one basic question: Do we allow God to pass through us and mingle with us?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not have a clear understanding about this point, regardless of how well we speak, our speaking will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must see that God requires man to cooperate with Him in His work; man s cooperation is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Without man s cooperation, God s way is blocked.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we prostrate ourselves before God and allow Him to pass through us, God s glory will be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In our fellowship with God and in our reading of the Bible and prayer before the Lord, will we answer His call unconditionally when we hear His voice?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Or will we say however and but?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How many of us can say yes to the Lord, or Lord, I will take this way ?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our usefulness in the Lord s hand depends upon how much we cooperate with Him; how far He can go in us depends entirely upon how absolute our Amen is to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are sinful and corrupt, we tend to lose our temper, and we always blame others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>From our experience in following the Lord, we know that these are hindrances to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, our unwillingness to submit to the Lord absolutely is the greatest hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some brothers and sisters never offend others, but they are not useful to the Lord because when they respond to Him, they say yes and then say but.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is like a bridge that is well-constructed and clean but with a sign that blocks it, saying Not a Through Street.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do we want to be this kind of bridge?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Another bridge may be old and broken, but the Lord can still cross over because it is open for passage.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some believers may be like a broken bridge, but the Lord can still pass through them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There was a sister in Shanghai who was born of a high-class family.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Both she and her husband were highly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Before she became a Christian, all her relatives and neighbors praised her meekness and elegance.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Later, she believed in the Lord and continued to conduct herself in a well-tempered way.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Another sister was bad-tempered before she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After she was saved, she still quarreled with others frequently, and she was far inferior to the meek sister in the way she treated her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thus, this sister truly admired the meek sister for her elegance and gracefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The rough sister loved the Lord very much, and she would come to every meeting, often praying with tears because of her realization that she was short in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One day the meek sister complained to the brothers about the rough sister.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She pointed out that the sister would put on a head covering and pray very spiritual and inspiring prayers in the meeting but then fiercely quarrel with others at home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While we should not quarrel or argue, is anything gained by only being meek and by refraining from quarreling?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although the meek sister behaved very well, she always said but when the Lord made a demand on her.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What is the difference between this and being quarrelsome?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We may be perfect, but what good is it if we cannot be a bridge to let God pass through?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am not saying that we should be rough, but I want to illustrate that God wants a person who will let Him pass through and cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We absolutely must see that God is not looking for meek and perfect people in His work; rather, He needs people who will cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Without man s cooperation, God cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>May we not be proud but pray: O God, You can work without me, but if You have me, it will be easier for You to work.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I do not want to delay Your time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God truly needs our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Man Needing God in God s Work</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we have seen that God needs our cooperation, we will realize that we cannot be independent from God in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>On the one hand, we know that if God does not have us, He cannot get through; on the other hand, if we do not have Him, we cannot move.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to tell Him, O God, I thank You that I have been shown mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Because of Your creation and redemption, I have You and I am even becoming You, but I am still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God, You cannot work without me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You need me, and You need man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should all lift up our head and be encouraged to pray in this way by God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Furthermore, we need to tell Him, Without You, I cannot do anything; I need You.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we put these three matters together, we will arrive at one great principle: God s work of redemption is carried out by God and man working together.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All work originates from God, not from man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Man is needed in all His work, and God cannot do anything without man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God is needed for all His work as well, and man cannot do anything without God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The most important matter for one who serves the Lord is his relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The degree of our cooperation with God determines the degree to which we can touch and contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The second matter is morality.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We need morality to maintain our position before man.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If we do not have morality before man, regardless of how much knowledge we have before God, we will not have any position to speak before men.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>As we serve and work for the Lord, we should spend much time to fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we do anything, we should continually contact the Lord within and continually consecrate ourselves to the Lord and cooperate with Him.</S>
