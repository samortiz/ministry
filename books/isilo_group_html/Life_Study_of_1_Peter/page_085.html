Verse 7 says, &ldquo;But the end of all things has drawn near; therefore, be soberminded and be sober unto prayers.&rdquo; All things on which the flesh rests will pass away, and the end of them, the apostle tells us here, has drawn near. This warns us that a life lived in the flesh in the lusts of men (v. 2) will soon be ended, for it is related to all things which will shortly pass away. Therefore, we should be soberminded and be sober unto prayers. Literally, to be soberminded is to be of a sound mind; it is to have a mind of sobriety, able to understand things properly and thoroughly without being disturbed. Furthermore, to be sober unto prayers is to be sober to watch; hence, vigilant. This is to be on guard; hence, sober unto prayer. This equals the Lord&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;Watch and pray&rdquo; (Matt. 26:41; Luke 21:36).</p><p>We need to realize that all things will come to an end. Peter says that the end of all things has drawn near. Therefore, instead of loving material things, we should be soberminded and be sober unto prayers. Do not set your mind on a better home, a better car, or a better education. The end of all such things has drawn near.</p><h2 class="head1">LOVE AND HOSPITALITY</h2><p>Verse 8 continues, &ldquo;Before all things having fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins.&rdquo; Love must be first.</p><p>In verse 9 Peter says, &ldquo;Be hospitable to one another without murmuring.&rdquo; Peter wrote this verse according to his experience. He knew that hospitality can be troublesome. Because the saints love the Lord, the church, and the ministry, they are willing to extend hospitality to those visiting from other localities. However, the saints who show hospitality may be hospitable with murmuring. Some may complain about how a saint who once stayed with them conducted himself. This is murmuring. I hope that our hospitality will be without murmuring.</p><h2 class="head1">GOOD STEWARDS OF THE VARIED GRACE OF GOD</h2><p>Verse 10 continues, &ldquo;Each one according as he has received a gift, ministering it among yourselves as good stewards of the varied grace of God.&rdquo; The varied grace of God, as the all grace in 5:10, is the rich supply of life, which is the Triune God ministered into us in many aspects (2 Cor. 13:14; 12:9). As good stewards, by the gift we have received we should minister to the church and the saints such grace, not merely doctrine or any vain thing.</p><p>The fact that verse 10 is the direct continuation of verse 9 indicates that even showing hospitality is a gift. Showing hospitality to others gives us an excellent opportunity to minister to them the varied grace of God. You need grace to prepare food for your guests, to provide transportation for them, and to help them with special needs. It takes patience to wait for them if they are late. By this we see that in our hospitality we need to minister the varied grace of God to others. Of course, in verse 10 Peter does not mean that we minister grace only in hospitality. He means that we minister grace according to whatever gift we have received.</p><p>In verse 11 Peter says, &ldquo;If anyone speaks&mdash;as oracles of God; if anyone ministers&mdash;as out of the strength which God supplies; that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might unto the ages of the ages. Amen.&rdquo; The &ldquo;oracles&rdquo; here are the divine speakings or utterances as revelations. In the ministry of grace, as mentioned in verse 10, our speaking should be God&rsquo;s speaking, God&rsquo;s utterance, that conveys divine revelation.</p><p>In verse 11 Peter mentions the strength which God supplies. God supplies to us the serving strength of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life through the Spirit of Christ (Phil. 1:19; 4:13).</p><h2 class="head1">GOD GLORIFIED THROUGH CHRIST IN ALL THINGS</h2><p>The goal of speaking as oracles of God and ministering in the strength that God supplies is that &ldquo;in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; This indicates that all our ministry of grace, whether in speaking or in serving, should be full of Christ, so that God may be glorified through Christ in all things.</p><p>Peter concludes verse 11 with the words, &ldquo;To whom is the glory and the might unto the ages of the ages. Amen.&rdquo; The relative pronoun &ldquo;whom&rdquo; refers to God. The glory and the might belong to God. Glory is without, and might is within. Might supplies the strength within us; glory is God glorified upon us. Hence, &ldquo;glory&rdquo; corresponds to &ldquo;glorified,&rdquo; and &ldquo;might&rdquo; to &ldquo;strength.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_084.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_086.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Peter &nbsp; pg 85</div><br></body></html>
