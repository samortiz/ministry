   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to enrich and enliven our meeting, we must learn how to speak the word of the Lord in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must learn to speak and not just read the word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must also learn to have a corporate speaking of the word in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This practice is new among the Lord s children.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Everyone in the meeting should exercise his spirit and pay much attention to speaking and listening.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When one speaks, the others should listen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we have the speaking that utters and releases the holy word, the riches of God s word will be prevailing to touch all the attendants.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order to be a speaking one in our meetings, we should be people with a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without a proper living, our speaking will have no backing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our daily living, our character, or what we are, is the real backing of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the previous chapter we saw eight points concerning the kind of persons we need to be so that we can be the proper speaking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In this chapter we want to see nine more aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SPEAKING CHRIST TO ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>DAILY IN SEASON AND OUT OF SEASON</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to be those who speak Christ to all kinds of people daily in season and out of season Acts 5:42; 8:4; 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should speak Christ to people from every tribe, tongue, people, and nation Rev 5:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Mark 16:15 the Lord Jesus charged us to preach the gospel to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that we should pick up the burden for the preaching of the gospel to such an extent that we would speak to whatever is around us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should speak to the mountains, the trees, the rivers, the animals, and the entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we practice this, we will become exercised in speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This will strengthen us to speak with power.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we speak awkwardly, that will weaken our speaking and even weaken the contents of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why we should practice speaking Christ all the time even though no person may be present.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We always have the entire creation to speak to.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am grateful to the Lord that I practiced this when I was a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I talk to the saints about the matter of speaking, some tell me that it is not the right time for them to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to their realization, no time is the right time for us to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But we have much time to talk on the telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It seems that every hour is available for gossip, but no time is available for speaking Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why Paul charged Timothy to speak the word of God in season and out of season 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether the time is the right time or the wrong time for us to speak, we still have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In season or out of season, we have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our obligation is to speak forth Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To speak Christ is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we gossip or speak foolishly, we make ourselves useless.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing can destroy our speaking of Christ like a telephone call.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To gossip on the telephone is a real temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The telephone is a part of American life, but we should not be addicted to talking on it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes the telephone can be like fly paper.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we get stuck to it, we cannot get away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we indulge in vain talk on the telephone, the more we kill our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes after talking on the telephone, we are unable to pray because our loose talk has deadened us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why would we not talk to people about the Lord and about the holy Word?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should learn to save our time and even our spirit by escaping from unnecessary talk on the telephone.</S>
