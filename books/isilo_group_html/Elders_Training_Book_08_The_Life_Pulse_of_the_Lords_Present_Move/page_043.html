<h1 class="title">BASIC PRINCIPLES IN THE ELDERSHIP<br />
AND THE TRAINING OF THE FULL-TIMERS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">RECONSIDERING THE ELDERSHIP IN EACH LOCALITY</h2>
<p>In this chapter we want to fellowship some principles in the matter of handling the eldership in the churches. The Lord has given us a new start with a new way to practice the church life. A number of churches have been existing in the United States for over twenty years and the eldership has gone through very much. In a good sense, it has been tested quite much. According to the past, the present elders should have some realization of the condition of the eldership in their locality. Has the eldership in your place been prevailing? Some of the elders may have become a little old. You also may have discovered some younger brothers in your locality who are not in the eldership but who may be more useful in taking care of the church&rsquo;s leading. Based upon these facts, the situation of the eldership in your locality should be reconsidered. I do not have the time to go to every place to help the arrangement of the eldership. Almost every church in the United States has been fully established and even founded. Thus, in a sense the elders in each locality are quite capable of helping the eldership there.</p>
<p>You have to consider the eldership in your locality according to these three points: (1) should the present elders resign or not, and is this necessary or profitable? (2) are there some new ones who are younger that might be quite useful in the eldership? (3) if the present elders remain (all or some), do some brothers need to be added who would be helpful and useful in the eldership? Because we are honest and we are for the Lord&rsquo;s business, for the profit of the church, and for the recovery as a whole, we should have a sober consideration and proper evaluation of the need of the eldership in our locality. You as an elder need to consider whether or not you are a real profit in your locality. My feeling and observation regarding the eldership in your place may not be that thorough because I have not been there for some time. I would ask all the elders throughout the United States to consider the eldership in their locality. Some of the present elders may feel honestly, fairly, and rightly that they are not so useful in the eldership. It may be that you would be more useful if you were not in the eldership. If this is the case and this is the feeling, it is better for you to take the initiative to resign. You should know the situation of the church in your locality and the real situation of the eldership. You also should know if it will be profitable for you to remain in the eldership or more profitable for you to stay away from the eldership. If you decide to stay away from the eldership in this light, this is something beautiful.</p>
<p>Any kind of office or post for an organization or other concern usually has a term that goes with it. The President of the United States has a four-year term, a Congressman has a two-year term, and a Senator has a six-year term. But there is no hint in the New Testament which tells us how long a brother should remain in the eldership. The only point we can find is in 1 Timothy 5:19-20 which indicates that the saints could appeal the matter of a sinning elder to the appointing apostles. The apostles do have the standing to deal with a wrongdoing elder. Even in 1 Timothy 5, however, Paul does not tell us what should be done with the wrongdoing elder after he is rebuked and dealt with.</p>
<p>Humanly speaking, some elders who become more experienced will be more useful. But on the other hand, human beings may not be so strong, so healthy, or so capable for a certain post as when they were younger. As elders who love the Lord and who love the recovery, we should consider the situation of the eldership in our local church. Only the elders know the real situation in their locality. The church life is like a family and the elders should be the fathers. At a certain time, a father should know whether it would be better to let his son take care of the family. The emperor of a certain country may be too old to adequately carry out his commission and duty, while his son would be more capable. Whether this should be done or not depends upon the emperor&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<p>In this matter the elders should neither be polite nor be afraid of anything, but they should be honest. This fellowship should help all the elders to reconsider the eldership in their respective localities. Whether we stay in the eldership or stay away depends upon the real profit of our staying or not staying. What is the best for the profit of the church? I do not think anyone can make this decision on your behalf. Only you can do this.</p>
<p>You may have realized that there are some younger ones in your locality who are really much better. If so, you should give in. This is not a matter of politeness but a matter of whether or not the church will receive more profit. If you feel that it would be more profitable for you to stay, then you have to stay. You all need to forget about your ambition, your politeness, or any other motives. You should only take care of the profit of the church in your locality. We need to do this by really meaning business with the Lord because we like to see that the new start in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be much blessed. The key and the hinge to this new start is the eldership. Regardless of how much we will be in the one accord, if the eldership is not so proper, that will be a big minus. We realize that we are not that strong, but something better could be worked out. We have to admit that mostly no church is up to the standard, so let us admit our shortage. However, according to what we have and what we are, we need to make a decision concerning what the best way is for the eldership in our locality.</p>
<p>Some of the leading brothers have been in their locality a long time and it might be more profitable for them to go to another locality and let some new ones take the lead in the leadership. They could go to another locality to have a new church started or go to another local church. Then some younger ones can begin to bear the responsibility of the practical leadership. There is also the need for some to take the lead among the Chinese-speaking saints.</p>
<p>In some localities, the eldership really needs some help. A brother who is in the lead may be a &ldquo;floating&rdquo; person. He may not be in his locality that much and yet he may be taking the lead there. It may be more profitable for him to travel and to take care of his burden with the ministry. Thus, the eldership in his locality will need strengthening.</p>
<p>The loss we have suffered in the eldership in some localities has been due to the dissenting. Some brothers may have become good elders, but they were dissenting. Their dissenting was mostly due to their character. They have a dissenting character. It is hard for them to be one in anything. Dissension has eaten up these brothers. We would like to see them perfected, but it seems that there has been no way. As a result, we suffered the loss. These dear brothers were the right persons in their age (in their early forties) and they did have a history in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I say this to warn all of us. We all have to kill our own dissension and condemn it. Dissension is a big eater. It has somewhat eaten up the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>We may need to bring some younger brothers into the eldership, but we also need to take Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Timothy 3:6&mdash;&ldquo;Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment of the Devil.&rdquo; Novices should not bear the eldership. This may open the door for the subtle one to seduce them into human pride. Then it will damage them. Not one among the eighty elders appointed in Taipei is under thirty. To be under thirty is too young. Even the Lord Jesus began to minister when He was thirty (Luke 3:23). In the priesthood an apprentice should be twenty-five (Num. 8:24) and the full priesthood is realized at the age of thirty. Thirty is the full age for God&rsquo;s service (Num. 4:3, 35, 39, 43, 47).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
