   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some have asked, "If this is the case, why do we sin again?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the old man has already been crucified and if we have the new man, why do we still sin?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This leads us to a new question.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What should we do to realize God's accomplished facts?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A mistake that many people make is that they change God's facts into promises.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The old man has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, some think that God has only promised to crucify the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They think that they should ask God to crucify the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever they sin, they think that their old man is still not crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So they again ask God to crucify it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever they encounter temptations, they think that the old man has not been dealt with, and they again ask God to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They do not realize that God's facts are different from His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has done many things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Facts are not things that God has promised to do.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we do not need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not need to have more zealous prayers, but to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Toward God's facts, we must only believe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we believe, we will have the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Fact, faith, experience this is the order that God has ordained, and this is a great principle in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We only need to do this: First, we should know God's facts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God must reveal them to us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second, after we know God's fact concerning a certain matter, we should lay hold of God's Word and believe that we are already according to His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's fact says it and we are what His Word says.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Third, we should exercise this faith and thank God that we are what He says we are and should live according to what we already are.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fourth, whenever temptations and trials come, we should believe that God's Word and facts are more reliable than our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All we have to do is fully believe in God's Word; He will be responsible for giving us the experience.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we only pay attention to our experience, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should pay attention to believing in God's fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is our only responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can commit our experience to God because it is His responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The basis for a Christian's experience is Romans 6:6.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All we have to do is to allow God's Spirit to show us how our old man is crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we should lay hold of God's Word and believe that we are dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After this, we should live as if we are already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even when temptations come and tell us that we have not died, we should still believe more in what God has done than in our feelings and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do this, experience will follow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should note that God's fact does not become real by doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, we do this because God's fact is already real.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If our old man has not died, we could pray and ask Him to crucify it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But if the crucifixion is an accomplished fact and we still ask God to accomplish it again, then there is nothing more to say except that we are entirely lacking in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May we have greater faith before God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I admit that if I had not personally passed through my sickness in the past three years, I would not have known what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In many places I have seen many dear brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But I have seldom seen a person who believes in God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Faith is believing that whatever God has said means exactly what He has said.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is believing that everything is according to God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has said that the old man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that our old man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a fact that our old man is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A fact is something that God has accomplished through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No one can say anything more about it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God sent His Son to accomplish everything for us and told us, through the Bible, what He accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now what He has accomplished is finished; God can do nothing more, and we should do nothing more than accept it before Him with a humble heart and believe that His Word is real.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May our hardened hearts and evil hearts of unbelief be removed so that we will receive God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Many people do not realize the importance of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They think that obedience is more important.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Actually, faith and obedience are equally important in the Bible and on our spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Faith comes first, then obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A man must have faith before he can obey.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a man wants to obey before he believes, he is a "wretched man" indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must have faith because facts only require our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Faith is the only means of turning facts into experience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's facts are almost exclusively in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This means that God's facts can only become facts in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Since God's facts are in Christ, we can only enjoy these facts when we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we believe in Christ and are joined to Him, we can experience God's accomplished facts in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We must remember that apart from Christ, these things are no longer real.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They are only real in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Being in Christ means we are joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This happened when we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Although many people are in Christ, they do not abide in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They do not exercise their faith to stand on the position that God has given them in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Consequently, they lose the realization of God's fact.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Brothers, faith is truly important.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only when we believe are we in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Only when we abide in Christ are God's facts our facts.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May God open our eyes today to see that we are already dead, resurrected, and ascended in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We should believe that we are this way in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whenever we do not have faith, we are living outside of Christ and cannot experience the facts that are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Oh, may God grant us the faith!</S>
