   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICAL PROBLEMS IN SPREADING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to consider two practical problems that we have encountered.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, as much as possible we must avoid the practice of sisters baptizing people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we knock on doors, we should not let the sisters baptize males, but the sisters can be allowed to baptize females.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Suppose after preaching the gospel in a home that both the husband and the wife are willing to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sisters can baptize the wife, and if there is no brother present, the sisters should make an arrangement for the husband to be baptized later.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They can even arrange for the husband to be baptized in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under no circumstance is it appropriate for our young sisters to baptize a male.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even if the sister is older, it is still not appropriate for her to baptize a male.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During baptism, a person s clothing might not cover his entire body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is therefore best to avoid such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, I hope that every locality will have a gospel van and a telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first wave of saints who went to the towns and villages were equipped with two ten-passenger vans per team.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In every locality there should be at least one ten-passenger van.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Transportation in the rural areas is not convenient; buses do not run frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, these vans can be used to transport saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Most saints do not own cars, and it may take them one or two hours to walk to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is burdensome.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It would be wonderful to have a vehicle that can transport ten saints to the meeting in one trip.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a locality where forty people meet together, if half of them require a ride, we will only need to make two trips.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, if each of the one hundred newly established churches has a van, there will be one hundred gospel vans.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The vans will all be of the same make and the same shape with a logo, such as God loves the world or Jesus is Lord, painted on them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When these one hundred vans travel from town to town, the townspeople will know that these are the gospel vans of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every church must have a van and a telephone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then when the sisters go to preach the gospel and a person is willing to be baptized, they can contact the brothers to come and assist them in the baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are some matters that we should pay attention to and for which we should be prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In addition, we should not be timid or frightened when we preach the gospel to people who are older, more experienced, rather accomplished, or famous.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not feel that we are too young, inexperienced, or unqualified to speak to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should be bold and speak Christ to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should preach the gospel and dispense Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even if the person we are speaking to is the head of a big company or a college professor with a wealth of human experiences, he does not have Christ or the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can boast that we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They may have something that they can boast of, but we have even more of which to boast.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should simply present Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This should be our exercise and our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Philippians 3:8 Paul said, I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse should help us deal with different kinds of people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should read Philippians 3 and pray over the verses to apply these verses to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to experience Christ as our riches and as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I trust that this experience will help us in speaking to people who have positions in society.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE STEPS OF THE WORK OF SPREADING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By improving our arrangement in the work and by taking care of housing, we have taken care of the full-timers in every way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we are still concerned about the steps of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The record in the Bible shows that there are four major steps in a Christian s work for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The first step is to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The second step is to nourish people after they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The third step is to gather the new believers whom we are nourishing into small group meetings so that they may know one another in the Lord and fellowship together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A small group can begin with seven or eight people and gradually increase in number until it can be split into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The fourth step is to bring the new ones to participate in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In particular, we must bring them to the big meeting on Lord s Day morning for them to practice prophesying together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In conclusion, we need to preach the gospel to lead people to salvation, and we need to nourish the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we should connect a new one with eight or nine others in a small group for mutual care and perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We also need to bring the new believers to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In particular, they need to prophesy in the Lord s Day morning meeting for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the past we emphasized knocking on doors to visit people and baptize them, but now we must emphasize these four steps.</S>
