   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Special Visitation</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are always special occasions which arise in the families of the brothers and sisters, such as marriages and funerals.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All these occasions call for visitation and consolation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Special visitation includes receiving and sending off out-of-town visitors.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many brothers and sisters come to Hong Kong from other places for a week only.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If they do not meet any brothers during their stay here, they will feel that this is a lonely and inhospitable place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They will feel that the church does not look like a church at all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If five brothers come to Hong Kong today, we have to visit them immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to find out if they have any difficulty in lodging or in finding direction.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to find out which church they are from.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By warming their heart we may set their whole church on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should pay a visit to any brother or sister who is passing by.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should render them practical help, fellowship with them, and get to know their church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some churches are over ten years behind others in terms of life and spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we establish good fellowship with the visiting brothers, and they receive our help, they will pass on the help to their church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way our visitation will be the same in effect as sending these ones out in a migration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The local brothers sometimes travel abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may go to Canton, Swatow, or southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a brother leaves us, we often lose contact with him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When our brothers go away, we have to send them away like sending away missionaries.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When a brother moves to another place, we must not only send him off with a letter of recommendation; we must assign a special person to correspond with him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The letter of recommendation should only be the first letter regarding him; it should not be the last letter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders should write to the locality and inquire about his condition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After two weeks, they should write a third letter to follow up on the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times good brothers are lost as a result of moving to a new place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the responsible brothers in the other localities are reminded again and again, they will know that the brothers in Hong Kong are persistent and that they should not ignore them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should never allow a person to leave and become lost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Of course, this works the same way for brothers moving in from other localities; we cannot drop them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of the responsible brothers in the districts are too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They can assign other brothers and sisters to write and maintain correspondence with the travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can write to these travelers and tell them about the message covered during the last Lord's Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not let go until we know that our brothers and sisters are well established and settled.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way we will be able to answer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The elders have to make sure that the district's responsible brothers are faithful in the assignment of this work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Closed Brethren in England do a marvelous work in this kind of visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some of their brothers work as sailors.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We know that sailors are just about the most unsettled kind of people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But these brothers look for places to meet wherever they go.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Shanghai sailors looked us up often.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once a sailor knocked on my door late at night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I was surprised that he had my address.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When asked about it, he told me that the responsible brothers from his locality had given it to him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These sailors came and went frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One time one of them was sick and stayed four months.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He would come and visit me a few times a week.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the meetings he would sit in the last row.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Sometimes he would read letters that he had received from brothers of his local assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The letters would keep him informed of what one brother had said and what another sister had prayed, etc. It seemed as if the whole church was following him wherever he went.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE LORD IS TAKING THE WAY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is advancing step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today the Lord is taking the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This way requires the whole church to rise up to serve together.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In fact, it is not enough for all the saints to rise up; they have to coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church must never relax on these three kinds of visitations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They must be covered properly in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the whole congregation serves this way, the Body will be built up, and day by day the church will move closer to the glorious church spoken of in the Bible, and more and more it will be known as a spiritual church.</S>
