<h2 class="head1">BEHOLDING CHRIST AND NOT OURSELVES</h2><p>I do not have time to go into detail concerning the matter of being in Christ. There are countless spiritual blessings in Christ such as holiness, victory, power, spirituality, faith, spiritual progress, humility, endurance, and love. Every spiritual blessing that you can imagine is in Christ. The worst kind of Christians are those who look inward instead of outward. If you search within yourself to see whether or not there is holiness, I can tell you the answer right now&mdash;you will find no goodness within. God has saved us. But we often forget that God has saved us in Christ. We often think, "I am saved. But why is my temper still so bad? Why am I still so proud? Why is there still so much uncleanness in me?" You wish you could overcome, and you begin to consider yourself to see whether you have endurance, humility, holiness, etc. Please remember that as soon as you look within, you will not find any endurance, humility, or holiness. On the contrary, you will find uncleanness, temper, pride, and all kinds of sins. Why is this? It is because you have forgotten that God's way of salvation is in Christ, not in yourself. Humility is in Christ. Endurance is in Christ. Holiness is in Christ. Everything is in Christ. In yourself you are always unclean and defiled. But when you live in Christ, you have everything. When you live in yourself, nothing will change.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING JOINED TO CHRIST,<br />AND ENJOYING EVERYTHING IN HIM</h2><p>Never think that God is doing something within you independently. What is within you is still uncleanness, evilness, unholiness, and pride. God's grace is not bestowed upon you, but upon Christ. When you are joined to Christ, everything of Christ will be transmitted into you. When you are cut off from Christ, all of your filthiness will come back. This is like connecting a pipe to clean water; the result is clean water. But if you connect a pipe to dirty water, the result is dirty water. After you are saved, you think that you should at least be better than before. You think that your old Adam will gradually change. But God has to prove to you that this is not possible. No, there is not such a thing! As long as you are in old Adam you will still be unclean. Only Christ can make you different. Only when you are in Christ will there be any change. How does a lamp shine? The lamp does not shine by itself. It shines when an electrical current passes through it. The same is true with Christians. All virtues and power, as well as the fruit of the Spirit, are found in Christ. As long as you are joined to Christ, you will have all of these. This is the same as saying that electricity is in the power plant. When the lamp is joined to the power plant, it shines. Being in Christ is being joined to Christ and being related to Him. When this happens, His power and His everything will be transmitted to you. It is not wrong to say that the lamp is shining. But strictly speaking, it is not the lamp that is shining, but the electricity shining through the lamp. The lamp overcomes darkness with the light of electricity.</p><p>When I was ten years old, I saw an electric lamp for the first time. At that time I marveled at it very much. It was clearly a lamp, but how could it suddenly light up? I waited until it had shined for two hours. Then I moved it to a dark room, thinking that it would continue to shine. However, it stopped shining as soon as I moved it away. The lamp went dark. It did not have any light in itself; it was dark in itself. It shined only when it was in contact with the power station.</p><p>We were all in darkness. But when we were put into Christ, we began to shine, and we began to be patient and humble. Yet we forget that the reason these things exist is because we are in Christ. After having been a Christian for a few years, we begin to think that these things are ours. Little do we realize that once we are separated from Christ, we have nothing.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AND NOT I</h2><p>First John 5 says that God has given His life to us in Christ. He has not given His life to us independent of Christ. Suppose I wrap a piece of iron in some paper. When I take the paper, I take the iron as well. "He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life" (5:12). Apart from Christ, we cannot have anything. Nothing is given to us independently. Everything is given to us in Christ. If we know and believe this fact, we will be so happy that we will not go to sleep tonight. It is of God that we are in Christ; we have no part in this work. Everything is Christ and not us. When we see this, we will realize that there is no hope in us at all. We cannot change at all, and we cannot improve at all. Just as a lamp cannot shine when it is not connected to electricity, we have nothing in ourselves when we are cut off from Christ. If there is any difference or change in us today, it is not because we have changed in ourselves. Everything is in Christ and everything depends on Christ. It is all of Christ, not of us. This is God's way of salvation.</p>
