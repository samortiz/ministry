   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Noah Saved by the Pitched Ark</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>from God's Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Undoubtedly Noah was under God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He was also under the evil power of the age in which he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Noah built an ark which was pitched within and without with pitch.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The pitch was a type of the redeeming blood.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Thus, Noah was saved from God's judgment by the pitch upon the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Noah Saved through the Judging Water</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>from the Condemned World</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What saved Noah from that evil age?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The flood sent by God as a judgment upon the evil world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That judging flood separated Noah from that age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The water of the Red Sea buried the Egyptians and separated the children of Israel from the Egyptian world, and the waters of the flood did the same thing for Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the one hand, the flood judged that evil age; on the other hand, it separated Noah from that age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The water that judged the world saved Noah from that evil generation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result of the two aspects of God's full salvation, Noah was saved from God's condemnation as well as from that evil generation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hardly any Christians know about the second aspect of God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every real Christian knows that the blood saves us from God's condemnation, from eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We thank God for this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But how many Christians praise the Lord for the salvation through water?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do this a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>More than forty years ago, I began to praise the Lord for salvation through the blood and for salvation through water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Thank You, Lord, that I have been saved from God's judgment and also from the evil power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hallelujah, I am out of Egypt!"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since very few Christians know that they have been delivered out of the evil age of this world, my burden is that we all must see the second aspect of God's full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's great salvation not only saves us from His judgment, but also from Satan's power.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>a. The World with All Its Ages Condemned by God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The world with all of its ages has been condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is one world with many ages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is the age of the old fashion and the age of the modern fashion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is the short-hair age, and there is the long-hair age.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the ages are condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The world of Noah's age was condemned Gen 6:11-13 , and the world of the Egyptian age also was condemned Exo 14:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The whole world is a satanic system which has systematized all of mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The world has different departments as well as different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same age you have the department of education, economics, religion, etc. Each of these is a department of the satanic system for the systematizing of man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The whole world with all of its ages and departments is under God's condemnation John 12:31; 16:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, my intention is not simply that we see God's condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should just have a look at it and then go on to God's salvation.</S>
