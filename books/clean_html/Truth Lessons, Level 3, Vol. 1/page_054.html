<h2 class="head2">D. Those Who Enjoyed the Passover<br />Continuing with the Observance<br />of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,<br />Typifying That Those Who Enjoy<br />Christ&rsquo;s Redemption and Supply Go On<br />to Live and Enjoy a Life of Purging Away Sin</h2><p>The Passover was on the fourteenth day of the first month and lasted only one day. Following this, there was the Feast of Unleavened Bread as the continuation of the Passover. The Feast of Unleavened Bread lasted for seven days (Exo. 12:15, 18), a period of completion, signifying the entire period of our Christian life, from the day of our conversion to the day of rapture. Those who enjoyed the Passover continued with the keeping of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. This typifies that those who enjoy Christ&rsquo;s redemption and supply go on to live and enjoy a life of purging away sin. In 1 Corinthians 5:8 the apostle Paul said that we must not keep the feast with old leaven, the sin of our old nature, but with unleavened bread, which is the Christ of our new nature as our nourishment and enjoyment. Only He is the life supply of sincerity and truth, absolutely pure, without mixture, and full of reality. Day by day we must enjoy such a Christ as our feast, as the rich supply of life, that we may live a life that purges away sin.</p><h2 class="head1">II. ISRAEL&rsquo;S CROSSING OF THE RED SEA<br />TYPIFYING THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; BAPTISM</h2><p>Israel&rsquo;s crossing of the Red Sea in Exodus 14 is a type of the New Testament believers&rsquo; baptism. In His creation God prepared the Red Sea to serve as a baptistry for His chosen people. Then during the exodus He led the people to this baptistry. This was according to the plan of God, which was to bring His chosen people into a situation that they might be completely delivered from the power of the world unto Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">A. The Children of Israel Being Baptized<br />unto Moses in the Cloud and in the Sea,<br />Typifying That the Believers<br />Have Been Baptized into Christ<br />in the Spirit and in the Water</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 10:1-2 Paul says, &ldquo;All our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.&rdquo; <em>In the cloud</em> signifies in the Spirit, and <em>in the sea</em> denotes in the water. Moses was a type of Christ and a representative of Christ. Hence, the children of Israel being baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea typifies that we have been baptized into Christ in the Spirit and in the water.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Water of the Red Sea<br />Drowning the Egyptian Army,<br />Typifying That the Death of Christ Has Destroyed<br />the Power of the World for the Believers</h2><p>When the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea, the Egyptian army, horses, and chariots that pursued them also went into the sea after them. The Lord confused the army of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels. Then God commanded Moses to stretch out his hand over the sea so that the waters would come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. When Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, the waters returned and covered the chariots, the horsemen, and all the army of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them (Exo. 14:22-28). This is a clear picture which shows that Satan and the power of the world have been buried and terminated in baptism. Hence, the water of the Red Sea drowning the Egyptian army typifies that the death of Christ has destroyed the power of the world for us.</p>
