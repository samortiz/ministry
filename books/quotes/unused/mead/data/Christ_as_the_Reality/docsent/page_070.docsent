   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BLOOD AROUND THE ALTAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The third point concerns the shedding of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The offering was killed on the altar by the presenter, and then the priest sprinkled the blood around the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that the altar symbolizes the cross, and the killing of the offering symbolizes the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the blood of the peace offering was not to be brought into the Holiest of All; it was to be sprinkled around the altar where the peace offering was enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It was not for God, but for the presenter, for when the presenter looked at the blood, he immediately had peace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We know that Satan, the accuser, is always busy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He never sleeps.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wherever we are, there he is, and he is even with us now.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is always accusing the hearts and minds of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes he says, "What are you doing here in this meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Don't you remember how you lost your temper this morning?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Don't you remember what you did today?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have no right to be here."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What shall we do when the accuser comes to us in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Praise the Lord for the blood!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must not only apply the blood, but also point the enemy to the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must say, "Satan, look at the blood!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You ask me to look at my failures, but I ask you to look at the blood!"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we do this, there is real peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But sometimes we are not so bold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Immediately after Satan accuses us, we pray, "O Lord, have mercy upon me and forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is this right or wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is absolutely wrong!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not pray or confess, but declare to Satan that the blood is here.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Satan, look at the blood!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You ask me to look at my failures and my sinfulness, but I demand you to look at the blood!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This really gives us peace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the blood of Christ, and the blood gives us peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We do have an altar for the shedding of the blood, and we have the sprinkling of the blood around the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How many times have you applied the blood in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am afraid that many, many times we have applied the blood in a begging way, not in a way of declaration and proclamation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, it is not necessary for us to claim; we must simply proclaim: "Satan, look at the blood!"</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Would we be so bold?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we practice this, we will have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>TWO COLUMNS OF THE PEACE OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The fourth point concerning the peace offering is that it is built upon the previous offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If he present it for a thanksgiving, then he shall present with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, soaked.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Besides the cakes, he shall present for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings" Lev 3:5; 7:12-13, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>. The peace offering is built upon two columns of the burnt offering and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The two foregoing offerings are the base of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all must realize that though there are five kinds of offerings, yet only two are the base: the burnt offering and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These two are the basic offerings upon which the following offerings are built.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to Leviticus 3:5, the peace offering must be burned upon the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not have the burnt offering, we have no place to burn the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The burnt offering is a base for burning the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then Leviticus 7:12-13 shows us that the meal offering is also necessary for presenting the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It simply means that we must first experience Christ as the burnt offering and then as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then upon these experiences we may have the experience of Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are going to offer Christ as the peace offering, we need many experiences of Christ as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more we experience Christ as the meal offering by enjoying His humanity, the more we will enjoy Him as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the experience of the peace offering is based mainly upon the burnt offering and the meal offering.</S>
