   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARRYING OUT THE LAW OF FRUIT-BEARING ACCORDING TO A SET TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Real increase is a matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As branches of the Lord, bearing fruit is also a matter of law.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The schedule is the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A vine s fruit is not an issue of the mood of the vine, and neither is it the product of a spontaneous miracle.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A vine bears fruit according to the law of its life, which is fully related to a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, an almond tree bears fruit in the spring, whereas grapes ripen in autumn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law of the almond trees and the law of the grape vine operate according to set times.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As members of the Body of Christ, our increase and propagation are also according to the law of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I hope this point will be clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot merely make a vow before the Lord and proclaim that we will bear fruit next year.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not a reliable way; the most reliable way is for us to live in Christ in reality as His branches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then the law of His life in us will enable us to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nevertheless, this does not mean that the operation of the law of life in us relieves us of all our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The effective operation of the law of life requires a certain amount of cooperation Rom 8:2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I have planted some fruit trees and other plants in the front yard of my house.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, I see that every plant flowers and bears fruit at a set time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the other hand, these times are affected by loosening the soil, watering, and adding fertilizer at set times.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Overwatering can kill a tree, and insufficient watering can hinder the growth of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life is according to law, but the growth of life requires cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When there is proper cooperation, much fruit can be borne.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, we must all learn to responsibly cooperate with the law of fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider a saint who is convinced that zealousness for the Lord involves constant participation in every activity of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From 1936 to 1938, I was living in Tiantsin, but I was also taking care of the church in Beijing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At that time there was a sister in Beijing whose husband was a professor at the university.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day she became quite stirred up for the Lord and began coming to the meeting hall every day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She would leave home in the morning with her Bible bag and not return until eleven o clock at night.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>She entrusted her children to a nanny and completely neglected her housework.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She justified her behavior by saying that anyone who stayed home did not love the Lord and that anyone who took care of their family and children before the Lord loved the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This put a great strain on her marriage, and all of the saints were concerned for her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although life grows, there must also be a proper cooperation related to the outward environment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some saints do not bear fruit because they do not go to the meetings to receive the supply, and others do not bear fruit because, even though they go to every meeting, they receive no supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sister in Beijing went to every meeting, but she did not bear any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Her willingness to ignore the needs of her home, her children, and her husband also created problems for the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Her husband was so unhappy that he said to the saints, If this is what happens when a person believes in Jesus, I will never believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Her husband thought that her behavior was the result of our teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In response, we voiced our concerns to him and exhorted the sister to stay at home more.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only then was he comforted.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a common experience among us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Either we do not do anything, or we become so zealous that we cannot stop.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Doing things by fits and starts is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not necessary to go to every meeting; in fact, some meetings are for certain groups of saints and other meetings are for a different group of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the past even though the churches scheduled many meetings during the week with the expectation that every saint would come to every meeting, only those who were fervent came to every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Others could not meet this expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When one brother, who could not attend every meeting, came to a meeting, he was asked, Why didn t you come to the prayer meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why didn t you attend the mid-week meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Faced with this kind of questioning, he made up excuses in order to not be condemned for loving the world.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This damaged his willingness to come to the meetings that he could attend by causing him to feel as if he was inadequate as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many saints in this situation eventually stop coming to the meetings and do indeed become backslidden.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must make some proper adjustments to our schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Saints who have a limited amount of time do not need to go to every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the same time, we should adjust our concept to realize that it is not abnormal if a saint can attend only one or two meetings a week.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even if a saint can come only once every two weeks or once every month, this is not bad.</S>
