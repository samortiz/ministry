   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We had our entrance through the way of righteousness; this is the way we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The result of this is that as Christians, we should learn righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We cannot be careless in anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Since God has been righteous in saving us, we do not match God and are not compatible with Him if we are not righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Redemption makes us an expression of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What redemption has taught us should be expressed as God's righteousness in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should live our life on earth as righteous ones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to remember that God could not be unrighteous in saving us; He could not be unrighteous toward Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His nature is such that He has to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He cannot perform an unrighteous act or let an unrighteous act go unpunished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Since every saved person, every Christian, is a specimen and an expression of God's righteousness, how can we do anything unrighteous?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the unique supreme God has to be righteous, how much more should we spend our days on earth in righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can learn one lesson immediately: anything unrighteous does not resemble God, any violation of others' rights does not resemble God, and any neglect of our own duty does not resemble God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must remember that for the sake of righteousness, God paid a righteous price, the price of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has sacrificed His Son for the sake of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified One, is God's righteous price.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the sake of righteousness, God paid a great price.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot be unrighteous for fear of paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For a while, it may be convenient and advantageous to compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we are an unrighteous person, we will eat the fruit of unrighteousness in the end.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, in order to advance in this way, we must first consider how we initially entered this way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In saving us, God did not bring us in through the back door; He welcomed us through the front door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thank and praise God that we were saved in a respectable way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In bringing us in in this way, God shut up every mouth; He saved us in a righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God were unrighteous in any way, the devil would have something to say, because he is forever standing on God's opposite side.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The devil would say that God saved men unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We thank the Lord that He prepared a salvation that even shuts the mouth of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God saved us in a way that no one can overturn.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First John 1:9 says, "He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God saved us according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hallelujah, this is the way we came in!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since God was not loose and unrighteous in saving us, we should not be loose in anything that we do throughout our life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have to learn the principle of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What does it mean to be righteous?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being righteous is owing others nothing; it is refusing to take what one does not deserve, and refusing to give what should not be given.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To repeat, since God is not unrighteous concerning Himself, we who belong to Him cannot be unrighteous either.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot owe anyone anything.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether or not we can be a proper Christian and grow depends on our view and feeling concerning righteousness at the time we entered the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It hurts our heart to see some so-called Christians having no sense of righteousness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They never feel that they have done anything unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some have not even apologized once to anyone since they became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Does this mean that they have always been right?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There can only be two possibilities as to why they have never apologized.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Either they have been right all the time and never been wrong, or they have been wrong and not confessed that they were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we do not deceive ourselves to think that we are never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May we not put aside confession through the hardening of our heart or the saving of our face.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>DEALING WITH UNRIGHTEOUS THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In order to learn righteousness, we have to learn to deal with all the unrighteous things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Before we became a Christian, we might have done many unrighteous things, such as taking advantage of others, deceiving others, or unconsciously taking their possessions as our own.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these are unrighteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some might even have done worse.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some have been unrighteous not only in material things, but with respect to the rights of others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Everyone has his own right.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you do not respect the rights of others, you are being unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some parents argue with each other all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>There is no peace between them all year round, and their children are deprived of the peace they deserve.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a result, the parents have trampled the rights of their children under their feet.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is being unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some husbands have not fulfilled their duty as husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some wives have not fulfilled their duty as wives.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These are also unrighteousnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now that we have become Christians, we should learn to deal with these unrighteous things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How well we run the race before us depends on how well we have learned the first lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God's redemption tells us that God has saved us in such a righteous way that we can no longer live carelessly on earth; we have to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At least we should learn this one lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once we know of any unrighteousness, we have to deal with it because all unrighteousnesses are sins.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many people only know pride, jealousy, murder, and arson as sins.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They have not seen what unrighteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God has to bring us to the point where we see unrighteouseness item by item.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we find any unrighteousness, we have to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not deal with our unrighteousness, we cannot express God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When others see us, they will not see God's righteousness and not know what God's righteousness is all about.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must let others see God's righteousness in our daily lives.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the following paragraphs we will consider how to deal with unrighteousness.</S>
