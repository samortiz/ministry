<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 2:1-2, 6-15</h1>
<p>In the messages given in recent service trainings on the history of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we considered how God&rsquo;s revelation has been confirmed among us. In other words, we viewed God&rsquo;s revelation from the perspective of history. In this section of four chapters we will consider our vision, our revelation. Revelation and vision both refer to the same thing. From God&rsquo;s perspective there is revelation, but from our perspective there is vision. When God&rsquo;s intention is revealed to us, it becomes a vision. Therefore, as we are considering God&rsquo;s revelation from the perspective of history, we are really considering our vision.</p>
<p>Revelation and vision are two sides of the same thing. Everything has two sides: an outer side and an inner side. This is also true with human beings. Human beings appear one way outwardly but are a different way inwardly. For this reason, psychologists distinguish between the metaphysical and the physical aspects of man. The outer aspect is visible, but the inner aspect is invisible. The visible aspect is very simple, but the invisible aspect is mysterious. For example, it is easy to see that a man has ears, eyes, a nose, a mouth, shoulders, arms, hands, and feet. However, even though man is simple on the outside, he is mysterious and wonderful on the inside. The most mysterious thing within man is life. It is also mysterious that man possesses more than one life. Man has a physical life, which is his biological life. Concealed within man&rsquo;s physical life is his psychological life, which the Bible calls the soul-life. This life is deeper than man&rsquo;s biological life.</p>
<p>Believers have another life that is even deeper than their physical life or their psychological life. This is the divine, eternal life that we received when we were regenerated. This life is in our spirit. Every Christian has these three lives. The first life is the biological life, the physical life of our body. The second life is the soul-life, which is our self. The third life is the deepest; it is the eternal life in our spirit. As believers, we are not simple, because we have three kinds of life.</p>
<p>In the same principle, the revelation of the Bible has one appearance on the surface, but in its depths the Bible is a mystery. It is easy to perceive the outward appearance of the Bible, but it is not easy to know the inner content. When we meet someone for the first time, we know his height and outward appearance. But there are mysteries within him. He has a spirit and a soul, and his soul consists of his mind, emotion, and will. He also has a physical heart and a psychological heart. A believer is not simple, for he has three kinds of life. Likewise, the Bible has an outward appearance and an inner content. Its appearance is easy to read. The first sentence of the Bible says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (Gen. 1:1). Even an elementary-school student can read and understand this. However, this is only the surface of the Bible. Before reading the Bible, we did not know the origin of the heavens and the earth. But after reading the Bible, we are clear that God created the heavens and the earth. This is a revelation, but it is revelation on the surface. The superficial revelation is consistent from the beginning to the end of the Bible. We will now consider the main idea of the revelation on the surface of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION ON THE SURFACE OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly says that God is the source of all things. In the beginning God created the heavens, the earth, and man. The heavens, the earth, and man are the most important items in creation. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. God created a beautiful universe. However, there is a rebel, Satan, the devil, in the universe. Satan rebelled against God and seduced man to sin against God. As a result, the man, whom God created good, became fallen and was spoiled and corrupted to become evil and dark. God, however, did not forsake man. Because God loves and delights in man, He had a plan to save man. Before saving man, however, God gave the law. The law was written according to God in order to expose man&rsquo;s fallen condition. It is through the law that man knows sin and himself, and it is through the law that man also comes under God&rsquo;s compassion to seek God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>At the appointed time, which was about four thousand years after man was created, God sent His only begotten Son to become a man, who is called Jesus. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and tasted the sufferings and hardships of human life. After thirty-three and a half years He bore the sins of the world and was judged by God on the cross, where He shed His precious blood to redeem man. On the cross He also destroyed the devil. After His death on the cross He was buried, and on the third day He was raised from the dead. His being raised from the dead proves that He is the Lord of resurrection. He remained on the earth for forty days in order to be among the disciples, after which He ascended. Ten days later the Holy Spirit was poured out, and His disciples went to preach the gospel everywhere, bringing many sinners to repentance and salvation. Because salvation was complete and the Holy Spirit had descended, every sinner could hear the gospel and be moved to repent, believe, and receive salvation. When sinners believe in the Lord Jesus and call upon His name, their sins are immediately forgiven, and they are justified and regenerated by God. These believers remain on the earth to be the church in order to do God&rsquo;s will revealed in the Bible, thus pleasing and glorifying God.</p>
<p>One day the ascended Lord will rapture the overcoming believers to heaven. Then He will return to the earth with them in order to judge this world, terminate all the corruption in the world, and establish His kingdom&mdash;the millennial kingdom&mdash;for a thousand years. After the millennial kingdom of one thousand years God will deal with Satan, the old creation will pass away, and the new heaven and the new earth will be brought in. In the new heaven and the new earth God will be with His redeemed people forever, and man will enjoy eternal blessing. This is the revelation on the surface of the sixty-six books of the Bible. This is what every Christian believes. This is also what every messenger of the gospel has preached for the past two thousand years.</p>
<p>The revelation on the surface of the Bible is taught in seminaries and preached by most preachers. Everything that is taught among Christians is included in this revelation. Hence, most Christians believe that the Bible reveals only this much. However, this is only the surface of the content of the Bible. It is not the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
