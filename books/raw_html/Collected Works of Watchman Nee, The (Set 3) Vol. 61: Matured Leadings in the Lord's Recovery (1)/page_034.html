<h2 class="head1">HOW TO HAND OURSELVES OVER</h2><p>How do we forsake everything? How do we hand ourselves over? In the Gospels we only see individuals forsaking everything. They sold their all and gave it to the poor; they did not give it to the church. This is because, in a strict sense, the church had not been established. In Acts the church was formed as a result of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. At this time the forsaking of all things became related to the church. At Pentecost there was a proper arrangement for everything that had been handed over to the church. The disciples sold their fields and possessions, and placed the proceeds at the feet of the apostles. The apostles then disposed of them and distributed them to everyone according to need (2:45). The church became involved. It was not a random selling; everything was done for the good of the church.</p><p>The church has to be bold to speak, and it has to be bold to act. The apostolic churches did not teach about selling one's all. The disciples acted this way spontaneously. The result of this giving was a great revival. This pattern is recorded in the Bible. The church should now be bold to preach this, but it must back up this preaching with the proper arrangements. When the brothers and sisters hand themselves over, they should do so in coordination with the church. They should not follow the examples in the Gospels. It should not be a random and haphazard giving. Rather, the handing over should be done with much arrangement. Some have handed over their factory or business to the church, but the church cannot conduct business or run a factory. Therefore, under the church's direction, some businesses are returned to your hand. You must manage these businesses yourself, but you should feel that the boss has changed. The Lord through the church is now your boss, and you should not take any profit for your own use anymore.</p><p>When we see the brothers and sisters hungry and lacking food, we have to take care of their needs more urgently than we take care of our business. If the brothers and sisters do not have daily necessities such as towels or toothbrushes at home, would we have the audacity to keep many of these items at home or, worse still, to display other useless objects around our house? The best thing for us to do is to ask the responsible brothers to come to our house and see if there are things that need to be given to the needy saints or see if there are things that need to be sold for the poor saints. Some brothers say that they have very little, but they are not the ones to judge whether they have much or little. Leave it to the church to decide this. We would rather overdo than not be enough. Even if we offer an item to the church and the church returns it to us, we will have the feeling that the item has been consecrated.</p><p>This kind of handing ourselves over will give us a "joy of poverty." It will give us a joy that we have never tasted before, the joy of "not having." Many have tasted the joy of "having," but when we hand everything over, we will taste the joy of "not having." It will be the same joy as the joy of "not having" sin. I hope that the brothers and sisters will all take this way.</p><p>If sin does not go away, the gospel will not go out, and if money does not go away, the gospel will not go out either. Mammon must first go away before the gospel can go out. The going away of mammon is only a way for our love to go out. It is not easy for me to ask someone to consecrate his heart. It is, in fact, impossible to exhort anyone to just consecrate his heart. The heart can be offered up, but it can be taken back in an instant. Our heart is at our own disposal. It is not easy to tell a person to "love the Lord your God from your whole heart and with your whole soul and with your whole strength and with your whole mind" (Luke 10:27). We are here to urge ourselves to send away our mammon. When we do this, our heart spontaneously will go where our mammon is. Once we hand over everything, our heart will go out with it. If we do not first send our mammon to the kingdom, it will be hard for us to enter the kingdom. Luke 18:24 shows us that it is difficult for those who have riches to enter the kingdom. The Lord told the young ruler to send away his mammon. If he had sent his mammon away to heaven, he would have entered the kingdom spontaneously.</p>
