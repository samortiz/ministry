   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Problem of Material Possessions</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The last case dealt with by Paul in 1 Corinthians is the case of giving and receiving material possessions 16:1-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The matter of giving and receiving material things is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our Christian life and church service must be filled with giving and receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not store up for ourselves all the things we receive from God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, we must give to others, passing on what we have and caring for others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we are not this kind of believer, we are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If with regard to material possessions we are defeated, we are not spiritual believers but fleshly or soulish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Lord would give us a certain amount of money, we should give to others to take care of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even giving and receiving is a matter of the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In dealing with material possessions, we must learn to pray, seek the Lord's guidance, and take care of the situation in the Body and of the saints' needs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must be concerned for the Lord's children and His Body to the extent that if we receive a certain amount of money, we would give some to others and then spend the rest, not for ourselves but for the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to verse 2, we should offer our gifts on the first day of the week.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the eighth day, which signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That we make our offering on the day of resurrection indicates that our giving should be done in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not offer in an old way but in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not offer in the principle of the seventh day, which represents the old creation, but in the principle of the first day, which symbolizes the newness of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if we give something on the Lord's Day, in the sight of God it still may not be in the principle of the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It may be something of the first day of the old week, in waste, emptiness, and darkness Gen 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There may be no life or light in that giving.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to add "honey" to our offerings, which is the sweetness of the flesh and of our old nature in our friendliness with others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must offer whatever the Lord gives as a surplus in material things in the way of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The flesh and the old creation must be thoroughly dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes we may pass on good things to our intimate relatives in order to meet a particular need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although this may be according to the guidance of the Lord, there may be no imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, we should be willing to give our surplus to the co-workers, to the Lord's servants, and to the Lord's people with whom we have no relationship in the flesh, but with whom there is a real relationship in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We give to others not because we love them in a natural way or out of a friendship or relationship, but because of the Lord's burden, interest, and work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We give not in the old creation but in the new creation, not on the seventh day but on the eighth day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In principle, we give on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here again, even in the matter of giving and receiving, our self must be dealt with by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must give all the ground to Christ and give all the praise to Him as our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then our giving will be done in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Of course, literally speaking, the Christians in the ancient time came together on the Lord's Day to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the literal meaning of the Lord's Day, but there is a spiritual meaning as well, which is that we do nothing in the way of old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the foregoing eleven cases, there are spiritual persons, soulish persons, fleshly persons, and fleshy persons.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can apply these four conditions to all the persons in this book.</S>
