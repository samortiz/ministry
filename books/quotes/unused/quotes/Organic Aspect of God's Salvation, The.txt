We thank You from our depths that in Your recovery You have never stopped speaking to us; You have been speaking to us again and again
Lord, we believe that this time You will still speak to us a word concerning Your salvation from another angle
May You be one spirit with us here to speak with us, to speak in our speaking, and even to make our speaking Your speaking
By the word judicial we know it has something to do with the law, and by the word organic we know it has something to do with life
God's complete salvation has both the judicial aspect, an aspect related to the law, and the organic aspect, an aspect related to life
We all know that God so loved the people of the world that He gave His only begotten Son to them that they may have eternal life
God gave His only begotten Son to the people of the world that they may receive eternal life by believing into Him and receiving Him
In eternity God had a good pleasure, His heart's desire, to be one with man, even to make man the same as He to be His species
In the creation of man He created man in His image and after His likeness for man to become a vessel to contain Him
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
God's righteousness is strict; whatever God wants to do for man must meet the requirement of His righteousness
The Bible shows us that after God's creation of man and man's fall, after a period of time, God came to give man the law
By redeeming the sinners judicially, God may freely do as He pleases by His life organically according to His heart's desire
God's complete salvation comprises the redemption required judicially and the salvation accomplished through God's life organically
God was willing to allow the highest angel created by Him to rebel against Him with a group of angels and be His opposer
In this way Satan has become 'the opposition party' in the universe particularly to watch over God and oppose God
In the complete salvation of God what He does in the judicial aspect is the procedure and what He does in the organic aspect is the purpose
If you have received only these five items of redemption, what you have received is but a one-sided salvation and not the complete salvation
We need to be clear that the complete salvation of God is of two aspects: the judicial aspect and the organic aspect
Redemption as the judicial aspect cannot carry out the purpose of God's salvation, because it is merely the procedure, not the purpose
We pray that You would again give us utterance, fresh utterance, instant utterance, utterance that can meet Your need today
We pray that You would cause those of us who speak to be able to speak and those of us who listen to be able to listen
May Your Spirit of grace anoint us today, anoint this meeting, anoint every attendant, and anoint every move and action
Lord, draw the boundary around us by Your prevailing blood and do not allow Your enemy to cross over one step to distract or disturb us
In the previous message we saw that God's complete salvation is of two aspects: the judicial aspect and the organic aspect
In the Old Testament, the most evident illustration is the keeping of the Feast of the Passover by the children of Israel
Now God sent Moses to lead them out of Egypt, but there were two problems with them that made it difficult for them to get out
Once the lamb was killed, it was divided into two parts, one part being the blood and the other part, the flesh
The children of Israel did according to God's word, so when the destroyer came to their houses, he passed over them
They had to eat it with their loins girded, their shoes on their feet, and their staff in their hand; they also had to eat it in haste
After they sprinkled the blood of the lamb, the children of Israel also needed to eat the flesh of the lamb hastily
Every household had to eat the flesh of the lamb until they were full that they might be ready to take the journey ahead
The Passover in the Old Testament shows us that God's salvation has the redeeming aspect and the saving aspect
Afterward, his father immediately ordered the slaves, saying, 'Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him'
That robe was known to all the household because it had been prepared earlier by the father to be put on his son upon his return
Perhaps the son was ashamed to say it, but the father went on to say, 'Bring the fattened calf; slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry'
The robe signifies the judicial aspect of God's salvation, and the calf signifies the organic aspect of God's salvation
In the type of the Passover in the Old Testament, the children of Israel sprinkled the blood of the lamb and ate the flesh of the lamb
To drink the blood is judicial for redemption; to eat the flesh is organic for the move after receiving redemption
When we eat the bread and drink the cup, this signifies that we eat the Lord's flesh and drink the Lord's blood
John 316 says For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that every one who believes into Him would have eternal life
The Lord Jesus died for us on the cross as a serpent and dealt with Satan that we may receive God as our eternal life
If we are sure concerning the aforementioned items, it is simply not possible to say that we have not been regenerated
To be regenerated and thereby receive God as our eternal life is the first item of the organic salvation of God's complete salvation
Following this, we have shepherding, dispositional sanctification, renewing, transformation, building up, conformation, and glorification
We should not despise the five items on the judicial side, and even more we should not despise the eight items on the organic side
In this message we want to see the matters of regeneration and shepherding in the organic aspect of God's salvation
The Lord went on to say, 'That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit'
When we are born of Him, we are born of the Spirit and eventually, we are spirit, the second spirit referred to in John 3:6
Peter 1:23 says, 'Having been regenerated not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
We may say that regeneration is the center of God's complete salvation and the commencement of God's salvation in its organic aspect
Before we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were so confused about everything that we even did not know what being a man was all about
By seeing that we have God in us, we can give up what we loved and what we were not able to give up in the past
We have been made alive in our spirit by the Spirit of God; He has put His genes in us that we may have His life and nature
The cat life has its taste, the dog life has its taste, and so does the horse life, the cow life, the goat life, etc
All our taste comes from our five sensesthe sense of sight the sense of hearing the sense of smell the sense of taste and the sense of touch
On Sundays a few of us would play soccer from seven or eight o'clock in the morning until six or seven o'clock in the evening
That afternoon she preached a message concerning how Satan, like the Pharaoh of Egypt, detains people in his system
Finally, this renewing enables us to get rid of all that is of our natural life and the old creation and become God's new creation
After the believers are regenerated and receive God as their eternal life, they still need to receive the shepherding in God's life
Shepherding includes feeding, as the nursing mother feeds the baby for the baby to grow, as mentioned in 1 Peter 2:2
In Song of Songs the Lord instructs His lover to go forth on the footsteps of His flock and be at the place where He pastures His sheep
In the previous two messages we referred to the two aspects of God's complete salvation, the judicial aspect and the organic aspect
Of all, we want to see that the contents of the New Testament are God's work in both the judicial aspect and the organic aspect
Following Acts, the twenty-two Epistles cover particularly the church, the Body of Christ, and the New Jerusalem
They consider that it is more important to speak in tongues and that a person cannot be saved without speaking in tongues
The former belongs to the judicial aspect of God's salvation, whereas the latter belongs to the organic aspect of God's salvation
As mentioned in Matthew 23 when the gold is placed in the market it is something common but when it is placed in the temple it is sanctified
Immediately after we were saved, we simply did not want to mingle with those in the world; we had been separated from them
Some fashionable people did not like hats with a broad brim, so they secretly made their hat with a narrower brim
Eventually, some of them kept two kinds of hats in their home, one with a broad brim and another with a narrow brim
When the pastor came, they wore the one with a broad brim, and after the pastor left, they put on the one with a narrow brim
After regeneration we pass through shepherding, and then we have the dispositional sanctification, which is a matter in the nature of God
When we are saved, the element of God's holy nature comes into us; this holy nature begins to work in us to sanctify us dispositionally
Romans 12:2a says, 'Do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
In contrast, the renewing taught by the Scriptures is the renewing of the mind; it is altogether a matter related to the mind
The mind is our mentality, our philosophy, our religious concepts, our views concerning people and things, etc
The spirit of our mind is the regenerated spirit mingled with the Spirit of God spreading into our mind to exercise control over it
By regeneration we have the life of God, by sanctification we partake of the nature of God, and by renewing we have a change in our mind
The sisters should not, on the one hand, speak about loving the Lord, and on the other hand, apply lipstick heavily
The washing of regeneration washes away our old life; following this, the renewing of the Holy Spirit changes our mind
We all know that the Lord Jesus as the eternal God is from eternity to eternity, yet with Him there is an aspect of three stages
In eternity past, He was merely the only begotten Son of God, who is the same as God and is the Second in the Divine Trinity
In His judgment, He spoke a prophecy with a promise, that is, that the seed of woman would bruise the serpent's head
Suddenly they heard that the seed of woman would come and would bruise the head of the serpent, so they were very excited
While the bruising of the serpent's head by the seed of woman was to deal with Satan, man still had the problem of sin before God
For this reason, God killed a sacrifice and made coats with the skin of the sacrifice for Adam and Eve to put on
After four thousand years, that is, two thousand years ago, He came not only from eternity into time but also with divinity into humanity
Genesis 6:3 says, 'And Jehovah said, My Spirit shall not strive with man for ever, for that he also is flesh '
Since man had become flesh and God would have nothing to do with the flesh, the Holy Spirit would no longer have any contact with man
The first stage is in eternity, and the second stage is in the flesh until He was on the cross, saying, 'It is finished'!
What He did in His living of thirty-three and a half years was to accomplish the judicial aspect of God's salvation
He did nothing according to His own will; everything He did was in subjection to the Father through the end when He went to die on the cross
Eventually, He went to the cross, and there He cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me'?
God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners -He bore our sins and was made sin for us
At the very moment that the Lord Jesus died on the cross, blood flowed forth, and with the blood, water also flowed forth
Blood is for the judicial aspect of God's salvation, whereas water is for the organic aspect of God's salvation
Spirit begets spirit' means that God is Spirit and we have to be born of Him in our spirit that we may be regenerated
God's salvation in its judicial aspect required only thirty-three and a half years for its accomplishment, but the organic aspect is endless
The Lord Jesus needs eternity to accomplish His organic work, and the apostles needed twenty-two books to define it
In the preceding messages we saw God's organic salvation in regeneration, shepherding, dispositional sanctification, and renewing
Transformation is not an outward change or correction but the metabolic function of the life of God in the believers
Transformation is not to make some corrections from without; it is the function of metabolism from within and is manifested without
Luke 15 tells us that when the prodigal son returned home, he had a robe put on him for his covering, yet he still appeared thin and sickly
Their inward disposition will be transformed, and their outward image will also be transformed to be the same as the image of the Lord
In this way we are being transformed into the same image as the Lord from one level of glory to another level of glory for His expression
When this bountiful supply comes into us, it begins the inner process of metabolism and issues in an outward manifestation
We can ask Him about everything, without any need to use the telephone or the fax machine, for He can talk with us right within us
The Lords Word says In nothing be anxious but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God
The Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is in us not to trouble us but to be our Paraclete, Comforter, Supporter
Eventually, transformation requires the believers' outer man to be decaying that their inner man may be renewed day by day
When several people serve in coordination, there is always someone who has a tough personality that is unbearable
The Lord arranges this kind of situation that our outer man may be decaying so that our inner man may be renewed
The building up of the Body of Christ mentioned in the New Testament is the building up by being joined and knit together in the divine life
Concerning God's building on earth today, the New Testament contains sufficient revelation, teaching, instruction, and warning
In chapter two He declared that this house of God is built by Him in resurrection with His resurrection life and power
Ephesians, a book specifically on the church as the Body of Christ, stresses particularly the building up of the Body
No doubt, this is the building as the issue of the coordination of the God-chosen and transformed believers with the processed Triune God
After we have been sanctified, our former peculiar and strange disposition is changed and becomes proper, matching God's nature
On the other hand, transformation is the outward manifestation as the issue of the metabolism in life within us
If you feel that you have matured very much a month after you hear this message, it shows that you are not mature
In the previous messages we covered regeneration, shepherding, sanctification, renewing, transformation, and building up
We need to be sanctified in our disposition by allowing God to change our peculiar being with His holy nature as the element
The man created by God was upright, honest, and not crooked, but after the fall, man became deceitful, dishonest, and strange
Among us there are many couples who have been married for many years, but are there a husband and wife who have never lied to each other?
There are at least three portions in the Scriptures that refer to both the Spirit of God and the spirit of man
Augustine said that if you try to comprehend the Triune God, it is like using a small ladle to measure the ocean
God's predestinating us to be conformed to the image of His Son is for His Son to be the Firstborn among His many sons
Concerning the Son of God, there is a very difficult question in theology, that is: How many sons does God have?
James 1:18 says that God 'brought us forth by the word of truth, purposing that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures'
God's only begotten Son has divinity but not humanity, whereas God's firstborn Son has both divinity and humanity
The mingling of humanity with divinity produced the second status of the Son of God, that is, the firstborn Son of God
There are two accordings here according to the flesh He is the seed of David a man according to the Spirit of holiness He is the Son of God
He was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead
In John 12:24 the Lord said that He was the grain of wheat which bears much fruit by falling into the ground and dying
Peter 1:3 says that at the time of Christ's resurrection, that is, in His resurrection, God regenerated all of us
You should not think that you have been regenerated for two months, or that you have been regenerated for sixty-seven years
Why is it that after we were regenerated to become the sons of God, we still have to be conformed to the image of God's firstborn Son?
Perhaps this morning some of you husbands and wives still had a quarrel, and after the quarreling you came to the meeting
In the United States today about one hundred twenty million, which is half of the population, are Protestants and Catholics
When we all live out His image, the world will see Christ as the Firstborn of God because all His brothers will be manifested here
To know how to be conformed to the image of God's Firstborn, we must understand how God's Firstborn lived on earth
In the four Gospels, from beginning to end, the Lord called Himself the Son of Man ; He lived as a man on earth
Eventually, according to God's requirement of righteousness judicially, He was qualified to go to the cross to bear our sins and die for us
His death was altogether a judicial matter for the accomplishment of God's requirement of righteousness judicially
The crucified life which He lived on earth as the Son of Man became a mold; we should be conformed to such a mold
According to the flesh, we are sons of Adam; we may also say that according to the Spirit of holiness, we are sons of God
If we want to experience being conformed to the image of God's Son, we need to be daily conformed to His death
Glorification is the spreading forth of Christ's glory from the believers by their growing to maturity in Christ's life
God's organic work is from regeneration to glorification, from God's entering into man to man's practically being brought into God
On the other hand, organically, the church of God is constituted with the God-regenerated people in the divine life
The believers' ultimate transfiguration in their body to enter into God's glory is the redemption of their body
Our being raptured and transfigured to enter into glory is an organic matter, but our body still needs to be redeemed
