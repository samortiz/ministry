   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECOVERING THE CHURCH LIFE AS THE ISSUE OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today the Lord is recovering the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We all have to realize what the church life is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church life is the issue of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot have a proper church life merely by teaching or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the past four or five centuries all kinds of teachings have been recovered, applied, and tested.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The result has been division after division.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All divisions come from different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever there is a great teacher, the result may be a division.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Today's Christianity has been divided mainly by two things teachings and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Today people pay attention to the charismatic things, the gifts, but many of those who emphasize the gifts are the most divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The charismatic groups have been divided again and again into division after division.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I was in the charismatic movement for a period of time, and I received power and gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The real power, however, is life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gifts and life can be compared to a thunderstorm and small flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A powerful thunderstorm can blow through a city, but eventually it goes away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Flowers and grass, however, continue to live and grow day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church life does not need thunderstorm power; it needs life power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord's intention today is to have the recovery of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church life is a life in which day by day all the members feed on Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ came as food to be taken in by His people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all have to eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whoever takes Christ as food is a part of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the members of the Body of Christ should be the eaters of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can be a part of Jesus only by eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because we eat Jesus, we become Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are members of Jesus by eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1966 the Lord gave us pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By pray-reading, many hundreds of saints have been brought into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The more we pray-read, the more we are brought into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If a few brothers come together only to recite and study John 1:1, after a short time they will fight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If they do not fight, they will at least be unhappy with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if these same brothers come together and pray-read, there will a different result.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I say, "Hallelujah, in the beginning!", you say, "Amen!", and two brothers say, "Was the Word!" after only ten minutes we will shout, "Oh, the sweetness!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Oh, the oneness!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, the Spirit!"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the beginning to the end, the Bible is a matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is the tree of life in Genesis 2, the manna in the wilderness, and the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then of the four Gospels, the Gospel of John especially reveals eating.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord tells us that He is the bread of life for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, in the last chapter of Revelation, there is no power, knowledge, or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is only a throne, from which a river flows, and on either side of the river is the tree of life 22:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city" v. 14 . The eating of the tree of life is for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need power, but this is not something for the normal daily life of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church is God's cultivated land 1 Cor 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The church is a harvest, a crop.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because the church is a crop, Paul says, "I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth" v. 6 . This planting, watering, and growing are all things related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Never forget that the church is a cultivated land, a harvest, and that all the members of the church need the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can grow only by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is no other way to grow.</S>
