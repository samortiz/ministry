   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Tonight I will speak a few frank and serious words.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No two brothers or two sisters who are at odds with each other can appear in the kingdom together.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the coming kingdom, there will only be love and mercy; only those who love and show mercy to one another can be in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If I am involved in an argument with a brother, and if the matter is not dealt with in this age, then in the future, either both of us will be barred from the kingdom, or only one of us will get in. It cannot be that both of us will enter in. It is not possible for us to have a problem with each other and yet reign at the same time in the millennium in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the kingdom all the believers are in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are absolutely no barriers between any two persons.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If while we are on earth today, we have some friction with any brother or sister, or if we cause a hindrance to any brother or sister, we have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Either we will go in and the other will be excluded, or the other will go in and we will be excluded, or both will be excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord says that while you are with him on the way you have to be reconciled to him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That means that while you and he are alive and before the Lord Jesus comes back, you have to be reconciled to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus will not tolerate two enemies complaining about each other in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today we may harbor complaints about others very easily; but these complaints will either keep us outside, keep others outside, or keep both us and others outside the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It seems that the church today is very free, but it will not be like this in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"While you are with him on the way," says the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you die, or if he dies, or if the Lord Jesus returns, the way is ended.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, you have to settle the matter quickly before the Lord comes back and while both he and you are on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Lest the opponent deliver you to the judge."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The judge is the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"And the judge to the officer."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The officer is the angel.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And you be thrown into prison."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows us clearly that a brother who has offended another brother will suffer very severe punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you study this passage carefully, you will see that the prison here is the Gehenna of fire in verse 22, because verse 23 begins with "therefore."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The words from verse 23 on are an explanation of the words in verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 22 says that anyone who calls his brother Moreh will be liable to the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verses 23-25 follow by saying that those who are not reconciled to their brothers will be put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, the prison in verse 25 is very clearly the Gehenna of fire in verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are clear that there is no possibility for a Christian to perish eternally, but if a Christian has any unrepented of and unconfessed sins, which are not forgiven, he will suffer the Gehenna of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Notice the severity of the words of the Lord in verse 26: "Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is the possibility to come out if one has paid off everything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the coming age, there is still the possibility of forgiveness, but one cannot come out until he pays the last quadrans and clears up everything with his brother.</S>
