   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CONCERNING CHRIST'S SECOND COMING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the period before the Reformation, the Catholic Church paid little attention to the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the Reformation, the Christians in the Protestant churches began to pay attention to the prophecies concerning this matter and brought them out one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the early apostles passed away, the church on earth had great problems, especially in arguments related to the expounding of the Bible, so that eventually the church was divided into two parts, the Eastern church and the Western church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consequently, in A.D. 325 Emperor Constantine of Rome called a council at Nicea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the Christian leaders assembled together and formulated the Nicene Creed, which temporarily settled all their arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then, after another two hundred years, in A.D. 590, the papal system was formally established and was universally recognized by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This became the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Under the rule of the Catholic Church, the church passed through a period called the Dark Ages for ten centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then in 1517 Martin Luther took the lead to reform the church, and he translated the Bible into German, thus opening up the biblical truths.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After this many Protestant groups were formed, and different items of the truth were gradually released.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, the truth concerning the Lord's second coming remained vague.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then in 1828 the brothers in England were raised up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were enlightened by the Lord concerning the truth, and there was a great advancement in the knowledge of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In a general way, under their hand the prophecies concerning the Lord's second coming were crystalized.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In particular, J. N. Darby made the greatest contribution.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, the logic in his line of thought was somewhat deficient, and the details regarding the Lord's second coming were not made sufficiently clear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later, the Lord raised up G. H. Pember, who was well versed in biblical prophecy, especially in the history of the prophecies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He wrote four books concerning the prophecies of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One of them, entitled The Great Prophecies, covers the prophecies concerning the Jews, the Gentiles, and the church; the other three also cover the prophecies concerning the Jews, the Gentiles, and the church, respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These four books may be considered the foundation of the study of biblical prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone who pursues the knowledge of the prophecies in the Bible is helped by these four books.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Pember was well versed in the history of the biblical prophecies, and his study in this matter was excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, concerning the vision of the struggle between the ram and the he-goat in Daniel 8, Pember realized that the he-goat signifies the Grecian Empire, and the ram, the Persian Empire, because the symbol of ancient Greece was the goat, and the symbol of Persia was the ram.</S>
