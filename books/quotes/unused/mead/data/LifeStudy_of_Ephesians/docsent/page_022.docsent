   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. God s Abundant Grace</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having Accomplished Redemption for Us</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and Applied Forgiveness to Us</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s abundant grace has accomplished redemption for us and has applied forgiveness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ, redemption has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After ascending into the heavens and receiving repentance and forgiveness, He now applies forgiveness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is according to the riches of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Redemption and Forgiveness</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Being according to God s Righteousness,</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>but Accomplished and Applied</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>by God s Rich Grace</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both redemption and forgiveness are according to God s righteousness, but they are accomplished and applied by God s rich grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that both God s righteousness, which is God s way of doing things, and grace, which is God Himself dispensed into His chosen people, have been exercised to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>GOD S GRACE BEING MADE TO ABOUND TO US</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 1:8 says that God s grace has been caused to abound to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s grace is not only rich, but also abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians know about amazing grace, but not about abounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It takes revelation to know God s abounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His abounding grace has made us an inheritance to God v. 11 and has qualified us to inherit all that God is v. 14 . In other words, this abounding grace makes us God s inheritance on the one hand and makes God our inheritance on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is something far greater than sinners merely being saved and going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This concept, the concept of being saved for heaven, is rather natural.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to see the abounding grace that makes us an inheritance to God and qualifies us to inherit all that God is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>IN ALL WISDOM AND PRUDENCE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 8 says that the riches of God s grace have been caused to abound to us in all wisdom and prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Wisdom is what is within God to plan and purpose a will concerning us; prudence is the application of God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God firstly planned and purposed in His wisdom, and then He applied what He had planned and purposed for us with prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Wisdom was mainly related to God s plan in eternity, and prudence is mainly related to God s execution of His plan in time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What God planned in eternity in His wisdom, He is now executing in time in His prudence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In God s prudence He has brought us to Himself and into His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, through the exercise of His prudence, He is applying to us all that He planned in eternity regarding us.</S>
