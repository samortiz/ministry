	 <h2 class="head2">The Children Becoming the Gospel Seeds<br />
in Their Schools</h2>
<p>God ordained that man be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth (Gen. 1:28). Thus, man has multiplied, but how do we raise our children? Many years ago we did not know that children could be a great potential for the gospel. We stressed preaching the gospel but neglected the fact that children could also be the fruit of the gospel. When we realized that children could also be considered fruit of the gospel, I fellowshipped with the brothers, asking them to work with the goal of having ten thousand children in Taipei. If we had carried this out at that time and contacted ten thousand children, a majority of them would be older brothers and sisters today. We cannot guarantee that every child would have been saved, but at least eighty percent of the children would have been saved. This would equal eight thousand children. In addition, the ten thousand children was not a fixed number. Every year new children would have been added to us.</p>
<p>When children are saved, they become our young brothers and sisters. After they graduate from primary school, they become seeds of the gospel in junior high school. When we work in the schools, they become our inside helpers and bring their classmates to us. In this way, it is easier to work in the junior high schools. It is difficult to bring the gospel to a school where there are no saints who are teachers or students. However, young brothers and sisters in a junior high school can be likened to little seeds; they are waiting to sprout by responding to our call and bringing their classmates to salvation. When they enter into high school, they again become seeds of the gospel. During their three years of high school, we could bring three times as many people to salvation. When these young saints finish high school and enter college, they are seeds of the gospel in their college. In this way the number of people saved is continually multiplied. This is truly a great thing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Spiritual Cultivation in the Church</h2>
<p>Suppose these children begin to be cultivated in the children&rsquo;s meetings at the age of six and are saved. They will continue to be cultivated through three years of junior high school, three years of high school, and four years of college. In all, they will receive a total of sixteen years of spiritual education and cultivation. While they will receive sixteen years of secular education, they will also receive sixteen years of spiritual cultivation in the church. How valuable this is!</p>
<p>After graduating from college, this group of young brothers and sisters should not hurry to look for a job. Instead, they should stay in the church and receive two years of full-time training. During the training, they will spend half their time learning the truth and pursuing the growth of life and the other half of their time learning to serve in coordination in the church. After two years they will know whether the Lord is leading them to serve full time for the rest of their lives. It may be that one-tenth of them will continue and serve full time, and the rest will get a job. No matter what they do, these saints will have received sixteen years of spiritual education together with two years of full-time training. When they enter society, they will be different from other people. Such a cultivation is valuable. It is not only a great help to the Lord&rsquo;s work but also beneficial to society, people, and the country.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Families Being Brought In through the Children</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the children&rsquo;s work has an additional function, which is to gain the families of the children. Children like to make friends. It is particularly easy for children between the ages of six and twelve to make friends, and they listen to their friends. It is therefore easy for a child to lead another child. When the children sing hymns together, the gospel is operating and spreads from one child to another child. Our purpose, however, is not focused only on the children, but even more, through the children, we want to reach their parents and siblings.</p>
<p>The first thing that the Western missionaries who preached the gospel in China did was to establish schools. Since the people were ignorant and illiterate, the Western missionaries had to educate them before the gospel could be preached widely. There was no school system established in China, and many towns and villages still had the traditional private tutoring. Many people did not like to hear the gospel, but because they wanted their children to be educated, they sent their children to Christian schools. The Chinese have a saying: &ldquo;He who is near vermilion becomes red, and he who is near ink becomes black.&rdquo; It was impossible for the children who studied in the Christian schools not to hear the gospel, because the schools stipulated that everyone participate in the service on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. On the surface this did not seem to have any effect, but no one can say for certain that there was no effect. Everything depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>A brother once testified that he believed into Jesus because a person who did not believe in Jesus said, &ldquo;It is very good to believe in Jesus.&rdquo; This proves that our Lord is real and living. As long as God&rsquo;s name is mentioned and His gospel is preached, someone will be saved. Hence, we should not despise what the Western missionaries did in China. Although not many were saved through the schools, some were saved. It is likely that some did not get saved while they were in school, but after leaving school, they recalled the gospel that they heard while they were in school and were saved. The Western missionaries put much effort into establishing schools not only to educate people but ultimately to preach the gospel to them. Our children&rsquo;s meetings should have the same function; they should gain many unbelieving families.</p>
<p>The Catholic approach is very effective. A Catholic must obtain the approval of a priest to marry a non-Catholic. The priest then gives his approval with the condition that the couple gives their children to the Catholic Church. Hence, before the children are even born, they are members of the Catholic Church. This method is effective. Sometimes we do not care about people. We think that one or two persons do not make a difference. However, there is the saying that many buckets of water make a river. We should know this principle. If we do not care about any drop of water, eventually, no river will be formed. Therefore, we should care for the children. Then as the children grow, they will learn to lead others to salvation, and they will become seeds of the gospel. From this we can see the importance of the children&rsquo;s work. The children&rsquo;s work is greatly related to the growth of the church. May we not take this matter lightly.</p>
