   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HEALTHY PRACTICES IN THE CHURCH LIFE Praying</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:13 James goes on to the matter of healthy practices in the church life: Does anyone among you suffer evil?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let him pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is anyone cheerful?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let him sing praise.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Praying brings us the strength of the Lord to endure suffering, and singing praise keeps us in the joy of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek words rendered sing praise also mean sing psalms, or play on a stringed instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether we pray or sing praise, we should contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In any environment and under any circumstance, humble or exalted, grievous or joyful, we need to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 14 James continues, Is anyone among you weak?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let him call to him the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, having anointed him with oil in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this verse James refers to someone who is weak because of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Weakness leads to sickness 1 Cor 11:30 , and sickness causes more weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 14 James encourages the one who is weak to call the elders of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To call the elders of the church to pray for weakness due to sickness implies that there is no problem between the calling one and the church represented by the elders; that restitution has been made between the calling one and the church, if the sickness is due to the calling one s having offended the church see 1 Cor 11:29-32 ; and that there has been a thorough confession of sins one to another by the sick one and the elders James 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anointing with Oil in the Name of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In verse 14 James speaks of anointing with oil in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Two Greek words are translated anoint: aleipho, the word used here and in John 12:3, is the common term for applying oil: chrio means to anoint officially for office as priest Acts 10:38 , king Heb 1:9 , or prophet Luke 4:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chrio in connection with Christos Christ is used for the anointing of the Son by the Father Acts 10:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To anoint with oil signifies to impart the Spirit of life, who has been poured upon the Body of Christ as the anointing oil Psa 133:2 , to the sick member of the Body, through the representation of the elders of the church, for the healing of the sick one 1 John 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the name of the Lord signifies oneness with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The anointing in 5:14 is not by elders alone, but by their being one with the Lord, representing both the Body and the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 14 we have the only direct mention of the church in the book of James.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The one time James speaks of the church is in reference to the negative matter of healing sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, the matter of turning back a brother who has been led astray from the truth is also a matter related to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, what James says concerning the church involves negative matters, praying for the sick and restoring backsliders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>James concept was filled with the things of Judaism and not much with the things concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In contrast to James, Paul was permeated, saturated, and soaked with the matters of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Again and again in his writings, he speaks regarding the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In his Epistles Paul writes concerning Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church in a profound way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in this Epistle James has little to say about Christ, the Spirit, life, or the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although we appreciate James emphasis on practical Christian perfection, we must go on through the help of Paul s ministry concerning God s economy to see that the church is built up with the riches of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Prayer of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In 5:15 James goes on to say, And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, it will be forgiven him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Greek word rendered prayer is not the usual form of the word for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This word is translated vow in Acts 18:18 and 21:23.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In verse 15 James mentions both sickness and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Committing sins is often the cause of sickness John 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In such cases forgiveness is always the cause of healing Matt 9:2, 5-7; Mark 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, in the first part of verse 16 James says, Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed.</S>
