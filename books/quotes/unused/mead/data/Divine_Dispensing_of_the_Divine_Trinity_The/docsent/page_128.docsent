   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWING THROUGH THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The anointing, the sealing, and the pledging are all a matter of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The indwelling Spirit is doing the work of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we are anointed with the Spirit, we experience the dispensing of the Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, the sealing and the pledging, which guarantees, assures, and cheers us, are also related to God s dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through the experience of the dispensing in the anointing, the sealing, and the pledging, we grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We not only receive the element and substance of the divine life, but we also receive the essence of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we are growing through the dispensing of the essence of the Triune God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not grow in life through doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Rather, we grow through the divine essence that is being dispensed into us day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only through the divine dispensing do we have real, actual, and practical growth unto maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SPEAKING FOR THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The anointing, sealing, and pledging of the Holy Spirit in the divine dispensing also lead to the real, actual, and practical constitution of a ministry within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning this ministry, we all need to practice speaking for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should speak not only in the church meetings but also at home.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We all need to be prepared, exercised, and trained to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CAPTIVES AND INCENSE-BEARERS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 2:14 Paul says, But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here Paul uses the metaphor of a triumphal procession.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Often after a general of the Roman army had won a victory, he would march through the capital with his captives in a procession to celebrate his victory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul used this metaphor to illustrate how Christ is the victorious general and how Paul and all believers are His captives.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is leading a triumphal procession of His captives to celebrate His victory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek verb rendered leads us in triumph as used in 2:14 means to lead a man as a captive in a triumphal procession; the full phrase means to lead captive in a triumph over the enemies of Christ...God is celebrating His triumph over His enemies; Paul who had been so great an opponent of the gospel is a captive following in the train of the triumphal procession, yet at the same time, by a characteristic change of metaphor an incense-bearer, scattering incense which was always done on these occasions as the procession moves on.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some of the conquered enemies were put to death when the procession reached the Capitol; to them the smell of incense was an odor of death unto death; to the rest who were spared, an odor of life unto life Conybeare .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God always leads the apostles in such a triumphant way for their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s leading is His dispensing of Himself into the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In their ministry God dispenses the virtues of Christ in His Person and work into them in triumph, and their ministry is a procession celebrating Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 2:12 through 7:16 Paul speaks about the ministry of himself and his co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He first likens their ministry to a celebration of Christ s victory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their move in their ministry for Christ is like a triumphal procession from one place to another under God s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He and his co-workers are Christ s captives, bearing the fragrant incense of Christ, for His triumphant glory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They have been conquered by Christ and have become His captives in the train of His triumph, scattering the fragrance of Christ from place to place.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is their ministry for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As conquered and captured ones in the train of Christ s triumph, Paul and his co-workers celebrated and participated in Christ s triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The apostles were such captives; their move as captives of Christ in their ministry for Him was God s celebration of Christ s victory over His enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As we have pointed out, as captives in Christ s triumphal procession, Paul and his co-workers were also incense-bearers, scattering the savor of the knowledge of Christ in His triumphant ministry as in a triumphal procession.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostles were such incense-bearers in the ministry of Christ as well as captives in the train of His triumph.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 2:14 Paul speaks of the savor of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the Greek usage, savor and knowledge are in apposition, so that the knowledge of Christ is symbolized as an odor communicating its nature and efficacy through the apostle s work Vincent .</S>
