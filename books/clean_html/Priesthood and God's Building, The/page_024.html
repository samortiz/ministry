<h2 class="head1">GOD IN THE LAMB FLOWING OUT TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible is a story of God coming to be the Lamb of God so that He can flow out of the throne for reigning and dispensing grace. His reigning and this dispensing of grace are the means by which He flows into man. As the Son, He is man&rsquo;s food, and as the Spirit, He is the water of life. This is the way that He is received and enjoyed by man. Those who enjoy God, who let Him flow through them, are transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 &ldquo;God formed man from the dust of the ground&rdquo; (v. 7). First Corinthians 15 confirms this: &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy...As the earthy is, such are they also that are earthy&rdquo; (vv. 47, 48). As the descendants of Adam, we are earthy. However, God has the appearance of a precious stone. In Exodus 24:10 He has the appearance of sapphire, a precious stone. In Revelation 4:3 God is like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance, both of which are precious stones. God does not have an earthy element; everything related to God has the appearance of a precious stone. First Corinthians 15:48 says, &ldquo;As the heavenly is, such are they also that are heavenly.&rdquo; Therefore, all those who belong to God will be transformed into precious stones. They will be transformed by God entering into them to be their life, that is, by His being the bread of life and the water of life for their enjoyment.</p>
<p>The lamb is at the beginning of the Bible (Gen. 3:21; 4:4). At the Feast of the Passover the lamb became food (Exo. 12:1-14). Afterward, manna replaced the lamb as food (16:4, 16-35); manna refers to the bread of life (John 6:32, 49-50). There was also the water that flowed out of the smitten rock for the Israelites to drink (Exo. 17:6). In their journey through the wilderness the children of Israel enjoyed manna and water. After they entered into Canaan, the children of Israel enjoyed a land with mountains, rivers, wheat, and barley (Deut. 8:7-8). This means that there was something for them to eat and drink. The Bible describes Canaan as &ldquo;a land flowing with milk and honey&rdquo; (Exo. 3:8, 17). Milk and honey are not only products of the combination of two kinds of lives, the animal life and the vegetable life, but also the blending of food and drink. Milk and honey are food as well as drink. Since milk and honey come out of life, they are a supply for man to live by. These matters are covered in the Bible.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the Bible speaks of only one matter: God as the Lamb coming out of the throne to be man&rsquo;s bread of life and water of life. Whoever lets God flow through him will be transformed into gold, pearl, and precious stone. Whoever does not let God flow through him will manifest only wood, grass, and stubble, materials that are good only for burning with fire (1 Cor. 3:12-15).</p>
<p>After man was created, he was placed in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden. In the garden there was a river, and the flow of the river issued in gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. Eventually, a counterpart was produced for the man (Gen. 2:7-24). The entire Bible is concerning God flowing out to be the tree of life and the river of life so that man can be transformed into gold, pearl, and precious stones and be built up to become God&rsquo;s counterpart. God flows out of the throne in the Lamb, and the throne is a throne for reigning and for dispensing grace.</p>
<p>On the negative side, there is another stream in the Bible&mdash;a stream of fire. The stream of water begins in Genesis 2, but the stream of fire begins in chapter 3. After man sinned, God placed &ldquo;a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life&rdquo; (v. 24). This is the beginning of the stream of fire. Daniel 7:10 says, &ldquo;A stream of fire issued forth.&rdquo; This stream of fire will sweep everything that is not of God into the lake of fire. The Bible concludes with water and fire&mdash;a city of water and a lake of fire. The New Jerusalem is a city of the river of water of life; it is a city filled with the water of life. In contrast, the lake of fire outside the city is filled with fire. Every person, thing, and matter throughout the generations that rebelled against God will be swept away by the stream of fire into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15; 21:8). God&rsquo;s throne is for imparting grace as well as for reigning. God reigns by dealing with His enemy with fire. God imparts grace by dealing graciously with His redeemed people with water. The stream of fire eventually becomes the lake of fire, and the stream of water flows through all God&rsquo;s redeemed people and transforms them into the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The flow of God as life in man brings in light and the way. Revelation 21 mentions light and the street (vv. 23-24, 21). This street follows the flow of life, and the light is God in the Lamb. God is light to man, and He is also man&rsquo;s way. The city is also the temple, where God dwells with man (v. 22). The city contains the glory of God, which is God expressed. Everything that God gives man, whether love, light, or grace, is in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE GOSPEL OF JOHN AND REVELATION</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John has a very strong beginning, but it does not seem to have a conclusion. John wrote, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). But at the end, he recorded a few incidents that transpired after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, such as the disciples catching a hundred and fifty-three fish (21:11); the Lord asking Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; (v. 15); and the Lord saying, &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; (v. 19). These words do not seem appropriate as a conclusion.</p>
<p>The conclusion to the Gospel of John is in Revelation. The book of Revelation does not seem to have a beginning, but it has a very strong conclusion. John&rsquo;s Gospel and Revelation are one complete book. His Gospel is the first half, and Revelation is the second half. The first half has a strong beginning but does not have a conclusion, and the latter half does not seem to have a beginning but has a very good conclusion. The Gospel of John shows that God comes in the Lamb as life to be man&rsquo;s food and living water so that man can have a life relationship with Him. He is the vine, and we are the branches. Revelation shows that the ones who have a relationship with God are His lampstands (1:20). Every person, thing, and matter that is not in the lampstands will be judged by God with fire and will end up in the lake of fire. Then the New Jerusalem will be manifested. The New Jerusalem is a corporate entity composed of God and all those who have received Him as their life, who are joined to Him, and who are built together. God is everything to them. This is the eternal conclusion. Hence, Revelation is the conclusion of the Gospel of John. Every positive thing, such as the tabernacle, the Lamb, the bride, light, the way, life, the living water, and the bread of life, that is mentioned in the Gospel of John is in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The entire Bible speaks of God in His redemption, that is, God in the Lamb flowing out through His reigning and His dispensing of grace, in order for man to receive Him as food and drink. Whoever receives Him will eventually become a part of the New Jerusalem. Those who do not receive Him will end up in the lake of fire. Our responsibility is to receive Him into us and to let Him flow out of us. When we pray, sing hymns, and speak for God, we let Him flow out of us.</p>
