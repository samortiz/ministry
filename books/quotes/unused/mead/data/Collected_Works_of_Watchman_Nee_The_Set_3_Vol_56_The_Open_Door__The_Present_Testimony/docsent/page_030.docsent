   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"Spiritual" Unity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is a second kind of unity today which can be found throughout the world, and it is called "spiritual" unity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the definition of this spiritual unity, and from where does it originate?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>State Religions</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Originally, Roman Catholicism was the state religion of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The term state religion has a very interesting definition: It means the religion of a nation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The nation, the king, or the emperor ordains such a religion for its people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, once a person is born as a subject of a nation, he becomes a member of the religion of that nation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If a person is a Roman citizen, he automatically joins the Roman religion.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Either a person has no nationality and therefore has no membership in any nation's religion, or he is born a citizen of a nation and consequently is a member of the religion of that nation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whether or not he is willing, he must take part in that religion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not a matter that is left up to him to decide; it has been decided by the emperor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If he depends upon the nation for his living, he must take part in the nation's religion.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the Roman Empire accepted Roman Catholicism as the state religion, the membership of the Roman Catholic Church became the same as the population of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Formerly, the members of the church only equaled the number of those who through repentance had been regenerated and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now, however, no one needed to join the church per se.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as one was born in the country and his father was a Roman, he was qualified to become a member of the Roman religion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There was no need for him to experience regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My father is Chinese, and I was born of my father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is unnecessary for me to be naturalized in order for me to become a Chinese, because I am Chinese by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This was the situation in the Roman Catholic Church; once one was born a Roman, he was a member of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One who was born of the flesh could now become a "child" of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This completely changed the word in John 1:12-13.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It became unnecessary to be born of God or to receive the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, being born of blood, of the will of the flesh, and of the will of man was all that was necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as one was a Roman, he was a member of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Protestantism Originally Being</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>a State Religion Also</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At the beginning of the Protestant movement, Martin Luther only wanted to reform the Roman Catholic Church; he did not expect to form a new church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The formation of a new church was not due to religious reasons, but to political ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because the Roman pope ruled over the whole world, even the emperor was afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to the pope, emperors ruled over the human body, while he ruled over the human soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though the pope's body was ruled over by the emperor, the emperor's soul was ruled over by the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Kaiser could have been the greatest imperialist, but he could do nothing against the pope; the pope ruled over him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the pope closed the door to the heavenly kingdom, no one could enter in, not even a king.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In effect, the pope ruled over the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, the kings of all the nations were very afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were kings, yet someone ruled over them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They were kings, yet someone above them was their king.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The pope was the supreme ruler of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Luther rose up to reform the church, these kings realized that there was a way for them to separate themselves from Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They did not want the pope to rule over their souls; they wanted to rule themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They wanted a different church, one not ruled over by the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In certain things the commandments they gave could be altered by the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The pope could just issue another commandment, and the people dared not disobey, because disobedience to the pope meant that their souls would go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Luther rose up and took advantage of this opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He preached justification by faith, that is, the right of every man to go to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There were many kings and princes who waited for Luther to go ahead and who were willing to support him with force.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The pope tried to quell the reformers by force.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In response, the kings seized the opportunity to send out armies to battle, and the fighting was fierce.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Afterwards, not only was there a separation of doctrine but also a separation from the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What was the result?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Those who followed Luther's teaching became part of the Church of Germany in Germany, the Church of Holland in Holland, and the Church of England in England.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Originally, the Roman Empire encompassed the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Germany, Holland, and England were smaller kingdoms within it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now Germany had its own Lutheran Church, Holland had its own Dutch Reformed Church, and England had its own Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These were also state churches, only they were smaller than the Roman Church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Anyone born of British parents becomes a member of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The moment one comes out of the womb of his mother, he is automatically a member of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the reason behind infant baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is necessary to have an infant registered in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Since he is British, he is automatically a member of the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is unnecessary to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is only a matter of registration.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If he is registered, he is a member.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One can be born an Englishman and a Christian at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Later, when private churches were raised up, the members had to leave the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Members of these private churches were called "dissenters," which means that they dissented from the state church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They were originally in the state church, but when they wanted to come out they first had to leave the state church in order to join another.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If a person wanted to join the Wesleyan Church, he first had to leave the Anglican Church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They were dissenters; otherwise, they would not have come out.</S>
