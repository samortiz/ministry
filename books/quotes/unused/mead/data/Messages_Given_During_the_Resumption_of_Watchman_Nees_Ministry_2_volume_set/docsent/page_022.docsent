   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE HOW TO ABIDE IN CHRIST FELLOWSHIP MEETING 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Morning, December 27, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>HOW TO ABIDE IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Shen asked: How can we abide in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. Knowing the Teaching of the Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Lee answered: First John 2:27 mentions the anointing: "The anointing which you have received from Him...."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Greek, the word anointing is a gerund; it is not a simple noun.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The anointing as a gerund denotes a moving and an application of an ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Within us we have the teaching of the anointing, and we do not need any teaching from man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This anointing is true and is not a lie, and even as it has taught us, we should abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God abides in us, and we abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although these appear to be two different things, yet in fact they are not two things, but one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>B. The Lord's Abiding in Us Being Based</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>on Our Abiding in Him</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament, there is a difference between the two phrases "in the Lord" and "abiding in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To be in the Lord refers to being saved, whereas to abide in the Lord refers to living an overcoming life, one that is in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To abide in the Lord is to have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord's abiding in us is based upon our abiding in Him, while our abiding in Him is based upon our being in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When electricity is installed to a lamp, it can be considered as being "in" the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when the switch is turned on and electricity is applied, then the electricity is "abiding" in the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people abide in sin, the flesh, and the world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although such a one may be a person in Christ, he does not abide in Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may be a person who belongs to Christ, yet you never abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have asked if a person who is abiding in Christ can move out again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, in our experience, we can move in and out more than a dozen times within a day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fact of our being in Christ is once for all and can never change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But our abiding in the Lord and the Lord's abiding in us is something relative.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the entire New Testament, you cannot find one incident where it says that He will abide in us without us abiding in Him first; these two things are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Romans 8 mentions the Holy Spirit abiding in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every saved person has the Holy Spirit in him, but this does not mean that every one has the Holy Spirit abiding in him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit does not have the complete authority over every one yet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's abiding in us is based on our abiding in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>C. Abiding in the Lord according to</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>the Teaching of the Anointing</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How do we abide in God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We abide in Him according to the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Spirit operates in us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This operation is the application of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose you want to joke with Brother Shen, but there is an inner restriction that tells you not to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you disobey it and keep on joking, you will lose the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You will be cut off from the Lord and will not be able to continue in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This disruption in fellowship can last for a whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only after you confess your sin will this fellowship with God be resumed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Consider again the example of the sisters scolding their children or their servants.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A sister does not need someone outside of her to tell her that this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, the operation inside of her will restrict her.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The greatest punishment to a Christian is not outward sufferings, but being cut off from his fellowship with the Lord.</S>
