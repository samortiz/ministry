When we remain in the spirit, we can love properly and will also be gentle, godly, and spiritual. When we remain in our spirit, we have all the virtues. The virtues of humility, patience, endurance, love, and kindness flow from the one fountain of our human spirit. A believer in Christ is one who is living and remaining in his spirit all the day long. All the day long he is a person in his spirit.</P><P>We who are believers should live neither in our soul nor in our body. We should be those who always live in our spirit. When we live in the spirit, we may be happy and laugh, but we will not laugh too much. Likewise, we will not be easily offended or angered. In the human spirit there is no ground for anything negative. The Chinese ethical teachers such as Confucius taught that within human beings there is a part which they called the bright virtue. The part to which they referred is the conscience. Regardless of how fallen man is, within him there is still a preserved part. This is the reason people respond when we preach the gospel to them. Even within an evil person, there is still a part which responds to God. In man's fall God drew a line which Satan could not cross. God has preserved a part of our being for Himself. Proverbs 20:27 says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the inward parts of the belly" (Heb.). God created a spirit in man as His lamp, and where the lamp is, there is light. We are not like the wild beasts. The beasts do not have a bright part in their being, but men, even the unbelievers, do have such a part. Before we were saved, we sometimes were bad. However, there was a part of our being which was not bad. Sometimes it would tell us that what we were doing was wrong. This was our spirit as the lamp of the Lord, observing us and enlightening us within for God.</P><P>To be saved is to be brought back from our lustful body and our thoughtful soul to the right part of our being, our spirit. We should always try our best to remain in our spirit. In the Lord's recovery, there has been a turmoil for several years. The source of the turmoil was the failure to remain in the spirit. Arguments and accusations have their source both in the soul and in the flesh. It is possible even to talk about the things concerning the Lord and the church with hatred in our being. Such talk is too much in the mind, the soul, and even in the body (flesh). If we would all come back to our spirit, there would be no problems.</P><P>Exchanging of words among married couples is common. This exchange happens because we are in the flesh and the soul. In such a situation, both parties have to turn back to their spirit. If both persons come back to their spirit, there will be no further exchange of words. When we are going to lose our temper, we must always be reminded to turn to our spirit. The Christian life is a life absolutely in our spirit.</P><P>We have seen the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, who is also the Holy Spirit, in the work of the old creation and the work of the new creation. This Spirit eventually was consummated as the consummation of the Triune God, and He desires to enter into man's spirit and remain there. Now that we have received the Spirit, He is in our spirit. As long as we remain in our spirit, everything is right. God is satisfied, and to be sure, we are satisfied. Revelation 1:10 says, "I was in spirit on the Lord's day." Many times I have tried doing nothing, saying nothing, and thinking nothing, but simply remaining in my spirit. This brings a restful feeling, and in this restful feeling, we receive light and the supply of the inner life as grace. Often I receive the messages for the ministry while in this restful spirit. When we are talking too much, we should simply be quiet and turn back to our spirit to meet with the divine Spirit in our human spirit and enjoy His presence, His anointing, and His supplying in every way.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages to the Trainees in Fall 1990 &nbsp; pg 21</div><br></body></html>
