Luke also said something, and James, even in his short book, has a very sweet verse concerning the kingdom. "Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?" (James 2:5). Not only are we those rich in faith, but we are also heirs of the kingdom which God has promised to give to them who love Him. The kingdom is a matter of God's promise, and as such, is a gift. The kingdom is a free gift! God will give us the kingdom according to His promise. Luke, in his Gospel said the same thing: "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom" (Luke 12:32). Not only did God promise to give the kingdom to us, but it is His good pleasure to do so. God is so happy to give us the kingdom. It is His good pleasure, His good intention, and His joy to give us the kingdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WILLING TO RECEIVE THE KINGDOM</H2><P>Although God is happy to give us the kingdom, are we willing to receive the kingdom? This gift is a matter of giving and receiving. It takes both sides. If I have a gift for you, but you are not willing to receive it, what can I do? I am helpless. God is happy to give us the kingdom, but are we ready to receive the kingdom? It is like salvation&#151;God is happy to give His salvation to people as a free gift, but so many worldly people have not received His salvation. Why? It is because they are not willing to receive it. God is ready to give, but they will not receive it. Are you willing to receive the kingdom? God is ready to give the kingdom, and we must be willing and ready to receive it. We all must say, "Hallelujah! Thank You for the kingdom, Lord. I am so willing to receive it."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SEEKING ONLY THE KINGDOM</H2><P>If we are willing to receive the kingdom, Luke gives us another verse: "And Jesus said unto him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God" (Luke 9:62). If we put our hands to the plow, taking the kingdom, and look back, we are not worthy of the kingdom. If we are willing to take the kingdom, we must go on. We must not look back. We should not seek the same things the worldly people are seeking. We should not be concerned with what we eat, what we drink, and so many other things. Rather, we must seek the kingdom of God, and God will add these things to us. If we seek the kingdom of God, surely God will give us the kingdom plus all our needs.</P><P>Do not consider that it is such a high and difficult thing to receive the kingdom. Because it is something of God's promise and free gift it is not that difficult to receive. To give us the kingdom is God's good pleasure. He is happy to give us the kingdom. The only need is that we would be willing to receive the kingdom. If we are willing to receive the kingdom, we should forget about all the other things. God will take care of what we need&#151;what we eat and what we drink. We should take no thought about those things. God will take care of them.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_266.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_268.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Kingdom &nbsp; pg 267</div><br></body></html>
