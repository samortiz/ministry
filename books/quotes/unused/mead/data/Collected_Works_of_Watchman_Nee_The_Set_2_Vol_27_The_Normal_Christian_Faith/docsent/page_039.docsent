   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FORGIVENESS IS TO SUFFER LOSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I believe we have to see one more aspect of the meaning of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Forgiveness implies bearing the transgressor's loss by the transgressed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, if someone has stolen my pencil and I have forgiven him, it means that I have suffered the loss of a pencil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What then is unforgiveness?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It simply means to take back the pencil from the thief in order that I may not suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, to forgive is to suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the student broke the vase, she should have been the one to make reparation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Unforgiveness means that she would have to suffer a loss by payment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Forgiveness, on the other hand, means that the transgressed, who was the principal, had to take up the loss by paying for it herself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, when God forgives our sins, it means that He takes up the loss incurred by our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No third party can forgive our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the transgressed can suffer the loss of the transgressor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is God, the One against whom we sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His forgiveness is the suffering of the loss of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CHRIST AS A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to realize that Christ is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He bore our sins as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God looked at Christ as a man and included all of us in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When God judged Christ, He judged us also.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, God has judged us in Christ and also forgiven us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This forgiveness is perfectly just.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Second Corinthians 5:14 says, "Because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The "One" here refers to Christ, and the "all" refers to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Christ died, we all died with Him because we were all included in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is said that all Chinese came from the one man Hwang-ti.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If in the very beginning, somebody had killed Hwang-ti, he would have killed the whole Chinese race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When Christ passed through the judgment, we passed through the same.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His death became our termination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 21: "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The One "who did not know sin" is again Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was made to be sin for us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does it mean to be "made sin"?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It means that when Christ was hung on the cross, God regarded Him as the sin of you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He looked at Christ as sin representing the whole human race.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Christ died, sin was all-inclusively terminated and removed.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now all of us who are in Him have our sins terminated; we become the righteousness of God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>IT IS THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD TO FORGIVE US</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why does it say "become the righteousness of God," rather than "become righteous"?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is the difference between the two?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To become righteous implies that we have done a good work, whereas to be made the righteousness of God declares that God Himself is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is a big difference between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God did not forgive our sins in an unrighteous way; He forgave in a very righteous way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He has punished Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As a result of this punishment, He can forgive us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has not glossed over us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God is not an evasive God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When He grants forgiveness, He does so in a just manner.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Once I was going to Chiu-kang on a boat with a friend.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>A Moslem was reading on the deck of the same boat.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After beginning a conversation with him, I told him that I would like to know if his scripture mentioned any way of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He said, "All that one needs to do is repent of one's past evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The sin will then be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why is there the need for salvation?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I replied that if God forgives in this way, He Himself sins in His forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was very surprised at what I said.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It seemed that he had never heard such a thing before.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I asked, "Do you think that it is righteous for a man to be forgiven of his sins once he repents of them?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For example, when a criminal is brought before a judge, is it right for the judge to release him merely on the basis of his repentance?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After thinking for a while, he admitted that this was not just.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Unfortunately, I had no time to explain to him the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The salvation of God is based on the judgment of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We receive our forgiveness in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>SETTING JESUS AS THE PROPITIATION COVER</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Romans 3:25-26: "Whom God set forth as a propitiation place through faith in His blood, for the demonstrating of His righteousness, in that in His forbearance God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time, so that He might be righteous and the One who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This portion of the Scripture is not easily understood.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, there are two points which we need to notice.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God set forth Christ as a propitiation place.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the original language the words "propitiation place" mean propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the Old Testament, the ark of the covenant was covered by a golden lid called the propitiation cover translated by the King James Version as "mercy seat" .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Man's prayer passed through this cover to reach God, and God's answer went through the same to meet man.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>That was a meeting place between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now Jesus has become this propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is the focal point of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Both can now meet in Him on the basis of His blood.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Jesus has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He has shed His blood and forgiven our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Now He has become our propitiation cover.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Before Jesus died, "God passed over the sins that had previously occurred, with a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness in the present time."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>From Adam to Jesus, for more than four thousand years, countless sins were committed by man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Although God passed over them, He did not let them go by.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This shows His righteousness in former times.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the present time, He has sent His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We are now justified in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>In itself this very justification is a just act.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This passage tells us the different ways that God handled these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>First, He passed over the sins committed formerly, reckoning that Jesus would come; in this He proved Himself righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Second, He forgives all the sins committed now, basing this upon the judgment of Christ; in this He also declares Himself righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>By the death of Jesus, God has both declared us sinless as well as Himself righteous.</S>
