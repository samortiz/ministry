   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT PRACTICING TO SET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, how we worship You as the Triune God, the very processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We thank You that You have gone through so many processes, and You have achieved so much, making Yourself even a law within us the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we thank You for this wonderful oracle, an oracle comprised of all the seeking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How we praise You for Your recovery, that You have opened up Your word, even Romans 8, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, we trust in You again.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have no trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Thank You for the cleansing blood, and thank You for the anointing ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, we are here waiting on You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, You know how much we look unto You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, grant us new thought, the fresh up-to-date word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, grant us the instant utterance of the rich expression, even, Lord, the instant understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, we are unable to speak; neither can we listen.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, help us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We surely need Your help.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Lord, we like to be helped by You.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have the confidence that You are one spirit with us in the speaking and in the listening.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Oh Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Victory is Yours!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Oh, defeat must go to the enemy!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Put him in the corner tonight!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Shame him again!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this Perfecting Training message, we need to consider Romans 8:5-8.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Doctrinally, it is difficult to understand these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you merely study these four verses doctrinally, all you will get is a puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Your study will lead you into a thick forest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After I was saved in 1925, I studied these four verses a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The more I studied, the more I couldn t understand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now I would say that to understand these verses you need some experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These verses could only be apprehended according to your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you don t have the experience, you cannot understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>MINDING THE THINGS OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The main point in verse 5 is the minding.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is not the thinking, but the minding of the things of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 5 indicates that those who are according to something mind something.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>By reading it in this way you can see that minding is the major thing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What are you minding?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are you minding the things of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This doesn t mean just thinking or reasoning, but minding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>SETTING THE MIND ON THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What then is the major point in verse 6?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The major point is the setting of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a difference between minding the things of the Spirit and setting the mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One is minding, and the other is setting the mind on something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE MIND SET ON THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verse 7 reads, Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can it be.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The major thing in verse 7 is a mind set on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a little more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, there was the minding of the things of the spirit and also the setting of the mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This major point in verse 7 is more complicated, because it brings in another element, that is, the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now the problem is not only of your mind, but also of the flesh and the mind set on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>So the major thing in this verse is the mind set on the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>BEING IN THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 8 reads, And those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The major item in verse 8 is the matter of being in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus these four verses cover four major things: minding the things of the Spirit, setting the mind on the spirit, the mind set on the flesh, and being in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Most Bible readers are distracted from the major things in these four verses.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, they pay their attention to other points, such as life and peace in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Others may pay attention to dark things, to black things, such as death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some have written concerning enmity against God using verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They also spoke of what it means to be subject to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Some also talk about the disability or the impossibility mentioned in verse 7.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then in verse 8 they pointed out that the flesh is unable to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These points, however, are not the major points.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The major things are a mind set on the flesh or on the spirit and the matter of being in the flesh.</S>
