   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the previous messages, we saw the truth concerning the second coming of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this message we want to see the truth concerning the kingdom of a thousand years revealed in Revelation 20:4-6.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is generally called the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The kingdom of a thousand years is different from the New Testament church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There are no Old Testament saints in the church age, but in the kingdom of a thousand years, the overcoming Old Testament saints are present with the overcoming New Testament saints.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The kingdom of a thousand years includes Old Testament saints such as Abraham, Noah, Moses, David, and Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These were some of the ones who were overcoming in the Old Testament times.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Just before the Lord was transfigured on the mount, He told His disciples, There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom Matt 16:28 .</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moses and Elijah represent the Old Testament overcomers who will be in the manifestation of the kingdom, whereas Peter, James, and John represent the New Testament overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ones selected to reign as kings in the kingdom of a thousand years will be the overcomers, the perfected ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The history of man from the creation of Adam can be divided into four ages.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The time of the patriarchs was before the law was given, so we can term it the age before the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It began from the creation of Adam and concluded at the time that Moses received the law and passed the law on to the children of Israel.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church age began at the day of Pentecost with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body and continues to the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the church age, God works Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is presently working Himself into us every day.</S>
