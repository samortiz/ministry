   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Third Presumption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our brothers say that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit will no longer be on the earth, for when the Lord Jesus raptures the church to the heavens, He also raptures the Holy Spirit to the heavens, so that the Holy Spirit will no longer be on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They base their words on 2 Thessalonians 2:6-8: "And now you know that which restrains, so that he might be revealed in his own time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For it is the mystery of lawlessness that is now operating, but only until the one now restraining goes out of the way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And then the lawless one will be revealed."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They say that here is a great sinner, who is the son of perdition, and who is commonly called the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The restraining one is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After the Holy Spirit is taken out of the way, the lawless one will be revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How is the Holy Spirit taken out of the way?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Holy Spirit will be taken out of the way by being raptured.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After this, Antichrist will be revealed and the great tribulation will begin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They say, "Since the Holy Spirit will no longer be on the earth, how can the church still be on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the whole church must have been raptured before the tribulation."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Can such a presumption stand?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have much biblical evidence to prove that such a presumption is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1 First we need to ask, is the restraining one the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible calls the Holy Spirit by many names, for example, the Spirit, the Spirit of wisdom, the Spirit of revelation, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are also many other names with the word Spirit attached.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>True, the Bible also calls the Holy Spirit a consoling One or the Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But immediately after this, the Bible tells us that this is the Spirit of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Which verse in the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the restraining one?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is no verse in the Bible that says that the Holy Spirit is the restraining one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Saying that the restraining one is the Holy Spirit is clearly a presumption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 Can the expression "goes out of the way" be explained as "is being raptured"?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It says "goes out of the way," not "raptured out of the way."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Is "going out of the way" a likely expression to describe the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Can we say that "to go out of the way" is to be raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible does not allow us to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows that saying that going out of the way is to be raptured is again a presumption.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3 Does the Bible say that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit will not be on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our brothers say that there is no Holy Spirit on the earth during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They also say that during the great tribulation countless people will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How can these two things be reconciled?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Holy Spirit is no longer on the earth; yet there are more people saved than when the Holy Spirit was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What kind of teaching is this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I believe that if there is one person saved during the great tribulation, it will still be the work of the Holy Spirit on the earth, because that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>4 Revelation 4:5 says, "Seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 5:6 says, "I saw...a Lamb standing as having just been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Bible tells us that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit does work, for the Bible says He is "sent forth into all the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>5 The Bible never says that the Holy Spirit is raptured to heaven before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the contrary, it says that during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit will be greatly poured out as the latter rain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Concerning this, we can read the following two paragraphs in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Joel 2:28-32 says, "And afterward I will pour out My Spirit upon all flesh,/And your sons and your daughters will prophesy;/Your old men will dream dreams;/Your young men will see visions./Indeed even upon the servants and the maids /In those days I will pour out My Spirit./And I will do wonders in the heavens and on earth:/Blood and fire and pillars of smoke./The sun will be turned into darkness,/And the moon, into blood,/Before the great and terrible/Day of Jehovah comes./And all who call on the name of Jehovah will be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts 2:15-21 says, "For these men are not drunk, as you suppose, for it is the third hour of the day; but this is what is spoken through the prophet Joel: And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream things in dreams; and indeed upon My slaves, both men and women, I will pour out of My Spirit in those days, and they shall prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And I will show wonders in heaven above and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and vapor of smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable day of the Lord comes.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here I would like to draw your attention to what Peter said, "But this is what is spoken through the prophet Joel" Peter did not say the day of Pentecost fulfilled what Joel said.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The day of Pentecost did not fulfill literally what Joel said.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The day of Pentecost did not have the five unusual scenes described in Joel 2:30-31: "Blood and fire and pillars of smoke./The sun will be turned into darkness,/And the moon, into blood."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There were no such unusual scenes at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When will Joel's word be fulfilled?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It will be fulfilled at the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can look for these five unusual scenes in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Revelation 6:12 says, "When He opened the sixth seal...the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The unusual scenes of the sun and the moon here match Joel's word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Revelation 8:7-10, at the sounding of the first and second trumpets, there is fire and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the third trumpet is sounded, there is also fire.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>These match Joel's word concerning the unusual scenes of fire and blood.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Revelation 9:2, at the sounding of the fifth trumpet, smoke rises out of the pit of the abyss like the smoke of a great furnace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This also matches Joel's word of the scene of the pillars of smoke.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, we can say that these things will be greatly fulfilled during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Holy Spirit will be poured out greatly at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The time of Pentecost was but a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, Peter did not say it "fulfilled" what Joel said.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He merely said that it was that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel It means that particular situation was somewhat similar to what Joel had spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It means that particular situation resembled the events spoken of by Joel</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Therefore, according to Joel, during the tribulation the Holy Spirit will do an unprecedented work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>At that time, without the power of the Holy Spirit, men will surely not be able to stand the many persecutions and afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Based on what Joel said, the Holy Spirit will not be raptured during the tribulation; rather, He will be poured out as never before and will do an extraordinary work.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If during the great tribulation the Holy Spirit is still on the earth, then our brothers' reasoning, that the Holy Spirit's rapture means the church's rapture, no longer has any biblical foundation to it.</S>
