   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>17:1 And after six days Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his brother, and brought them up to a 1 high mountain privately.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>28 1 This was fulfilled by the Lord's transfiguration on the mountain 17:1-2 .</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was seen by His three disciples Peter, James, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1 1 Since the Lord's transfiguration occurred six days after the revelations given at the foot of Mount Hermon in ch.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>16 concerning Christ and the church, the high mountain here must be Mount Hermon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To receive the revelation concerning Christ and the church, we must be far away from the religious environment; but to see the vision of the transfigured Christ, we need to be on a high mountain, far above the earthly level.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The record from 13:53 17:8 portrays the way to follow the heavenly King, from His rejection to the entering of the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When they were on the stormy sea under the contrary wind, He walked on the sea, calmed the storm, and brought them through 14:22-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At that point many sick ones were healed by touching Him 14:35-36 , but the hypocritical worshippers of God came to heckle Him because His followers transgressed their tradition 15:1-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then His disciples followed Him to a Gentile region, where a demon possessed Gentile was healed 15:21-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After that, they followed Him along the sea of Galilee and up the mountain, where all kinds of sick people were healed and the need of His followers and the crowd was again richly provided for in a barren wilderness 15:29-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After that, both the fundamentalists and the modernists of that day came to tempt Him, and He indicated that He would die to be a unique sign to them 16:1-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He charged His followers to beware of the leaven of both the fundamentalists and the modernists 16:5-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After all that, He brought His followers to the border of the Holy Land, close to a Gentile land, that they might have a revelation of Him, of the church, and of the cross as the way for them to enter into the kingdom 16:13-28 .</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thirty-four years ago, I gave a message on this portion of the Word in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I had just arrived there as a newcomer in the work with Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I was asked to give the message one Sunday morning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then I received the burden to minister on the subject of the pathway to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nearly all the points in that message were the same as those covered in these messages on the pathway to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although I had not yet seen the matter of eating, the structure of the message was the same as that of these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How wonderful it is to be on the pathway to glory!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I can testify that during the past forty-four years I have taken every step of this pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because I have been walking this pathway for such a long time, in a sense I have already entered into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others of us are either in the glory or are very close to it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although some of us may be in the glory, we are still on the pathway to a greater degree of glory.</S>
