   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIVING STONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord Jesus told Peter twice that he was a stone John 1:42; Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Evidently, he never forgot it because when Peter wrote his first Epistle, he not only said that Christ was a living stone, but also that all who come to Him are living stones to be built up as a spiritual house for God 1 Pet 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord reminded Peter that he was a stone, and later Peter reminded us that we are stones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GROWTH BY THE PURE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew 13 tells us about the need for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Peter 2 also tells us that we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As newborn babes we should desire the pure milk of the Word that we may grow and become the living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can become living stones by growing because transformation is included in the process of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we consider the verses in 1 Peter 2 we will realize that both growth and transformation are found there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is no transformation with the growth, how can one who desires milk be a living stone?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To be sure, the ones who desire milk are not yet living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, after drinking the milk of the Word, they will grow and be transformed into living stones for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Again we have growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Matthew 13 we have growth and transformation; in Matthew 16 we have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are stones, and the Lord is building us into the church which is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The builded church has authority, and the gates of Hades, signifying the power of Satan, cannot prevail against it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the church, a building of transformed materials.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all must see what the kingdom is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not only a dispensation or a sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The kingdom is the building up of regenerated, transformed persons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This building is accomplished in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The builded church of Matthew 16 becomes the local church of Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot separate these two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is built in Matthew 16 is the local church found in Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some say that the church is only universal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If so, where is the universal church?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The universal church is the totality of all the local churches, even as a body is the totality of all its members.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there are no members, there is no body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The universal church does not exist by itself; it is a composition of all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who talk only about the universal church are afraid of being built up together with others in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As stones, we must be built into the local church.</S>
