   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE TWENTY-TWO THE SECOND FALL OF MAN 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After seeing man's first fall and God's proclamation of the glad tidings as recorded in Genesis 3, we now come to Genesis 4.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Apparently we are studying the fall; actually we are considering the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If there had been no fall, there would have been no glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Praise the Lord for the fall!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Man's fall has brought in God's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we come to a further step of man's fall and also to a further step in the proclamation of God's glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. The Second Fall 1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Background</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the time of Genesis 4 man had already fallen Gen 3:6-8, 22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, man had received God's promise of salvation 3:15 and had obtained God's way of salvation 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God promised Adam that the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the serpent, Adam believed and responded by calling his wife "Living."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Adam and Eve had been awaiting the sentence of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Thus, when they heard the glad tidings, Adam did not call his wife "Dying," but "Living."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As we pointed out in message nineteen, the whole human race is dying; no one is living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nevertheless, after hearing and receiving the gospel of God, man becomes living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hallelujah, we are living!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although Adam's response in Genesis 3:20 proves that he believed the gospel, we find no indication in that chapter that Eve also believed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, Genesis 4:1 tells us that Eve believed the glad tidings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bear Cain, and said, I have acquired a man, Jehovah" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eve brought forth a son and called him Cain, which means "acquired."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although Cain, the person, was evil, his name was very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Eve brought him forth, she declared, "I have acquired."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She had not acquired a house or some land; she had acquired a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to her concept, Cain was the seed of woman promised in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God had promised Eve that her seed would bruise the head of the serpent, the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eve's words in Genesis 4:1 prove that she had believed that promise and that she was expecting to have that seed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When her first boy was born, she declared, "I have acquired a man, Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you think that this translation is too bold, I ask you to consult the Hebrew text.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Hebrew text of Genesis 4:1 there is no preposition between the words "man" and "Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although some translators may add prepositions such as "from" or "with," there is no such preposition in this part of the Word according to the Hebrew text.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Hebrew text simply reads, "I have acquired a man, Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Concordant Version of Genesis renders it this way in the text, and the New American Standard Version places this translation in the margin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus, according to Eve's understanding, the child she bore in 4:1 was the fulfillment of the promise regarding the seed of the woman in 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, she called her child Jehovah, the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a statement, however, was premature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eve actually did not bear the man, Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Four thousand years later the virgin Mary gave birth to a child, and His name was called the mighty God Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The child born in the manger at Bethlehem was Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His name was called Jesus, which means, "Jehovah, the Savior" Matt 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Eve herself did not give birth to the man, Jehovah, she symbolized the virgin Mary who gave birth to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Eventually, the real seed of the woman came through the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, Jesus, Jehovah, the Savior, is truly the man, Jehovah to whom Eve supposed that she had given birth as mentioned in Genesis 4:1.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By giving her child the name Cain, Eve proved that she believed the gospel proclaimed by God in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Although four thousand years had to pass, the man, Jehovah eventually came through the virgin Mary.</S>
