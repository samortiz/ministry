<h2 class="head1">A STRONG ENCOURAGEMENT<br />
TO THE PRACTICE OF THE PROPER ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>All the above eight points are a strong encouragement to the practice of the proper one accord in the church for the keeping of the genuine oneness of the Body by all the saints and all the churches universally. We must consider that all these points came sovereignly into existence that we may be one in all things related to God, Christ, and the church, that we may spontaneously be exercised to practice the one accord according to all the attributes of oneness in the divine and spiritual interests. May the Lord bless us and grace us to practice the one accord according to these attributes of oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DISCOURAGEMENT TO THE ONE ACCORD,<br />
ENCOURAGING AND PROMOTING DIVISION</h2>
<p>Any teaching contrary to the above eight points, such as the teaching of the absolute autonomy of the local churches, is a discouragement to the one accord in the church and encourages and promotes division among the saints and among the churches. All our teachings should be in the nature and with the intention to encourage and promote the practice of the one accord for the keeping of the oneness. We should do our best in any teaching to avoid any discouragement to such a practice, so that the churches in all the localities can be built up in peace, without any disturbance, frustration, and distraction. May the Lord have mercy on all of us that we may practice the one accord to be kept from causing any kind of division and to have His economy carried out in the building up of His Body in oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRITUALITY OR SCRIPTURAL TEACHING<br />
NOT TO BE USED AS A CLOAK FOR DIVISION</h2>
<p>Any kind of spirituality or any kind of scriptural teaching should not be used as a cloak for division.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Saying &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo;<br />
Being Condemned by the Scripture</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:11-13, saying &ldquo;I am of Christ&rdquo; was condemned, just as saying &ldquo;I am of Paul,&rdquo; &ldquo;I am of Apollos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am of Cephas.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Taking the Enjoyment of Christ as an Excuse<br />
for Separation or for Division<br />
Also Being Condemned</h2>
<p>Taking the enjoyment of Christ as an excuse for separating oneself from the saints or for division among the churches also is condemned, just as saying &ldquo;I am of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preaching Christ Because Of Envy and Strife<br />
Being Condemned by the Scripture</h2>
<p>In Philippians 1:15 and 17, the Apostle Paul condemned those who preached Christ because of envy and strife, out of rivalry.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Using Teachings That Are Seemingly Scriptural<br />
as Reasons for Separation or for Division<br />
Also Being Condemned</h2>
<p>Using teachings such as the teaching concerning the headship of Christ, the teaching concerning all the churches being responsible directly to Christ alone, and the teaching concerning not exalting man, all of which seem very scriptural, as reasons for separation from the saints or for division among the churches also is condemned. As long as anything that is spiritual or scriptural causes separation or division, it is condemned.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CATHOLIC HIERARCHY</h2>
<p>The Catholic Church&rsquo;s organization, with the pope as its head and with the bishops in different ranks as subordinates, is a hierarchy, which is not scriptural and is condemned by the Lord. We abandon such hierarchy to the uttermost because it is abominable to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRETHREN &ldquo;FEDERATION&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Brethren assemblies&rsquo; uniformity, which resembles a federation, also is not scriptural.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIFFERENCES IN THE DEGREE OF MATURITY IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Any difference among the saints or among the churches in the degree of maturity in life is normal and is needed according to God&rsquo;s economy. God has arranged it so, and we should not attempt to make the saints or the churches uniform in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INTENTIONAL DIFFERENCES</h2>
<p>Any differences among the saints or among the churches that are intentional are abnormal and are condemned by the Scripture. Any intention to have differences among the saints or among the churches in order to demonstrate something or to oppose something should be condemned and rejected.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNITY WITH VARIETY<br />
AND VARIETY VERSUS UNIFORMITY</h2>
<p>For the keeping of the oneness of the Body of Christ that we might not be sectarian, we must tolerate certain differences, such as differences in the way of baptism and in the observing of days (Rom. 14:15). This we consider as unity with variety. By tolerating this kind of variety, we annul uniformity. This is variety versus uniformity. If we practice this, we can be in one accord in spite of the variety that we may have. Of course, we know that sprinkling as a means of baptism is not as scriptural as immersion, and that the keeping of the Sabbath is altogether not in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, yet we tolerate these kinds of differences which do not damage the faith according to the New Testament revelation. We tolerate this kind of variety with the expectation that the believers who are for unscriptural practices such as these may grow in life to become more mature in the fullness of the measure of Christ so that they may drop these differences and arrive at the oneness of the faith. We earnestly hope that these believers will also be tolerant of the fact that we are not the same in these practices as they are, so that they can be in the one accord for the keeping of the oneness of the Body. To practice the proper one accord according to all the points mentioned above will surely render much help in resolving the intrinsic problem in the present rebellion in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Thus, such a practice also is a part of the scriptural remedy for the present rebellion among us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>In the elders&rsquo; training in February 1986, I spoke on the matter of one accord (see <em>Elders&rsquo; Training&mdash;Book 7, One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move,</em> published by Living Stream Ministry). In those messages I mentioned the fact that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in Acts 2 was brought in through the one accord among the one hundred twenty believers (Acts 1:14; 2:1-4). Without the one accord, the outpouring of the Spirit probably would have been delayed. Hence, we need to see that the one accord among the saints and among the churches is crucial.</p>
