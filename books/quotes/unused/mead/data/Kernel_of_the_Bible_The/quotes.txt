[1]  In this series of messages we shall cover one central point the kernel of the Bible.
[2]  As a book of life, the Bible has a kernel, and within this kernel there is the life germ.
[3]  In order to know what the kernel of the Bible is, we need to consider Ephesians 1:9.
[4]  This verse says, Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself.
[5]  This verse speaks of the mystery of God s will.
[6]  If you were to ask the angels what the mystery of God s will is, they would answer that they do not know.
[7]  Verse 15 says, And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
[8]  In this verse we see a wonderful title of Christ, the seed of the woman.
[9]  God created man and placed him in front of the tree of life, but man fell.
[10]  Although we have Christ as the image of God, as our life, and as the One who destroys Satan, we do not have the church in the first three chapters of Genesis.
[11]  I can strongly testify that, as one who has returned to God, I am an Abel.
[12]  More than fifty years ago, I was far away from God.
[13]  In the last message we saw the kernel in Genesis, Christ and the church.
[14]  Christ is God s image, our life, and the One who destroyed the enemy.
[15]  In these matters we have the divinity of Christ, the humanity of Christ, and the redemption of Christ.
[16]  Today, we enjoy Christ s image, Christ s life, and Christ s work of destruction.
[17]  In the book of Exodus we see Christ as the delivering Angel, as the speaking Moses, and as the redeeming and nourishing lamb.
[18]  The house of Israel enjoyed all these aspects of Christ.
[19]  Many Christians hold the mistaken concept that God wants to dwell in heaven.
[20]  But the Bible reveals that God s desire is to dwell on earth.
[21]  He is not satisfied with His heavenly dwelling place; He desires to come down to earth.
[22]  When the tabernacle was set up, the children of Israel were one.
[23]  Just as the tabernacle had been set up, so they also had been built up into one people.
[24]  If we enjoy Christ, eat Christ, drink Christ, and take Christ into us, Christ will become our constituent.
[25]  CHAPTER THREE THE KERNEL FROM EXODUS TO FIRST KINGS
[26]  At the beginning of the book of Genesis we see one man bearing the image of God.
[27]  But at the end of the book of Exodus we see a corporate house filled with the glory of God.
[28]  God s intention in His creation of man was not simply to have man; it was to have a corporate house as His dwelling place on earth, a house that could be filled with His glory for His expression.
[29]  As the children of Israel were crossing the Red Sea, the armies of Egypt pursued them.
[30]  But the Angel of the Lord miraculously buried the armies of the Egyptians.
[31]  After we received Christ as our Redeemer, our life, and our nourishment, we crossed the Red Sea.
[32]  God did not want just a movable tabernacle in the wilderness; He needed an established temple in the good land.
[33]  The temple is also a type of the church.
[34]  The tabernacle was neither stationary nor permanent, but the temple was established.
[35]  In order to have such an established church, we must take Christ, not only as the manna, but also as the good land.
[36]  According to the record of the Old Testament, the children of Israel were in Egypt, they journeyed through the wilderness, and they entered into the good land.
[37]  When the Israelites were in a fallen state in Egypt, they were under God s judgment, they were under the bondage of the Egyptians, and they were permeated with the odor of garlic.
[38]  The judgment upon them was related to God s righteousness, their bondage was related to the Egyptians, and the odor of garlic was related to their living.
[39]  However, we still need to have the heavenly element added to us.
[40]  Although we have been redeemed, delivered, cleansed, and purified, all this is negative; we do not yet have anything positive.
[41]  Deuteronomy 8:9 says the good land is also a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.
[42]  Stones are for building, and a mountain signifies God s kingdom.
[43]  Christ is the stone that smites the nations, and the mountain is the kingdom of God.
[44]  AS THE CHOICE PORTION OF THE HARVEST GOD S CONCERN FOR MAN S EATING
[45]  For the sake of His economy, God is very concerned about man s eating.
[46]  Immediately after God created man, He did not give him a list of things to do and not to do.
[47]  Instead, He placed him in front of the tree of life and charged him concerning his eating, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it Gen 2:16-17 .
[48]  God did not command man to love his wife or to worship and serve God.
[49]  Now we need to consider the way to eat Christ as the produce of the good land.
[50]  The first thing we need to see is that the manna comes directly from God.
[51]  When I speak of the harvest of Christ, I mean the Christ you have sown, the Christ on whom you have labored, and the Christ you have reaped to be your harvest.
[52]  CHAPTER SIX EATING CHRIST AS THE SOLID FOOD ALLEGORIZING THE BIBLE
[53]  Many Christians say that we should not allegorize the Bible.
[54]  However, if we do not know how to allegorize the Bible, it will be a closed book to us, for the Bible is full of allegories.
[55]  We all know what it means to be limited.
[56]  Married life, for example, is a limitation and a restriction.
[57]  If you do not know how to allegorize the Bible, you will never know the secret of the Bible.
[58]  More than fifty years ago, I was taught that the Bible was inspired by God.
[59]  In order to eat Christ as the solid food, as the produce of the good land, we must firstly have a harvest.
[60]  The Lord has given us the land and the seed, and the rain is coming; however, He cannot give us a harvest.
[61]  GOD S CONCERN FOR THE UNITY OF HIS PEOPLE
[62]  Eventually, the unique place chosen by the Lord was Jerusalem.
[63]  No matter in what region an Israelite lived, he had to set aside the top tenth of his harvest and bring it at the set time to Jerusalem.
[64]  Although this practice may seem quite awkward to us, it was a test whether the Israelites would act according to their sight or according to God s sight, whether they would do things according to their choice or according to the Lord s choice.
[65]  Consider again the Lord s regulation regarding coming to His chosen place to worship Him with the top tenth of the harvest.
[66]  In Deuteronomy 12, 14, and 16 God said words such as, The place I shall choose, fifteen times.
[67]  In Deuteronomy 12:5 He said, But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose out of all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come.
[68]  Verse 11 of the same chapter says, Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord.
[69]  Nothing touches the Lord s heart as much as the recovery of the church life.
[70]  The Lord desires to recover the church life that He may have a people who have come out of every division, that He may have a place for His name and for His habitation, and that He may have the Holy of Holies in which and from which to speak to His people today.
[71]  We in the Lord s recovery can testify from our experience that we always have something of Christ to enjoy.
[72]  In order to have such an exhibition of Christ, we must do three things: first, we must have the harvest; second, we must come to the unique place God has chosen, not to a place of division or confusion; and third, when we come to the church meetings, the unique place, we must release our spirit.
[73]  In order to eat Christ as the choice portion of the harvest, we need three things: the harvest, the unique place chosen by God, and the release of our spirit.
[74]  We need to release our spirit so that Christ may be released.
[75]  When some Christians hear this, they will say, We never heard of such a thing as growing Christ.
[76]  The Christ by whom we live and with whom we live becomes our enjoyment.
[77]  I eat my Christ and bring the top portion of the Christ I have experienced to the church meetings.
[78]  After God had departed and returned to heaven, the children of Israel were scattered.
[79]  Some were carried away to Egypt, some to Syria, and the majority to Babylon.
[80]  The temple was destroyed, and all its vessels were carried away to Babylon and placed in the temple of Nebuchadnezzar s idols.
[81]  In the Bible there are two lines that run parallel to each other: the line of Babylon and the line of Jerusalem.
[82]  The second significance of Babylon is that it is related to idolatry.
[83]  History records that in Babel, built by Nimrod and his father, names of idols were on the bricks used to build the city.
[84]  It is one thing to see these matters; it is another thing to apply them.
[85]  Suppose two genuine Christian brothers, who both have a background in religion, come together for fellowship.
[86]  One asks the other what church he goes to.
[87]  In Romans 15:5 and 6 Paul says, Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus, that you may with one accord and with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[88]  We must live by Christ, live in Christ, live with Christ, work on Christ, grow Christ, reap Christ, harvest Christ, present Christ to God, serve Christ to others, and enjoy Christ in our homes and in the meetings.
[89]  We know nothing but Christ, we preach nothing but Christ, we teach nothing but Christ, we minister nothing but Christ, and we share nothing but Christ.
[90]  CHAPTER TEN BECOMING STONES FOR GOD S BUILDING THE TWO ASPECTS OF BABYLON
[91]  Revelation 17:4 says, And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and gilded with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the unclean things of her fornication.
[92]  According to this verse, the woman is gilded with gold, precious stone, and pearls, the very materials with which the New Jerusalem is built.
[93]  The church is not only the people of God, but also the wife of Christ.
[94]  With respect to Christ as our God, we must worship Him and Him alone.
[95]  In the building of the tabernacle there were no stones.
[96]  Gold signifies the nature of God, and wood denotes the humanity of Christ.
[97]  Hence, the tabernacle as the dwelling place of God was built with Christ s divinity and humanity.
[98]  In the Bible God s building begins with the tabernacle and consummates with the New Jerusalem.
[99]  In the tabernacle there were gold and wood, but no stone.
[100]  We need to experience all these aspects of Christ as the stone for God's building.
[101]  If we experience Him in these aspects, we shall have a complete building.
[102]  The fact that Christ is the foundation stone is not a doctrine; it is something that we must experience.
[103]  Apart from the church life, you cannot experience Christ as the foundation stone.
[104]  During the early days of the church life in Germany, you brothers probably did not have very much experience of Christ as the foundation stone.
[105]  The first thing we must do is to find out who Christ is and what Christ is.
[106]  Does it sound rather strange to speak of what Christ is?
[107]  Because Christ is so wonderful and all-inclusive, we must know not only who He is, but also what He is.
[108]  When we say that Christ is God and man, we are speaking of who Christ is.
[109]  But when we say that Christ is the light and the door, we are speaking of what Christ is.
[110]  As the Son, Christ is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15 .
[111]  CHAPTER TWELVE CHRIST IN HIS HUMANITY THE MEANING OF RECOVERY
[112]  Because we are in His recovery, we must know what the word recovery means.
[113]  To be recovered is to be brought back by the Lord to the beginning.
[114]  Most Christians have the Lord Jesus only as their Redeemer and Savior; they do not have Christ as their everything.
[115]  Some have Christ in name, and others have Christ in doctrine; however, they do not have Christ in His all-inclusiveness and the complete, pure, living Word.
[116]  When I speak of the experience of Christ, I refer to the eating of Christ, the enjoyment of Christ as our food and our life supply, the partaking of Christ as our daily enjoyment.
[117]  In the foregoing message, we saw seven matters relating to Christ s divinity.
[118]  We saw that Christ is God, the Creator, the Lord, Jehovah, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[119]  If we have the Son we also have the Father.
[120]  First Corinthians 15:47 says, The second man is the Lord from heaven.
[121]  Here we see that Christ is the second man.
[122]  In the eyes of God there are just two men: the first man, Adam, and the second man, Christ.
[123]  Hebrews 2:10 reveals that Christ is the Captain of our salvation.
[124]  Many Christians have no experience of Christ as their Captain.
[125]  Hence, we in the Lord s recovery need to experience Him in this aspect.
[126]  Christ is not only our Savior; He is our Captain, and we are His army.
[127]  His Person has two aspects, the divine aspect and the human aspect.
[128]  In theology the study of Christ s Person is known as Christology.
[129]  Since the second century, Christian teachers have argued concerning the Person of Christ.
[130]  If we follow a teaching regarding Christ s Person that is not according to the Bible, we shall be in difficulty.
[131]  Now in this message we need to consider thirty-five items of what Christ is.
[132]  When we say that Christ is the Word, we are not speaking of who Christ is, but of what Christ is.
[133]  Although no one knows God, Christ as the Word speaks for God, defines God, and even declares God.
[134]  In John 4:14 He says, Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.
[135]  As we all know, Christ is the bread of life typified by manna John 6:35 .
[136]  The more you love Christ, eat Christ, live by Christ, and fellowship with Christ, the more He will be the wide open door through which you may walk out of religion, out of the denominations, out of every kind of fold.
[137]  John 12:24 reveals that Christ fell into the earth as a grain of wheat and died so that He might bring forth many grains.
[138]  By His death as the Lamb, He took away our sin; as the brass serpent, He destroyed the devil; and as the grain of wheat, He produced many grains to form the loaf, which is the church.
[139]  If you do not know how to contact God, take Christ as your way.
[140]  First Corinthians 10:4 also says, They drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.
[141]  He has been cleft for us, and out of Him flows the living water for our drinking.
[142]  Of course, the Christ here is not the individual Christ; it is the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ.
[143]  Although we may have the riches of Christ, it is possible to have them merely in an objective way.
[144]  The riches may simply be the riches and yet not have anything to do with us.
[145]  To know the riches of Christ objectively is one thing; to enjoy them subjectively is another.
[146]  We must learn how to eat all the aspects of Christ revealed in the Gospel of John, 1 Corinthians, and the other books of the Bible.
[147]  The second verse of chapter one says, Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours Gk.
[148]  The church built by Christ will bring in the kingdom.
[149]  Verse 18 speaks of the church, and verse 19, of the kingdom.
[150]  Verse 19 says, And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
[151]  In Matthew 28:19, the Lord revealed the way to build up the church: Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit Gk.
[152]  But in Matthew 28 baptism is not a ritual; it is the immersing of the believers of Christ into the Triune God.
[153]  Inwardly the believers were filled with the Spirit of life and outwardly they were immersed into the Spirit.
[154]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE WAY TO PRODUCE THE CHURCH IMMERSED INTO THE TRIUNE GOD
[155]  Baptizing believers in water signifies that they are being immersed into the Triune God Matt 28:19 .
[156]  We were born outside of God and we have drifted far away from Him.
[157]  One day we heard the gospel, and the gospel brought us back to Him.
[158]  Whenever we baptize believers into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, we are placing them into the Triune God.
[159]  After we have been baptized, we have not only come back to God and belong to Him; we are also in Him.
[160]  When we are baptized into Christ, we are put into Christ, and we put Christ upon us.
[161]  The church is not something outside the Triune God.
[162]  Neither is the church merely a group of believers who meet together.
[163]  It is not an organization; it is a constitution with Christ and of Christ.
[164]  The church is produced by immersing the believers into the Triune God, by their receiving the resurrected Christ as their life, content, and constitution, and by the pouring out of the ascended Christ upon them to cause them to be wholly and thoroughly filled with the Triune God and immersed into Him.
[165]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST
[166]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord Jesus prophesied that He would build His church.
[167]  Following that, in the book of Acts the Lord gave us a pattern by which we can clearly see how He produces and builds His church.
[168]  They see that Christ was the Word of God; that, as the Word, He became flesh; that when He was crucified on the cross, as the Lamb of God, He took away our sins; that He was resurrected; that He has ascended to the heavens, where He is now seated on the throne of God; and that He is coming again.
[169]  On the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ on the throne poured Himself out as the Spirit of power upon these one hundred twenty believers.
[170]  Thus, the one hundred twenty disciples passed through three stages: first, they were brought back to God and baptized into Him; second, the resurrected Christ as the Spirit of life was breathed into them; and third, the ascended Christ as the Spirit of power was poured out upon them.
[171]  Within, they had the resurrected Christ as life; and without, they had the ascended Christ as power.
[172]  They had the resurrected Christ as their inward content, and they had the ascended Christ as their outward equipment.
[173]  The church is a group of believers who have been brought back to God and baptized into Him, who have had the resurrected Christ as the Spirit of life breathed into them to be their content, and who also have the ascended Christ poured out upon them as their power and equipment.
[174]  The church is made up of Christians who are praising, singing, and declaring that they are in the Triune God, that they have the resurrected Christ within them, and that they have the ascended Christ upon them.
[175]  The church can be the Body of Christ only by being constituted with those who are in the Triune God, who have Christ in them as their content, and who have Christ upon them as their equipment.
[176]  Ephesians 1:22 and 23 reveal that the church, the Body, is the fullness of Christ.
[177]  This term, the fullness of Christ, is deep and difficult to understand.
[178]  The book of Ephesians reveals that the church is also the new man Eph 2:15; 4:24 .
[179]  Very few Christians, even Christian teachers, have seen that the church is the new man.
[180]  . Out of two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, Christ created a new man.
[181]  One day a sister told me about a Brethren assembly in Vancouver, British Columbia, that was divided over the matter of using a piano and organ in the meetings.
[182]  One group was in favor of the organ, but not the piano, and the other group favored the piano, but not the organ.
[183]  By giving these illustrations I simply wish to point out our need to drop all the ordinances.
[184]  If some saints desire to speak in tongues, give them that liberty.
[185]  Although you may not like it, you should not stop them.
[186]  Although today s situation is so pitiful, by the Lord s mercy we have been recovered.
[187]  In this message we come to the book of Revelation, the consummation of the Bible.
[188]  In the preceding messages we have followed the line of the kernel of the Bible.
[189]  Firstly we saw that in the book of Genesis God gained a transformed Israel.
[190]  Today many Christians are talking about the church, the Body.
[191]  Today, at the end of this age, there is need for the recovery of the churches.
[192]  There needs to be a church in Rome and in every major city in Europe.
[193]  Some may wonder how we can be used by the Lord for the spread of the churches.
[194]  The only way is to consecrate yourself every morning and every evening, day after day.
[195]  Again and again you need to pray, Lord Jesus, I consecrate myself to You.
[196]  The Bible ends with the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2 .
[197]  This means that New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of all the positive things in the Bible.
[198]  One day, because man had fallen, the creating God became the redeeming God.
[199]  The seed of the woman is simply the redeeming God, God becoming the seed of woman to redeem us.
[200]  The basic element of the city proper is gold.
[201]  As we have pointed out, this city is a mountain of gold.
[202]  Revelation 21:11 also says that New Jerusalem has the glory of God.
[203]  Both inside and outside, New Jerusalem is filled with glory.
[204]  Hence, in New Jerusalem we have regeneration, a holy walk, transformation, building, the appearance of God, and the full manifestation of God.
[205]  In the New Testament there are three verses that speak of both the human spirit and the divine Spirit.
[206]  John 3:6 says that our spirit is born of the divine Spirit; John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit; and Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.
[207]  The third verse concerning the two spirits is Romans 8:16.
[208]  This verse says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[209]  Here we see that the divine Spirit witnesses with our human spirit.
[210]  The first three verses we have covered on the Spirit, John 3:6, John 4:24, Romans 8:16, make up one group; and the next three verses, 1 Corinthians 15:45, 2 Corinthians 3:17, and 1 Corinthians 6:17, make up a second group.
[211]  Now we need to consider a third group of verses regarding the Spirit, Galatians 5:16 and Romans 8:4-6.
