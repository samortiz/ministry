<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO PRAY<br />
BY EXERCISING THEIR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The condition in Christianity is that most people go to &ldquo;church&rdquo; on Sunday in order to sit and listen to a sermon, and then they leave when the sermon is over. They do not pray in the meeting, and they rarely pray during the week. Even if they pray, their prayers are merely petitions based on their thoughts and memory. Since they do not know how to turn to their spirit and how to exercise their spirit to fellowship with God, they do not pray when they come to a meeting. This is even the situation of the saints among us. They listen to the message during the meeting, but they do not exercise their spirit. We need to correct this situation. As we lead the brothers and sisters to be built up as the church, we cannot depend on outward arrangements. Rather, we must lead the brothers and sisters to turn to their spirit and to live before God so that their spirit becomes strong and living. When all the saints are blended in spirit, there will be genuine building.</p>
<p>We need to help the brothers and sisters become strong and living by leading them to turn to their spirit to pray and fellowship with God, serving as priests and living a priestly life. As long as they know how to turn to their spirit to pray, they will not be hindered by occasional sins, mistakes, or other problems. Instead, the Spirit will move and flow in them to deal with their inward weaknesses and to relieve their weariness, enabling them to receive the supply from God. With a strong and released spirit, they will blend as one in spirit with other brothers and sisters in the church. We should not emphasize giving more messages but focus on motivating the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit.</p>
<p>We must bear this responsibility together. It does not matter who gives messages, who visits others, or who contacts people in the meetings, because we have a common goal of bringing the saints into the spirit, into the experience and reality of fellowshipping with God. This is a new beginning for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENRICHING THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>Our bread-breaking meetings lack a spiritual supply because the saints are short of spiritual knowledge. Although some do not exercise their spirits, many other brothers and sisters are short of words of prayer, praise, and thanksgiving because they are short in matters related to knowing the Lord. The fact that our prayers and praises are nearly the same for every bread-breaking meeting shows that we are short in our knowledge of the Lord. Without a rich understanding of the things related to the Lord, there will be a shortage in our utterance. If we are short of utterance, it will be difficult to release our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Increasing the Spiritual Supply<br />
according to the Truth</h2>
<p>We need to increase the spiritual supply in the saints by helping them to know the Lord Jesus and the Father according to the truth. The Lord Jesus is the central subject of the Bible, but when we read the Bible, we often do not have much light, and the words that pass before our eyes are quickly forgotten. However, when the truth is released through the ministry of the word, and the Spirit enlightens us inwardly, something solid enters into us and leaves a deep impression. We should supply the saints with messages related to knowing the Lord Jesus and the Father according to the truth. This will enrich the praise and thanksgiving in our bread-breaking meeting, especially when we worship the Father.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the saints, we will provide a message outline to the responsible brothers and sisters so that they can spend time before the Lord considering, praying, and digesting these points in order to be able to fellowship with the saints in the &ldquo;classes.&rdquo; The saints need to know the truth so that they can be brought into a practice and exercise that is according to the truth. We should print the crucial verses and the main points, and we could even add some prayers. This does not mean that we are asking the saints to repeat the prayers as if they are reading a prayer book; rather, it is to give them some examples so that they can exercise before the Lord at home and in their daily living. This is a consideration to help the ones who are new in their spiritual life and limited in their spiritual knowledge. Providing them with Bible verses and crucial points will surely be a great help to them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Spiritual Supply<br />
through Hymns</h2>
<p>In addition to increasing the spiritual supply in the bread-breaking meeting, we should also strengthen the spiritual supply through hymns, especially hymns related to the worship of the Father. Because we are short in spiritual knowledge and spiritual exercise, our worship of the Father is weak and not much praise is offered to Him. This is a great lack among us. I hope that we would have more hymns to supply the bread-breaking meeting. Although we have quite a number of hymns that are suitable for the bread-breaking meeting, we have lost the taste for some of our hymns because we sing them all the time. This can be likened to eating the same food every day. Even if we eat the best food, the food will lose its &ldquo;freshness&rdquo; and become tasteless if we eat it every day.</p>
<p>The Lord is always moving forward. In every age He leads the church, and His leading brings in a new atmosphere. Presently, the Lord is bringing in a new atmosphere. If we continue to sing the same hymns, they will not always be suitable. Recently in a bread-breaking meeting, a brother led the saints to sing a new hymn, but because we were not familiar with the hymn, we could not sing it. At the same time, we could not go back to the old hymns because the atmosphere was different. This shows that we need a supply of new hymns, and we also need to practice singing these hymns.</p>
