<h2 class="head1">HOW TO TEACH THE SAINTS BY THE TRUTH LESSONS</h2>
<p>We also need to fellowship how to teach the saints by the truth lessons. We must use the Lord&rsquo;s Day or what is popularly called Sunday since this day is generally a holiday throughout the earth. Most people do not have to work on Sunday, so we must utilize this day to teach the truths to the saints. We must take this way to educate the saints. I would propose that every church spend half of every Lord&rsquo;s Day on the matter of teaching the truth. Every Lord&rsquo;s Day morning we may have a general meeting to take care of the &ldquo;Sunday goers&rdquo; and general attendants. At the same time and on the same day, if possible in the same building, you must set up classes to teach the truth. The best way is to ask the saints to register for the level they would like to be in based upon their discernment. When they come to the meeting the next week, they should go to the level they have signed up for. If they have some new ones with them, they could bring them to the general meeting, and then they themselves could go to the particular class for which they have registered.</p>
<p>In the same building you could have four classes to teach the truth and a general meeting. If there is a need, you could set up a gospel preaching meeting. Use the entire morning of the Lord&rsquo;s Day to teach the saints the truth. The general meeting also comprises a part of the teaching of the truth in a kind of preaching way. The saints who are the interested seekers of the truth and who are not merely the Sunday goers have to get themselves registered into different levels of the truth lessons. The leading ones should set up classes and arrange to have some teachers for these classes. This is the best way to promote the function of the saints.</p>
<p>In a certain locality there may only be fifty saints. But they could be divided into two or three classes for the truth lessons. Each class needs one teacher with a helper. You may have thirty or more in one class, and the teaching of the lesson should only occupy fifty to sixty minutes. After the teaching of the lesson, the class should be divided into small groups of no more than ten. The less in the small group the better. Two saints are needed to take care of each group. They need to sit down with the members of the group to discuss the lesson which they have all covered. There is no need for a detailed discussion, but these two saints should check with the ones in the group to find out what they understood and to give them time to ask some questions. They need to help the ones in the group to become more impressed with all the points of the lesson.</p>
<p>One truth lesson covers many points, so there is no time to develop a point. One particular teacher of a truth class spent a lot of time in one lesson discussing Cain. After he finished this discussion, much of the time was gone. The Life-study messages are full of the expounding and development of particular points. When we came to the matter of the pillar in Genesis, we spent a number of messages to develop this point. However, the truth lessons are another matter. Every lesson is really a message.</p>
<p>We should teach the students in the class by first asking them to open up their copy of the truth lessons and read. Every member of the class can read a phrase or a sentence of the text in a spontaneous and living way. They should not read the lesson in the same way that they would read a newspaper. While they read the teacher should stress the main points to impress them with the contents of that lesson. You do not need to explain, expound, or develop. If someone asks you who Cain is, it is sufficient to tell them that he was the first son of Adam. Do not go further. If someone would continue to ask you something else, you may need to say, &ldquo;That is not in the lesson.&rdquo; The lesson is quite limited to impress us with all the major points. In the teaching of the truth lessons there is no chance for the one who teaches to show how much he knows. He is only charged to speak this message as a lesson with all the people in the class. I believe that in approximately fifty minutes a teacher can do a good job to impress the ones in his class with the truth of the lesson.</p>
<p>The questions at the end of each truth lesson are for discussion after the lesson is given. They are not for homework. The students need to be impressed with the points covered in that one lesson. Only go as far as the text of the truth lessons with the accompanying questions to impress the saints with the main points. When a math teacher in elementary school is teaching students addition, he does not go beyond his lesson to get into something deeper or higher. Otherwise, he breaks the teaching principle. If the first lesson only requires the students to add the first four numbers, the teacher should just impress them with that much. This is the best way of teaching. Do not talk about anything other than what the lesson teaches. Do not add anything that would cause them to forget what they should be impressed with. Just impress them with the very things that the lesson teaches. Then you are a good teacher.</p>
