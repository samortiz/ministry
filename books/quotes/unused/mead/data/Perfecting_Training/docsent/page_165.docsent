   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE THINGS OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The things of the flesh also are related to our living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are so many items related to the flesh because you are a person living in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you are a person living in the flesh, your clothing is of the flesh, your eating is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even your lodging is of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whatever you do and whatever you have is of the flesh because you are just a person living in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The food for one who lives in the spirit becomes a thing of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the same food may become the food of the flesh because you are a person living in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of your living, the things which are related to you are affected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you are living in the flesh, everything that is related to you becomes flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The mind of the flesh is not mainly for business but for living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The matter of enmity with God is a matter of living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You don t have peace with God; you have something just the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You have a kind of enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This enmity is not mainly related to schooling, business, jobs, or renting or buying a house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is mainly related to living, to your daily life before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>SMALL PERSONS EXPRESSING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then there is the matter of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God intended to have our body as an organ to express what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God did not intend so much that our body be an organ to accomplish great things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Actually, according to the Bible, God doesn t want any giants.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God wants a lot of small persons to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever a person becomes great, there is a big possibility for him to be ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To remain in a situation and condition of being a small person is your protection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is your safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many great persons on this earth have been ruined by their greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If they are strong in the will they may make up their mind to preserve themselves, but not for God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is just for their dignity, for their kind of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Small persons like ourselves are protected from corruption and from being ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are protected from being dignified and from being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are preserved in our condition of being small just to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God doesn t want people to be great, to be dignified, to be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God wants human beings to be small persons who live Him and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Don t try to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Don t desire to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to attract people to Him and give glory to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God doesn t care for our enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God only cares for our humble living as a small person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He was never made great.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He never tried to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He always remained in His smallness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The New Testament doesn t teach us to be successful in enterprises or in activities.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many consider that Paul was the greatest Apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if you read the New Testament, it seems he didn t succeed in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Firstly, he was arrested and put into prison; then he was martyred.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even before he was martyred he said that all of Asia had forsaken him 2 Tim 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means all the saints in the churches in Asia had rejected Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I never saw Brother Watchman Nee trying to be great.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We who had gotten much help from him always expected he could do a bigger work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But eventually the Lord let him stay in prison for twenty years where he died.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But there was a life lived out by such a low and small man that gave glory to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That expressed the very God whom we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Romans 8 there is no hint that would help you know the leading of God concerning your big enterprise.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are seeking for this kind of leading you will be fully disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How then could you know where you should go to school?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How can you know what major you should take?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is by living in the spirit all the day.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is by living under the leading by the Spirit all the day.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then spontaneously you would know.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This matter of the leading becomes a kind of habitual thing in your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It could never be a kind of accident which happens all of a sudden.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>No! there is not such a leading by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The leading by the Spirit is a matter of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is something spoken from the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now let us look at the positive side.</S>
