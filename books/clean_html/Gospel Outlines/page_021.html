<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S CALLING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 12<br />
This subject covers the calling of Abraham.</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>God&rsquo;s purpose in man<br />
<span class="normal">Do not say this too heavily. Point out that God has a purpose in man. Man is not meaningless in the universe, but the purpose of God is with him.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s fall<br />
<span class="normal">Do not say too much. Briefly say that man has fallen from God&rsquo;s purpose and has lost God&rsquo;s purpose.</span></li>
<li>Man&rsquo;s real situation<br />
<span class="normal">Using the tower of Babel as a background, tell how the people of that time lived a godless life and how they worshipped idols. Then describe how people today are living a godless life, and how they also are building a tower of Babel and a city of Babel.</span></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s calling
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>While men were building the city and the tower of Babel, God came to call men to return to His original purpose.</li>
	<li>In what way does God call? He calls by His gospel. Today the gospel preaching is God&rsquo;s calling.</li>
	<li>How does God call?
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>He wants men to repent. To repent is to turn your heart to God. Formerly your thinking was a godless thinking, and your living was a godless living. Now you must change your mind and turn to God.</li>
		<li>He wants men to believe and receive Him.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Answering God&rsquo;s call<br />
<span class="normal">Since you have spoken of repentance and believing in the preceding section, here you need to cover only three minor points.</span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Teach the new ones to pray and confess.</li>
	<li>Help them to believe God&rsquo;s words.</li>
	<li>Help them make the decision to live for God. (Don&rsquo;t consider this as something that is too deep.) There are three words which summarize a complete salvation:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Conviction.</li>
		<li>Conversion.</li>
		<li>Consecration.<br />
		<em>In every gospel preaching you should lead the new ones to consecration. In the Old Testament picture, the people of Israel were consecrated as soon as the Passover was finished. If you have a five-day gospel conference, the last day should be used to cover the matter of consecration. This is like Peter&rsquo;s salvation. Peter repented and was saved, and then he left everything and followed Jesus. This is consecration.</em></li>
