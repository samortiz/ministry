 <h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENED BY THE SPIRIT INTO THE INNER MAN<br />
THAT CHRIST MAY MAKE HIS HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>If we are living by the Spirit of life and walking by the mingled spirit, we will be strengthened by the Spirit into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts (Eph. 3:16-17a). We need to be strengthened into our regenerated spirit, which is our inner man. When we live by ourselves, we are very strong in our mind. We may say that we do not have any time to pray, but we have much time to talk on the telephone. The telephone is very sticky to many of us, especially the sisters. Once they get on the phone, it is hard for them to get off. We like to talk much and we pray so little because we are too strong in our mind and emotions. But we need to be strong in our inner man, strong in our spirit. When we are strong in our spirit, we like to pray, and we will pray. We pray because we are strengthened into our inner man. Often we are outside of the inner man. We have to get back to the inner man, but we cannot make it by ourselves. This is why Paul prayed for us.</p>
<p>Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 3 was not only for the Ephesians but also for all the saints throughout all the generations, including you and me. If we had the attitude that the Epistles were written only to those to whom they were addressed, then none of the Epistles would be for us. This would mean that the Bible is not for us. This reasoning is illogical. Paul&rsquo;s first Epistle to the Corinthians is addressed not only to the church in Corinth but also to all the believers in every place who call upon the name of the Lord (1 Cor. 1:2). Since we are calling on the name of the Lord, 1 Corinthians was written to us. Furthermore, Paul charged the Colossians to cause his letter to them to be read by the Laodiceans, and he also told the Colossians to read the letter that he had written to the Laodiceans (Col. 4:16). It is clear that any book written in the New Testament was written to all the saints through all the generations. Thank the Lord that Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 3 is for us. To take this prayer is to receive a great blessing. The Apostle Paul prayed for us. He bowed his knees to the Father that the Father would grant us to be strengthened into the inner man that Christ might make His home in our hearts. For the Father to grant us this request is His giving us mercy. The Father strengthens us through a channel, the Spirit. Actually, the consummated Spirit does the work of strengthening us.</p>
<p>In some of the church or conference meetings we may have been very excited. But later we may become weak, down, and disappointed. We may be like a flat tire. When we are weak, down, or disappointed, suddenly something begins to strengthen us. This strengthening One is the consummated Spirit. He strengthens us because the Father is still answering Paul&rsquo;s prayer. When we are being inwardly strengthened we need to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Now my Father is answering my brother&rsquo;s, the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s, prayer for me.&rdquo; When you are disappointed and you are suddenly strengthened from within, do you think this is an accident? It is not an accident. It is the answer of the Father to the Apostle Paul. He is answering Paul by granting you, giving you mercy, to be strengthened through His Spirit, the consummated Spirit, into the inner man. When we are like a flat tire, He comes in to pump us up, to strengthen us. We may be like a flat tire one minute, but the next minute we may be strong. One minute ago we may have been weeping, but the next minute we may be saying, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Hallelujah, Christ is Victor!&rdquo; We Christians fluctuate frequently. Our weeping may turn to laughter and our sighing into praising. This is because the Father is answering the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s prayer in Ephesians 3.</p>
<p>Being strengthened into our inner man is with a purpose&mdash;that Christ may make His home in our hearts. The heart is like a house with four big rooms&mdash;the mind, the emotion, the will, and the conscience. Christ wants to settle down in all of these rooms, to make His home in our hearts. To make His home in our hearts is to take us over. When I was a young believer, I remember declaring and feeling that I fully belonged to Jesus and that He fully belonged to me. But when I look back to when I was young, I can realize that Jesus did not have the way to take me over. Many of the young people among us love the Lord and belong to Him, but actually Jesus does not have the way to take them over, to possess them, and to occupy them. When a person buys a house, he takes it over. This means that he possesses the house, moves in, and occupies every room. Does Christ have the full way to occupy your mind, your emotion, your will, and your conscience? You may tell the Lord that you love Him and belong to Him, but does He have the way to take your whole being over, to possess every part of your inner being, to occupy every room of your heart? Does He have the full freedom and way to move into the room of your mind, the room of your emotion, the room of your will, and the room of your conscience? The Lord knows. Christ desires to occupy us not in a general way but in a particular way. He wants to occupy every room of our inner house. When He makes His home in our hearts, we will be able to apprehend His dimensions and know His knowledge-surpassing love that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God (3:18-19).</p>
