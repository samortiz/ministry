<h2 class="head1">THE NEED TO BE STRICT AND DESPERATE<br />IN GOD'S WORK</h2><p>James Yen: For the past few months I have not learned anything. My personal walk and my work in the past have been merely a kind of outward pursuit. As our brother pointed out in Kuling, I only have a kind of emotional appreciation; there is no real consecration. When I am not working, I fall into passivity and laziness; but when I work, I am condemned. What is the way to my deliverance?</p><p>Watchman Nee: My advice is for you to keep on working, because the more you hold yourself back, the more there will be leaks and holes. The real lessons a person learns do not come from retreats or "spiritual" meditation; a man cannot wait until he has improved before joining the Lord's work. It never works this way. If we want to wait until we have reached a certain standard, we may find that we have less and less in our hands as time goes on. We advance by learning and working from our present position; we do not attain a certain standard and then begin to work. I hope that you can be desperate. Forget about the feeling of condemnation. If you look at yourself you will leak and drift further. You must not wait. Once you wait, you become more lax. You have to gird up yourself. Everyone who was used by God in the past centuries was a strict person. There should not be any lethargy in the Lord's work.</p><p>Brother Ke-san is responsible for the work in Foochow. Some do not feel happy about this. They even ask, "Why has he been appointed as a responsible one?" He has his virtues, however. He never stops or rests. He is very strict with himself. While others fall, he remains standing. We all know that his physical health is not good. We may apply the clich√©, "He does not have enough food to last another day," to others, but with him we can say, "He does not have enough energy to last another day." He is a man whose energy does not extend beyond the day. He works beyond his own measure; nevertheless, it is because of him that the leadership in the Fukien region has been established in the past year.</p><p>Brother Witness is also strict. It is not easy for him to be knocked down. He is willing to pay the price, to be desperate, and to not spare himself. He often says that a man cannot make the excuse that his health is poor. Whatever he wants to do and whatever he says he will do, he always gets done. If one way does not work, he finds another way. He is so desperate that he is not discouraged by anything.</p><p>I advise you to learn from these two brothers. Apply yourself to the work in a desperate way. Do not wait. The more you wait, the emptier you will become.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING STRICT IN THE WORK<br />AND RELAXED IN FEELINGS</h2><p>Mrs. Yen: The Lord has opened the way for me to do more visitation recently, but I feel that I do not have any co-worker to coordinate with me. Various limitations in the environment and a sense of inadequacy within have limited me from rendering much practical help to others. When I do not visit, I feel condemned. When I do visit, I feel very weak. Recently, I have seen that I am short of obedience. I love to argue and reason, and every time I argue and reason, I find myself unable to submit.</p><p>Watchman Nee: Your condition requires two different dealings. What I mean is this: In conducting your work you have to be strict, but in dealing with your feelings you have to be relaxed. If you become tense in your feelings, you will bring suffering to yourself. If this frigidity is pushed to the extreme, no one will be able to touch you. When a rubber band is not fully stretched, there is room for more stretching, and it does not give any noise when plucked. If it is fully stretched, however, it will make a sharp noise the minute it is touched. No one will be able to stretch it further; it will break immediately.</p><p>Since the Kuling training, it has become manifest that you are a person who reacts quickly. You have to learn to trust in God and believe in Him. When something happens, do not be anxious. Do not worry too much and do not consider too much. You also must help Brother Yen be more strict in the work and less tense in feelings. When feelings become too tense, our endurance goes down, and our capacity for more burden is reduced.</p><p>What is endurance? In the world endurance is expressed in an inward stiffness and outward stoicism toward the slightest stretching. But true endurance leaves more ground for inward stretching by men or by the environment. If you are too full of your own feelings, you will not have room to accommodate others. You have wasted too much of your feelings on yourself and have left nothing for others. If you can be more reserved in your feelings and do not use them all up, you will find it easy to endure.</p>
