         <h2 class="head2">Contacting the Bible<br />
Being to Contact the Spirit</h2>
<p>To contact the Bible is to contact the Spirit of God. Christians should not be superstitious, but when we contact the Bible, we must be focused in our concept, feeling, and attitude to realize that we are contacting the Spirit. Without such an attitude, it will not be easy for us to touch the essence of the Bible. Similarly, when we contact food, it is with the intention of eating it. Without such a focus, we will not eat the food. Hence, our focus is important.</p>
<p>Every time we come to the Bible, we must ask ourselves whether we want to study the Bible or to contact it. If our purpose is to study the Bible, we will learn the elements, but if our purpose is to contact the Bible, we will touch the Spirit of God. Most of the people who read the Bible only study the elements in the Bible. By God&rsquo;s mercy, many times when we study the Bible, we touch the Spirit of God with our spirit. We can say that sometimes we &ldquo;stumbled upon&rdquo; the Spirit. This may not be a good illustration, but the principle is correct. Initially, we were studying the elements of the Bible; we had no intention of contacting the Spirit. But while we were studying, the Spirit of God touched our spirit. The Spirit can be found in the Bible; hence, when we contact the Bible, we contact the Spirit. Very few believers are clear concerning this matter. On the one hand, we need to study the Bible, and on the other hand, we need to touch the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL EXERCISES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Building Up the Habit of Contacting the Spirit</h2>
<p>Many children of God cannot discern the difference between studying the Bible and touching the Bible. Most believers merely read the Bible; they do not know that the purpose of reading the Bible is for them to contact and touch the Bible. We are intentionally using this word <em>contact.</em> Some believers may argue that reading the Bible is the same as contacting the Bible. In our use, we are saying that contacting the Bible is different from reading the Bible. To read something is to study it, but to contact something is to touch it so that it may operate in us. What believers refer to as studying the Bible may be likened to studying the nutritional content of food. What we refer to as contacting the Bible may be compared to eating a meal. Studying the Bible is entirely different from contacting the Bible.</p>
<p>We need to consider how much we contact the Bible. If we had not received particular leading, over ninety percent of the time we would only read and study the Bible. Do we open the Bible because we want to contact the Spirit or because we want to study the Bible? I am afraid that we rarely open the Bible in order to contact the Spirit. We need to learn to contact the Bible. Whenever we come to the Bible, we must have the concept that we are coming to contact the Spirit of God. We must exercise in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dropping the Desire to Understand</h2>
<p>In order to contact the Bible, we must drop the desire to understand it. Initially, this may not be easy, because we have a habit of studying it. If we would open the Bible for the sake of contacting it rather than studying it, we would be delivered. For this reason we need to practice. If we can learn this secret and practice it, our Bible-reading will gradually become profitable. As soon as we contact the Bible, we will also contact the Spirit. Some may ask how they can understand the Bible without studying and researching it. This is to fall victim to the notion of wanting to understand. We think that we cannot receive inspiration if we do not understand the Bible. If we would practice contacting the Bible, we would realize that, in fact, our understanding of the Bible comes from inspiration. When we read the Bible, we should not focus on understanding it. We must drop this concept.</p>
<p>This fellowship may seem contradictory because reading the Bible helps you to understand it, yet you are being told not to focus on understanding what you read. How do we explain this? Every time we come to the Bible, we should reject the desire to merely understand, because this desire will hinder us from touching the Spirit. We should not fear our inability to understand the Bible. At a certain point in time, we will gain a genuine understanding. We must drop the concept of merely wanting to understand the Bible. When we are invited to a rich feast, we should simply eat and drink and enjoy the food that is set before us. We should not analyze the food. We need to be delivered when we read the Bible. When we open the Bible, we must have the concept, focus, and desire to contact the Spirit of God. We must be so foolish that if we understand something when we read the Bible, we would say, &ldquo;Lord, even though I understand, I still want to contact Your Spirit.&rdquo; If we are willing to spend the time and practice reading the Bible in this way, we will discover that it is very beneficial.</p>
<p>Not many saints have the practice of touching the Bible. We cannot avoid the term <em>reading the Bible,</em> but we must change our practice. Formerly, we read the Bible as if we were reading a chemistry textbook. It is not easy for us to drop the concept of studying and researching the Bible. We need to be corrected in this matter.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coming with the Spirit<br />
and Learning to Use the Spirit</h2>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must use our spirit more than our mind, because our intention is to contact the Spirit. God is Spirit, and He needs us to touch Him with our spirit. Our heart and mind are also involved with reading the Bible, but the primary matter is to use our spirit. When some brothers read the Bible, they use only their mind but not their heart; that is, they do not love to read the Word of God, nor do they have a heart to receive His words. Hence, they read the Bible like someone who is reading a newspaper. Other brothers use not only their mind but also their heart. They love God&rsquo;s words, take delight in His words, want to hear His words, receive His words, and are willing to pay a price to enjoy His words. However, they do not know how to exercise their spirit. As a result, they do not receive the supply of life from the Bible. Even after reading the Bible many times, these ones can receive only teachings concerning improving their behavior; they cannot touch the words of life.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, we must learn the lesson of using not only our mind and our heart but also our spirit. In other words, we should contact the Bible with our spirit. When we come to the Word of God, we are coming to Him; hence, we must have a spirit of worship and not merely a sincere heart. God is Spirit, and we must worship Him in spirit. This means that we should not use only our mind or our zeal. God&rsquo;s words are spirit; hence, we must exercise to not rely solely on our ability to comprehend and learn but, instead, contact His words with a spirit of worship. This requires exercise.</p>
<p>If we would exercise our spirit when we come to the Word, then even if we read only half a chapter, our spirit will touch the Spirit in the Word. By contacting God in this way for ten or twenty minutes, our inner being will be refreshed, illuminated, strengthened, and satisfied. This is the result of touching the Spirit of God. As serving ones who desire to receive something from the Bible, we should spend some time to practice so that the Bible becomes our food and our supply. This is the most precious aspect of the Bible. It is also true that the light and truth in the Bible supply our mind. This is another aspect. </p>
<p>The Spirit of God is located in the words of the Bible. Hence, our primary purpose in contacting the Bible is to contact the Spirit. For this reason, when we come to the Bible, we must reject our desire to merely comprehend, and instead, we must use our spirit to contact the words of God. When we use our spirit to touch His words, we contact the Spirit. As a result of this kind of contact, we receive holiness, power, love, and comfort. These can be compared to the fruit produced after a seed is planted in the soil. Such fruit is not the issue of teaching but the result of the growth of life. Such fruit is the result of our spirit touching not only the words of God but also the Spirit of God, because His words are spirit and life.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
