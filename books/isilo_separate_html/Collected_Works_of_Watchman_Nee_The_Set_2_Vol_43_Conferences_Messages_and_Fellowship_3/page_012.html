We also saw that man has two kinds of sins: One is a power within which causes man to commit sins; the other is the outward acts of sins. The power of sin within causes man to sin; the outward acts of sins bring man into judgment. The sin within is the cause of man's perdition, while the sins without are the cause of God's righteous judgment. Because man has committed sins outwardly, he needs to be saved, and because he possesses the inward sin, he needs to overcome. Because of the many sins without, man needs to be justified before God, and because of the inward sin which compels him to sin, man needs to be sanctified within. These two kinds of sins are different in operation. God wants to save man. But in order for Him to accomplish a full salvation, He needs to deal with the sin that is within as well as the sins that are without. If God only dealt with the outward sins, man's salvation would be incomplete. The outward sins of Christians have been forgiven by the blood of Christ. Yet the inward power of sin still remains. If you ask such a Christian, "Have your sins been forgiven?" He will answer, "Yes, my sins have all been forgiven." But every day he will continue to sin. After he sins, he will come back to ask for forgiveness. This is because he has only received a half salvation. He has not yet obtained a full salvation.</p><p>If a man is ignorant of himself and does not know who he is, he will look at himself and say, "I am not a sinner. I have no need of the Savior or salvation." But once he realizes that he is a sinner, what will he do? Suppose I am in a hospital, sick and about to die. Am I the one who is desperate, or is the hospital administrator the desperate one? Unless I am crazy with a high fever, surely I will be desperate. The hospital administrator cannot worry about me. He cannot worry about all the patients in Canton. If he did, the hospital would have to render treatment to him as well. However, many sinners are not concerned about their sickness. Before the birth of the Lord Jesus, no one was prepared for the coming of the Savior. When Christ was born, no one had invited Him or made any preparations for Him. God Himself made the preparations for Him. Man was not concerned about his own sins, but God was. He wanted to save us; therefore, He prepared a Savior for us. Since man is a sinner, is it not fitting that he should die and perish? Why did God need to be concerned? Why did God need to think of a way to save us? This leads to another question: What has motivated God's salvation?</p><h2 class="head1">THE MOTIVATION FOR GOD'S SALVATION&mdash;HIS LOVE</h2><p>Man fell through sin and deserves death and perdition. But he has no intention to seek salvation. Salvation belongs to Jehovah. It is God who wants to save us; man has no intention of saving himself. According to God's Word, the motivation for God's salvation is His love. Those who become sinners do not love themselves. Yet God loves man. Even though man himself is not concerned or anxious, God is concerned. Man has no intention of saving himself, but God can find a way to save man. The greatest and most precious fact in the Bible is that God's thought towards man is love. In the Bible God's love has three aspects: (1) God is love (1 John 4:16); His very nature is love; (2) God loves the world (John 3:16); God's feeling toward man is love; and (3) God's love is manifested through the cross (Rom. 5:8); this is the work of God's love.</p><h2 class="head2">God Being Love</h2><p>The first aspect of God's love is that God is love. What is the meaning of these words? Christians are very familiar with 1 John 4:16, which says that God is love. This means that love is God's nature. Hence, God is love. For example, I have a little brother who loves to ask questions. He likes to ask questions about wild flowers, chalk, puppies, kittens, etc. Every time I see him, I am apprehensive. I may answer two or three or even ten of his questions, but I cannot answer his countless other questions. When I see him, I address him as Mr. Question and give him some money to go away. Asking questions is part of his nature. This is why I call him Mr. Question. In other words, he embodies the essence of a question. Likewise, love is God's nature. Therefore, God is love. Thank God that He is love. Love is His nature. We must realize that the greatest revelation in the Bible is that God is love.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
