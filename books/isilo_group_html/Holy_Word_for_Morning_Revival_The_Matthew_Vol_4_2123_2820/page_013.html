In this portion of the Word, everything spoken by the Lord is related to two matters: watchfulness and readiness, and faithfulness and prudence....Watchfulness is for the early rapture, and faithfulness is for reward.</p><p>Many Christians have misunderstood...verse [37]. The Lord&#8217;s coming (parousia) will be like the days of Noah. This indicates that...the situation before the Lord&#8217;s coming will be like that in the days of Noah.</p><p>For [at the beginning of verse 38] indicates that this verse is the explanation of why and how the Lord&#8217;s parousia will be like the days of Noah. In the days of Noah the following conditions existed: (1) people were befuddled by eating, drinking, marrying, and giving in marriage, and (2) they did not know that judgment was coming, until the flood came and took them away. When the Lord&#8217;s parousia is about to come, people will likewise be befuddled by the necessities of this life and will not know that God&#8217;s judgment (signified by the flood) will come upon them by the Lord&#8217;s appearing. The believers, however, should be de-drugged and should soberly know that Christ is coming to execute God&#8217;s judgment upon this corrupted world.</p><p>In the beginning, eating, drinking, and marriage were ordained by God for man&#8217;s existence. But because of man&#8217;s lust Satan utilizes these necessities of human life to occupy man and keep him from God&#8217;s interest. At the end of this age, near the coming of the Lord&#8217;s parousia, this kind of situation will be intensified.</p><p>At that time [in verse 40] indicates that while the worldly people are befuddled by the material things and have no sense of the coming judgment, some of the sober and watchful believers will be taken. To the befuddled and senseless people, this should be a sign of Christ&#8217;s coming.</p><p>The two men in verse 40 must be brothers in Christ, and the two women in verse 41 must be sisters in the Lord.... Both watch therefore and your Lord [v. 42] prove that the two men and two women in vv. 40 and 41 are saved believers. The Lord would not charge unsaved people to watch, nor is He the Lord of the unsaved.</p><p>To be taken [vv. 40-41] means to be raptured before the great tribulation. This rapture is a sign of the Lord&#8217;s coming (parousia) and a sign to the Jews.</p><p>[In verse 43] householder refers to the believer, and house to the conduct and work that a believer has built up in his Christian life. A thief comes at an unknown time to steal precious things. The Lord will come secretly, as a thief, to those who love Him and will take them away as His treasures. Hence, we should watch (v. 42). (Life-study of Matthew, pp. 733, 735-741)</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Footnotes</h2><p>40<sup>1</sup> Both in the field and grinding signify working for a living. Although the believers should not be befuddled by the necessities of this life, they need to work for a living. Any thought of giving up proper work by which one earns a living is another extreme of Satan&#8217;s tactics.</p><p>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp. 733-741; Hymns: #956</p><p>Enlightenment and inspiration:</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Holy Word for Morning Revival, The: Matthew, Vol. 4 (21:23-28:20) &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
