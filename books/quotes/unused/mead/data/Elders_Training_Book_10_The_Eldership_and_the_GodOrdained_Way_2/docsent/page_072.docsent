   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. To Keep the Truth at Any Cost</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2 John 1-2 and in 3 John 3-4, the aged Apostle John was happy to know that his children kept the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>C. To Exercise to Quarantine</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do feel that all the churches must do something to help the saints to know the real situation in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The saints must be helped to realize that a "contagious disease" is now among us, and, as in the field of medicine, we must quarantine the diseased ones.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To quarantine does not mean that we do not love those who are "ill," nor does it mean that we cut them off.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It means that we do something to preserve both the contagious ones and the rest of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Divisive Ones</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10, we need to exercise to quarantine the divisive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Romans 16:17 charges us to turn away from those who make divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To turn away from them is to exercise to quarantine them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Titus 3:10 says that we should refuse a factious sectarian, divisive person after a first and second admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To refuse such a one also is to exercise to quarantine him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Heretical Ones</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also need to quarantine the heretical ones, those who go beyond the teaching concerning Christ 2 John 7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to 2 John 10, we should not receive such persons into our home, and even we should not greet them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This also is to quarantine them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Fornicators</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In addition, according to 1 Corinthians 5:2, 11-13, we need to quarantine the fornicators, who live in such a gross sin, by removing them from the fellowship of the church.</S>
