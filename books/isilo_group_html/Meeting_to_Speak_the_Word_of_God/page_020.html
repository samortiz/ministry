BUT CARING FOR THE FEELING OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>After we have touched the spirit of the meeting and have realized what the flow of the meeting is, the first thing we should take care of is not to act independently. Therefore, we must not speak loosely. To speak loosely is to be out of the flow. This disrupts the flow of the meeting. Then what should we do? We must follow the flow. Whether in singing, praying, testifying, or speaking, we must follow the spirit of the meeting, going along with the flow of the meeting. For example, suppose when you enter the hall the flow is that of praising, yet right after you sit down you ask everyone to read the Bible. You have disrupted the spirit of praising. When everyone is praising, you should also jump into the flow of praising and join with the others in the flow of praising. Even the words of your praises should be in the flow, taking the same direction as the praises of everyone else. We all should learn to do this.</p>
<p>Perhaps some may say, &ldquo;It is altogether not a simple thing to attend a meeting. First, we must lay down everything to be called to meet in the Lord&rsquo;s name. Then, in the meeting we must touch the flow of the meeting. If the flow is that of mourning, we must also mourn; if it is that of rejoicing, we must also rejoice; if it is that of praising, we must also praise in the flow. These are things for the &lsquo;professionals.&rsquo; It is too difficult for me.&rdquo; In response, I would say this: Please tell me, is it difficult for you who are in this meeting to speak Chinese? We are all accustomed to speaking Chinese; we have never felt that it is difficult to speak Chinese. However, in the past twenty years, all that I have spoken abroad is in English. What I have written has also been in English. Because of this, I have forgotten how to speak many Chinese expressions and how to write many of the Chinese characters. My point is to show you that whether it is difficult to speak depends on whether you will practice. If you keep on speaking and you speak unceasingly, speaking will not be difficult for you.</p>
<p>I hope you will practice this earnestly, because speaking is our life pulse. This is where the prosperity of the church lies. If our meetings are good, when people come they will be saved. We will also be able to supply them, educate them, and build them up. Thus, the church will become more prosperous day by day. However, if our meetings are poor, we will not have much growth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADMONISHING AND CORRECTING<br />
WITH A TENDER SPIRIT AND THE HUMBLE<br />
AND AMIABLE TONGUE OF A LEARNER</h2>
<p>Second, we should not speak too long so as to encroach upon other people&rsquo;s portion, nor should we replace others by doing everything ourselves. Not only in the big meetings, but even in a home gathering of four or five, each has his portion. You should not take up all the time, thus usurping and replacing others.</p>
<p>Third, you need to learn to exercise your spirit and speak from the depths of your being with a strong voice so that others may hear. An old Chinese saying is that you should speak by sending out the words from your abdomen. The one speaking should raise his voice a little, open his throat a little more, increase his volume, and care for others&rsquo; hearing. Do not make others feel uncomfortable because they cannot hear you.</p>
<p>Fourth, if someone&rsquo;s speaking is too soft, repetitious, or time consuming, admonish and correct him with a tender spirit and the humble and amiable tongue of a learner. This fourth point touches a common sickness among us. The rest of the brothers and sisters are not able to do anything about it; therefore, everyone just tolerates the situation. Actually, it is best not to tolerate this situation. It is better to stop it. However, those who are going to stop others must have a tender spirit. Even having a tender spirit is not adequate; they must also have the humble and amiable tongue of a learner, saying, &ldquo;Brother, would you please leave a little time for others?&rdquo; Sometimes when such an admonition is not received by someone, everyone should bear some responsibility. Do not think that only the leading brother is a policeman. Everyone else should not merely hope that he will come forward to keep things under control. This concept is incorrect. In the meeting all are policemen; everyone is a policeman. By everyone bearing responsibility, I hope that the church in Taipei can thoroughly eliminate all the old problems in the meetings. Then the condition of our meetings can take a new turn.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE NEEDS<br />
OF THOSE ATTENDING THE MEETING<br />
BY BEING FLEXIBLE TO MAKE CHANGES<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SITUATION</h2>
<p>First, we must care for the need of those attending the meeting and minister the word according to their need. If unbelievers are present, we should be flexible to make changes and minister the word of the gospel according to the situation. Even as we are following the flow of the meeting, we may sense that the attendants have diverse needs. We may notice that some brothers are heavily burdened with cares and that others are not yet clear concerning salvation. At that moment we should care for their need and minister the word according to that need. In order to do this we must spend time in the Lord&rsquo;s Word regularly. We also need to practice speaking regularly. Then we will be like an excellent physician who is able to make an accurate diagnosis, and then write the correct prescription with an adequate dose. Such a physician is ready to make a diagnosis and to write a prescription at any time. We all must learn to discern the need of a meeting. Especially those who are the responsible ones should take the lead to do this. They will then be an example to the whole flock. When unbelievers are present, be flexible to make changes and minister the word of the gospel according to the situation. Even if there is only one unbeliever there, you still need to care for him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING OUR BEST TO MAKE UP<br />
THE LACK OF THE SUPPLY OF REALITY<br />
AND TO STRENGTHEN THE SUPPLY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>Sixth, there should be the supply of reality in every meeting. Whenever the supply of reality is lacking, there should always be someone doing his best to make up this lack, to strengthen the supply of the word, and to give a concluding word. Although we do not want anyone to assume a responsible role in the home gatherings, in actuality there is the need for a strengthening word. One whole hour may go by in a meeting of one and a half hours&rsquo; duration, and yet the meeting may still be empty and without reality. At this time some brothers should do their best to make up this lack. If this is done, those attending the meeting will not feel empty when they go home. If a person feels that he is still empty and has gained nothing after a meeting of one and a half hours, he may not want to come back the next time.</p>
<p>Every meeting should give people the sense that they have gained something; only this can keep them. I believe that by the Lord&rsquo;s grace there are at least one or two stronger brothers or sisters in every home gathering. Therefore, they need to be prepared to make up the lack in every meeting and to strengthen the supply of the word. This requires practice. You should not give others the impression that you are the one who always makes up the lack and strengthens the supply of the word. If everyone would practice so that the meeting would have the supply of reality, and if everyone would strengthen the supply of the word and make up the lack, the result would be that everyone in the meeting would experience the enjoyment. Such a meeting would not end in an unpleasant way; instead, everyone would be satisfied. I hope that every one of you would receive these points and fellowship and practice them with one another.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Meeting to Speak the Word of God &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
