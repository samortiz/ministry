   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN THE CONDITION OF OUR HEART Scripture Reading: Psa 19:14; Acts 13:22-23 ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Both of the above passages are related to David.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 19:14 is a prayer of David, while Acts 13:22-23 is a description of David.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In David's prayer, there are the "words of my mouth" and the "meditation of my heart," or the thoughts of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He prayed that he would not only be kept in his words outwardly, but also be acceptable to God in his thoughts inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words of the mouth are an expression of the thoughts of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The heart is the root problem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether or not one outwardly says the right words is not the basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether or not one has an outward attitude in his speaking that is right is also not the basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The thoughts of the heart are the basic problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The thoughts of the heart constitute the root problem and cannot be overlooked.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>David did not merely pray, "God, may the words of my mouth be acceptable before You."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He added to the prayer, "May the meditation of my heart be acceptable before You."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>David's prayer was for the thoughts of his heart to be acceptable before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is why Paul could later testify that David was a man according to the Lord's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A person who is according to God's heart allows God to touch his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you will not allow God to touch your heart, it will be hard for you to be one who is according to His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians ask, "Why is it wrong for me to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Why is it wrong for me to say this?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why is it wrong for me to express myself this way?"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, whether or not you are doing the right thing, saying the right thing, or expressing yourself the right way is not the real problem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, is your heart right when you are doing such a thing, saying such a word, or expressing yourself in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the condition of your heart?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the condition of the root?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even if you are right in every outward thing, it is still possible for your heart to be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is touching the condition of your heart and asking about it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He allows many winds and waves to beat upon His children for this very reason.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He uses these things to touch your heart and to expose the condition of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Bible shows us that David's life was characterized by the way of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He lived a life of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Two names are mentioned at the beginning of the New Testament: Abraham and David.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These two persons ushered in the Lord Jesus; they brought God from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God needs to find someone like Abraham and someone like David before He can have a way to come from heaven to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We know that Abraham is the father of faith; his life was characterized by the way of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only a way of faith can bring God down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>David's life was characterized by the way of the cross; he lived a life of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He not only brought God to men, he also brought His rule among men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you live in faith, you will afford God a way to come to man, and if you live under the cross, you will afford God a way to rule among men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If God's children are willing to take the way of the cross and live a life of the cross, God will rule among men in many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brothers and sisters, in order for God to rule within, you must live the life of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The characteristic of David's life is that he lived the life of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>David suffered many extraordinary experiences throughout his life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These experiences were there to test the condition of his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He was despised at home.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God told Samuel to anoint a son of Jesse to be king, Jesse gathered together his seven sons but forgot David 1 Sam 16:6-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet the heart of the young man was proper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His heart did not become improper through this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God told Samuel, "For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart" v. 7 . God was pleased with David's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is why he was chosen by God and used by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After David killed Goliath, God put him in a situation where the women of Israel proclaimed, "Saul hath slain his thousands,/and David his ten thousands" 1 Sam 18:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>One of these two sentences was a test to David, and the other was a test to Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Proverbs 27:21 says, "As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; / so is a man to his praise."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Will you be proud when others praise you a little?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Will you be jealous when others praise you less?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The praises by the women of Israel tested David's heart as well as Saul's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>David was not moved by the words, "David has slain his ten thousands," but Saul was provoked by the words, "Saul has slain his thousands."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This word exposed Saul's jealousy 1 Sam 18:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Suppose you are engaged in some work with another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If another man comes along and praises your brother for his work, yet says nothing about you, how will you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps you will feel somewhat unhappy and displeased.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This slight unhappiness and displeasure proves that you are not that clean inside.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Did you not say with your mouth that you were doing this for God and not for yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Yet a word of praise from others provokes you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This proves that your heart is not all that clean.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Every experience in our environment, particularly the way we are treated by those close to us, is a test to our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When David killed Goliath, all the hearts of Israel turned to him, yet Saul gave him a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>During that long period of time, he submitted himself under God's hand and dared not walk away from God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This shows how clean David was; his heart was right.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Later after David became king, he suffered a severe trial as the result of a great failure.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His own son sought his life; Shimei cursed him and cast stones at him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>What did he say?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His heart was crystal clear that the Lord had bidden Shimei to come, and he looked to God for his good 2 Sam 16:5-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Do not think that negative circumstances will harm us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If our heart is not right, they will harm us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If our heart is right, they will do us good.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Our circumstances expose our heart's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>David lived a life under the cross, and this life revealed his heart's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Brothers and sisters, we have to be careful about our words and our attitude, but we have to be more careful about the thoughts of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Sometimes what we do outwardly does not necessarily reflect the condition of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Only our inner feelings reflect the true condition of our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is useless to merely guard our mouth because if the heart is not right, it will find the opportunity to express itself sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Brothers and sisters, our idle talk about others exposes our heart's condition.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The more our heart is for God, and the more it seeks after Him in a pure way, the less we will have idle talk.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Every time we gossip and murmur against others, it is a sign that our heart is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A heart that is single towards God will not have too many idle comments concerning others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A brother once said, "If a little brother' offends me, I can forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But if a big brother' offends me, I cannot forgive him."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Another brother who was listening to him nodded his head unceasingly and fixed his eyes on his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The second brother was indicating, "Your heart!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Your heart!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If a little brother' offends you, you can forgive him, but if a big brother' offends you, you cannot forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This exposes your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>To forgive a little brother' when he has offended you does not expose your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But when a big brother' offends you and you cannot forgive, this exposes your heart."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The presence of an offending big brother' exposes the unforgiving heart.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>An object may not burn when it is lit with a match, but when it is thrown into the furnace, it will burn.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This means that the object is not really incombustible.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>A little brother' was not big enough to expose the heart of the brother, but a slight touch from the big brother' exposes his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Brothers and sisters, do not complain about your wife or your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Do not complain about your parents or your children.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>They may be a matchstick, or they may be a furnace, but they are there to expose your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>You should thank the Lord for them.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Dear brothers and sisters, if our heart is right, no one can shake us, and our heart will always be looking to God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>David was according to the Lord's heart because his heart was after God no matter where the Lord put him.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He did not have anything to do directly with men; he was related directly to God.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He received everything from God's hand, and he viewed everything from God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Again I repeat that God uses our circumstances to test our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Brothers and sisters, may we pray the same prayer as the psalmist: "May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart/Be acceptable before You,/O Jehovah, my rock and my Redeemer."</S>
