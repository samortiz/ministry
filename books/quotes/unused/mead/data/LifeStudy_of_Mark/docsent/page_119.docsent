   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WATCHING, PRAYING, AND AWAITING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 13:28-37 we have a word concerning watching, praying, and awaiting the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 28 says, Now from the fig tree learn the parable: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This fig tree signifies the nation of Israel, which the Lord cursed in 11:14.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It passed through a long winter, from the first century to 1948, when the nation of Israel was restored.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That was its branch becoming tender and the putting forth of its leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This fig tree is a sign to the believers of the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To become tender signifies that life has come back, and to put forth leaves signifies outward activities.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Winter signifies the time of being dried up, the time of tribulation; summer signifies the age of the restored kingdom Luke 21:30-31 , which will begin at the Lord s second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verses 29 and 30 the Lord goes on to say, So also you, when you see these things happening, you know that He is near, at the doors.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Truly I tell you, that this generation shall by no means pass away until all these things happen.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The generation here is not that according to age or people, as the generations in Matthew 1:17.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, it is the generation according to the moral condition of the people, as the generation in Matthew 11:16; 12:39, 41, 42, 45; and Proverbs 30:11-14.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verses 31 and 32 the Lord says, The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but My words shall not pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But concerning that day or hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor even the Son, but the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Son, standing in the position of the Son of Man v. 26 , does not know the day or hour of His coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 13:33-37 the Lord speaks strongly concerning watching.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 33 He says, Beware, be watchful; for you do not know when the time is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 35 He tells the disciples, Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house comes, whether in the evening, or at midnight, or at cock-crowing, or in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Finally, in verse 37, the last verse of the chapter, He says, And what I say to you, I say to all, Watch!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be sure, the Lord s word about watching is more than a prophecy; it is also a charge to all the believers of the Slave-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, we need to know the prophecies concerning the things to come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, we need to watch.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE REVIVING OF THE FIG TREE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND THE DELIVERY OF THE NEW MAN</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many aspects of the Lord s prophecy in Mark 13 have been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In particular, we have seen the re-formation of the nation of Israel and the return of Jerusalem to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This may be considered the reviving of the fig tree that was cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although its branch has already become tender and it has begun to put forth its leaves, we do not yet see any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Rather, we may say that the leaves are merely an outward display.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The nation of Israel today has an outward display, but it does not yet have fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you study a map, you will see that the nation of Israel is the center of the inhabited earth geographically, politically, and even militarily.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The situation in the Middle East is a serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The surrounding Arab nations do not seem to have a way to deal with the small nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The re-formation of Israel is a fulfillment of a number of crucial prophecies in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Israel has been re-formed, Jerusalem has been returned, and the fig tree is now showing its leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This should cause us to realize that summer is near.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we cannot say how long it will be until summer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>While the nation of Israel is flourishing, the birth, the delivery, of the new man continues to take place.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The flourishing of Israel and the delivery of the new man are taking place in a parallel way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that the recovery of the church life should go on in parallel with the flourishing of the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This twofold development will reach its climax almost at the same time, the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After studying the first thirteen chapters of the Gospel of Mark, we see that it is not a simple matter to be prepared to enter into the Lord s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First we need to pass through the steps of the long process recorded in chapters one through ten.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we need to follow the Slave-Savior to Jerusalem, where He prepared the environment, the opposers, and His disciples for His redemptive work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also need to hear His word regarding the things to come concerning the Jews, the church, the world situation, the great tribulation, and the Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to study the biblical prophecies not merely to have a knowledge of the prophecies, but especially to have a view of what the Lord is doing today and to understand the purpose of the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From our study of the Scriptures we know what the Lord is doing, and we know the purpose of the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is for the completion of the nation of Israel and also for the completion of the birth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we are not part of the nation of Israel, as believers in Christ we certainly are part of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to have the new man, we need to experience Christ s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Through His death and resurrection we may have the full enjoyment of the wonderful Person of Christ as our replacement.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the clear view of God s economy presented in chapters one through thirteen of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
