   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BRINGING THE LORD'S PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN HIS DEATH, RESURRECTION, AND ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The central point of Watchman Nee's ministry was Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He himself bore this testimony both in his life and in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A good number of those who came in touch with him were brought into identification with Christ in His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They were helped by his ministry to live by Christ in conformity to His death through His resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the central point of his ministry, and this was much deeper than all the previous items of his accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Such a life in union with Christ is the inner substance of the Lord's recovery, the hidden base of the church life, and the sustaining pillar of the Lord's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is this feature which produces the overcomers, who are joined to the Head to fight the spiritual warfare for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose that His kingdom might be brought in.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ESTABLISHING THE LOCAL CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The achievement of his ministry consummated in the establishment of hundreds of local churches, mostly in the Far East.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the time he was arrested in 1952, approximately four hundred local churches had been raised up in China.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Approximately one hundred of these were in the county of Ping-Yang in the province of Chekiang in southern China; over forty were in the province of Suiyuan in northwest China; approximately twenty were to the north in the province of Kiangsu; and over twenty were in the province of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The rest were scattered in major cities and seaports throughout the provinces of China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the situation had not changed, it is possible that these local churches under Watchman Nee's ministry could easily have evangelized the entire country of China.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In addition, over thirty local churches in the southeastern Asian countries of the Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia were directly or indirectly raised up through Watchman Nee's ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>BUILDING UP A MINISTRY OF SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although it was not his specific intention, a ministry of supply was spontaneously built up through his ministry, especially his publication ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the last half century in the Far East, many Christian workers, including those who opposed him, used his writings for their preaching and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His Gospel Bookroom eventually became a station of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Most of the seeking Christians in the Chinese-speaking world received spiritual food and life supply from his publications.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, even the opposing denominations were nourished through his written ministry.</S>
