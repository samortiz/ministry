   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is extremely important to believe in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible says, "Every one who believes into Him may have eternal life" John 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It also says, "Believe into Me," "Believe into My name," etc. What do we believe in? Is believing in the Lord Jesus just believing in His works? Romans 10:17 says, "So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ." If we do not have the word of Christ, what can we believe? The Word of God brings what is far away near to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a person has not laid hold of the Word, I would say that he has not believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without God's Word, what is the basis for our believing?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without God's Word, we only have psychological activities.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What is the difference between faith and psychology?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psychology is thinking that something exists when nothing, in actuality, has been said.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Faith is believing because something has been said.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, if no one invites me for dinner tonight, I may still say, "I believe that someone will invite me for dinner."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not faith because no one has invited me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if someone said that he would like to invite me for dinner tonight and I believe his word, then this is faith, because someone has said it already.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Brothers and sisters, we must have the Word of God before we can believe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Without God's Word, we cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have never actually seen God putting us on the cross; this is something that God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can believe only if God tells us that we have been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How do we know that God's Word is true?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We know because what God has done is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What God says is what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I went to the park yesterday and later said that I had gone to the park, my words would be true because I was at the park.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ has accomplished His work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Word of God tells us what Christ has done.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As long as we believe, all these works become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not have to do anything; we only need to believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without the Word of God, there is no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Faith is to believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Believing in God's Word is harder than anything else; yet at the same time, it is easier than anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This seems contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet it is true.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So many times we cannot believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But once we do, we have everything instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our experience confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Mr. Chapman came to Shanghai to preach the gospel, his work was very prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Before he was saved, he was a doctor of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once after a meeting, Mr. Moody talked to him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Mr. Moody asked him, "Dr. Chapman, are you a saved Christian; are you of Christ?" He answered, "I dare not say so, but I hope that I am of Christ." Mr. Moody read John 3:16 with him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then Mr. Moody asked him again, "Dr. Chapman, are you a saved Christian; are you of Christ?" He again replied, "I dare not say so, but I hope to be one." Mr. Moody then read John 3:16 once again.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he finished reading, he looked at Dr. Chapman, who was embarrassed by Mr Moody's stare.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said, "I really wish I could say that I am of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mr. Moody responded in a severe tone, "Dr. Chapman, whose word are you doubting here?" Right then Dr. Chapman realized that he was doubting the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the rest of his life, he testified that whatever God's Word says is true.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Dr. Chapman thought that he needed to behave before he could go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But God's Word says that those who believe have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Christ, God has accomplished this for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we believe the Word, we have the accomplishments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Believing in God's Word is nothing other than believing whatever God has said.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A president of a Bible school in the United States once said that he could overcome many things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, there were four or five sins that he committed again and again, and he repented again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He told others that his history was a history of repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day he read Romans 6:14, which says, "For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said to God, "Your Word says that sin will not lord it over me, but my condition shows that sin always has dominion over me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, today I believe in your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I declare that I have overcome my sin."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later, when the same temptation came, he realized that he was about to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But he looked to the Word of God, and said to God, "Your Word is true."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In this way he overcame those sins for the rest of his life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers and sisters, it is very important to lay hold of the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When you look at yourself, you are just as corrupted as you were before, and when you look at the circumstances, they are still as difficult as before.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if you believe in God's Word, you will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There was a woman whose health was very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Her sixteen-year-old son was very naughty and would not behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day she prayed to God and told Him that she could not bear such a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>She asked God for a promise, and the Lord gave her the words in Philippians 4:6-7.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She believed that what God had said would be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, her son became worse year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One day a policeman notified her that her son was at the police station because he had been injured by a car.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She went there and found her son with blood all over him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Her husband even fainted when he arrived.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some relatives came too.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But in the midst of the situation, she was still able to smile.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When others asked why her heart was so insensitive, she replied, "God's Word promised me the peace that passes all understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today I encountered something that passes my understanding, and I received the peace that passes all understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is why I can behave this way."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Faith is to lay hold of a certain word of God.</S>
