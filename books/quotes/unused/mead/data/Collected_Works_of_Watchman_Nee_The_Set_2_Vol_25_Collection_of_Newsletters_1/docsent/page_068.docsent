   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Environment of the Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There was a sudden rain on the night of May 6.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the seventh the weather cleared, and it did not rain until the evening of the seventeenth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank the Lord for listening to man's prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At the beginning the enemy attacked fiercely, but he failed from beginning to end and did not gain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these ten days of meetings, the atmosphere was very light and full of the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The listeners were quiet and solemn.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was the Lord binding the enemy, so he did not have the opportunity to manifest his actions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Service of the Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>During this conference all the brothers lived in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sisters lived in another place; they lived in a sister's house.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the aspects of the service down to the lighting of the fire were done by the brothers together; a few things required great strength, so we hired outsiders for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We really saw the Lord with us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The believers "were all together in the same place"; it was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Love one another!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Each according to his ministry!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the function of each one member!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Serving the Lord and serving the brothers is such a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Testimonies of the Co-workers</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Aside from the message meetings, there were a few fellowship meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They solved quite a few difficulties in the church and resolved barriers to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They enabled co-workers to all speak the same thing and to testify to the truth in this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Last Evening of the Conference</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The local brothers served the brothers and sisters from other localities with snacks.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Through this they got to know one another and were able to fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"They partook of their food with exultation and simplicity of heart."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The room was full of joy as if the disciples had "seen the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the Conference Was Over</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The conference was over on the seventeenth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every brother and sister returned to his or her own locality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only a few co-workers remained to discuss a few matters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers Ting Yi Yuan, Feng Hsien Chih, Chi Yung Tung, Chiu Jih Chien, Chen Yung K'uan, Wu Min Hui, and Wu Wei fellowshipped about the work and about past endeavors and future needs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We give glory to the Almighty for what happened, and we ask God for three great necessities in the future: 1 The meeting in Yi Lin lacks the funds for the purchase of the hall, even though the hall is appropriate; 2 there are many brothers who have lost their jobs, and we need to know how to meet their needs; and 3 we need schools where the children of the believers can study.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We placed these three matters in the Lord's hands and looked to His arrangement and will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"We praise Him for what is past; we rely on Him for what is to come."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We still ask the dear brothers and sisters to pray for these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I give you this simple report today to lift up the Lord's victory and to establish our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May glory be to God, and may blessings of peace be to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Your brother in the Lord from Yi Lin, northern Kiangsu,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Wu Wei</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>June 5, 1934</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>NEWS FROM CH'ANGSHA, HUNAN PROVINCE</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My very dear Brother Hu:</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have now received your letter written May 26.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>My heart thanked the Lord very much after receiving it because He has His lovers in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I really hope the Lord will raise up those who will be willing to pay the price to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Brother, we should only care for the pursuit of His kingdom and His righteousness, and the Lord will take care of the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank God, this is our special blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I really thank the Lord for the work here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He always hears our prayers and always works to save men and build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are newly saved ones and there are seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But there are quite a few difficulties because Satan is working to sow division among the brothers and the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is one other thing that I do not know how to deal with today.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A brother saw a vision while praying and claims he saw God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He says that he has gained much wisdom and that Paul's experience in the third heaven was not just given to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He has also raised himself up very much.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He says that even if he reads the Bible casually, he can know everything because he has great wisdom, and that he can grasp and understand what he did not understand before.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Actually, he does not know much.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have exhorted him a few times not to treasure miraculous experiences more than the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The most marvelous thing is that I recently received the last issue of The Overcomer from England, which also mentioned in its last article that ignorant believers can despise others after having miraculous experiences from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>O brother!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>These truly are the end times!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am now pursuing the Lord's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>That precious Word carries power in every sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord's Word is firmer than the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The house built on the solid rock is not the one who can preach, cast out demons, and work miracles, but the one who hears the word of the Lord and does it Matt 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Who are the ones who love the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The one who keeps His word John 14:21, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is the light at the judgment seat?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The word of the Lord John 12:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May the Lord give us grace to realize that when we give an account before the Lord in the future, it will not be based on our experience of the third heaven but on His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May God's every commandment touch my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There have been some students from a Bible school who have come from quite a distance to study the Bible with me recently.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Some of them are quite hungry and thirst much.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May God fill them up.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brother Hu, one as weak as myself, especially needs the prayers of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Please greet the brothers and sisters for me.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Yu Cheng Hua</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>June 1, 1934</S>
