   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER THIRTEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapters 1 4:The preparation for the Lord to come as King and the temptation of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapters 5 7:The moral nature of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Chapters 8 12:The Lord's hinting that He was for the Gentiles on the one hand and for the Israelites on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Chapter 13 is on the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible is not primarily for the purpose of morality but for the purpose of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the entire New Testament, only one verse tells us of the function of the holy Scriptures, and that is 2 Timothy 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse first mentions "teaching," which should be translated "doctrine"; then it stresses the aspect of morality: for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Matthew 13 is truly rich and cannot be exhausted in our entire lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, it is not for morality but for teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Doctrinally, this chapter occupies the greatest position; its subject is the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word "mystery" is used a number of times in the New Testament some have said there are seven mysteries, but this cannot be determined accurately .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the mysteries are equal, except one, which is seen from another standpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The mysteries in the Bible cannot be understood by man's natural mentality; they are revealed and made known to men by the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, they are called mysteries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Among God's manifold mysteries there are the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Other mysteries are found in Ephesians 1:9-10; 3:4-6; 5:32; Colossians 1:27; 1 Corinthians 15:51; 2:7; Revelation 17:5; Romans 16:25; and 1 Timothy 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the chief mysteries in the entire New Testament are found in these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The mysteries that remain must take place according to their predetermined time, between the Lord's first coming and His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They cannot occur before or after this period.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this we see that the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens take place in this age and have nothing to do with the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From verse 35 of this chapter we can see that the mysteries that take place today were not evident in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 1:"On that day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"That day" is the day that the Lord broke His relationship with the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A "house" implies that it belongs to someone; it has a boundary and is a place of calmness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sea does not belong to anyone, is without limit, and is stormy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That the Lord went out of the house proves that God has come out of that which has a boundary and a limitation into that which is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The evil men are like the stormy sea, while the house is a quiet and orderly place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This refers to the conduct of the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord departed from the moral sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that He forsook the Jews and went to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Bible the sea signifies the Gentiles, and the earth signifies the Jews Rev 13:1, 11; Dan 7:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 2:"And great crowds were gathered to Him, so that He stepped into a boat and sat, and all the crowd stood on the shore."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord went out of the house, but He did not go into the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He sat in a boat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The boat, which was in the sea but not of the sea, signifies the church, which is in the world but not of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord left the Jews and went to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, He did not go to all the Gentiles; He went only to the Gentiles who were in the boat and spoke there in the church .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Why did the Lord need to speak in parables?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 11 of this chapter points out clearly that the things of the kingdom are for His disciples to know and not for the outsiders to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The disciples understood by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, to them more was given so that they would abound.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But from those who do not have referring to the Jews , even that which they have i.e., the miracles and wonders which were done by the Lord among them and which they saw will be taken away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From then on the Lord performed no more miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He spoke to them in parables because they could neither see nor hear.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their eyes and their ears had problems because their heart had a problem first.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Their heart had become fat, and they rejected the Lord, so there was no way for them to be saved 2 Thes 2:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By this we know that all the parables in the Bible are spoken to the disciples and not to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The phrase "the kingdom of the heavens has become like," or "the kingdom of the heavens is like," is used six times in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There are seven parables in this chapter, and if the one on the treasure of things new and old is included, there are eight parables.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, the first parable does not say "the kingdom of the heavens has become like" or "the kingdom of the heavens is like."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Three parables were spoken in the house specifically to the disciples; three parables were spoken at the seashore where both the Jews and the disciples were present.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever the Bible mentions the numbers three, seven, ten, and twelve, they signify completion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The number three is the number of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Seven is completeness in time which is temporary .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ten is human completeness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Twelve is eternal completeness; it is a number signifying the relationship between God and men.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although the parables in Matthew 13 apparently do not have positive significance, there is a line of progression going toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In contrast, the condition of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation 2 and 3 is not so; it is a line of degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A very important principle in studying the Bible is that the release of the truths in the Bible has dispensational restrictions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, we need to be humbled under God's mighty hand 1 Pet 5:6 , and when we have a specific need, God will give us the light.</S>
