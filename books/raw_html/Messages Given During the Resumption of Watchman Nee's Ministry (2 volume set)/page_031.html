<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD GAINING MAN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONFERENCE (1)</H1><p>Date:Evening, January 7, 1948<br>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung<br>Speaker:Witness Lee<br>Attendance:200-300 people</p><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PRINCIPLE IN HIS WORK</H2><P>In coming here this time, I do not expect to hold large conferences or to do any great works. My hope is to fellowship with the brothers and sisters, and especially with those who are involved with the Lord's service. We see that both in the Old Testament and the New Testament, God's principle in His work is the same, and that is to gain an individual or a few individuals from every place. When He gains an individual or a few individuals, He has a way to go on. Many people neglect this point. They like to stir up others and to rally others around them. But merely stirring people up and rallying them around oneself will not afford God a way. In every place, God needs to gain some people; without this God cannot do anything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE MEN GOD IS AFTER&#151;<br>THOSE WHO ARE PURE, POOR IN SPIRIT, SIMPLE,<br>TRANSPARENT, AND SINGLE-HEARTED TOWARD GOD</H2><P>During the past twenty years, there were big conference meetings and  big revival meetings everywhere. But God did not have a way because not many people were gained by the Lord. Today, we are not merely hoping to see many people saved and revived; what we hope to see is not that kind of work of the Holy Spirit. We only hope to see a small number of people rising up, those who are pure in heart, who are poor in spirit, and who can drop everything within them to seek after God single-heartedly.</P><P>Today, I hope that you will not be busy taking care of others, or waiting for others to come to this conference. I hope that we would go to the Lord in a quiet way. Please do not misunderstand what I am saying, but things such as your work, your church, the saving of souls, and so forth, have no place in my heart. I only wish to see us turning to the Lord in a pure, direct, and simple way, so that we can touch the Lord in a definite way and can know the way He wants to go on in us. Only one thing is crucial: to be taken hold of by the Lord. When that happens, God will have a way, and He will be able to flow out of us, and others will receive the blessing. Otherwise, we will not be able to render others any real blessing. We hope that we can meet God here, or that God can meet us and occupy us. Within us, we do not have to pray for others, or to pray for this meeting, and we do not have to pray for the Lord to bless this meeting. I do not expect the Lord to "bless" this meeting. I only hope that there will be a group of brothers and sisters who will fellowship with the Lord in a quiet, pure, unperturbed, and unencumbered way. I hope to see a group of brothers and sisters who are as transparent as glass. If there are such ones, we will see great blessings in this place.</P><P>We have to learn to turn to the Lord in a simple way. You do not have to pray for me, and I do not expect to see too many people here. Sometimes, when there are too many people, God does not have a way to go on. For example, Zaccheus was hindered from seeing Jesus because there were too many people. We have to be like Zaccheus, climbing higher than others. If we do this, we will see, and our lives will change. Too often people hinder us from seeing the Lord. Here we need to transcend, to rise above the crowd, and leave others under our feet. In the whole universe, there is only you and God; everything is under God. In this way, blessing will come. In Swatow, if there are two or three brothers who are touched by God in this way, He will have a broad and free way to go on. This is the only way to bring in a revival in Swatow.</P><P>Many people will advise you to fast or to pray without sleeping. But I say today: you do not need to pray that much. Of course, I am not saying that you should be lazy. What I mean is that your heart has to be pure and simple. We should not be unresponsive or passive. But neither should we be over-zealous or aggressive. Those who are not zealous will receive nothing, and those who are over-zealous will also receive nothing. Many times, God has no way to help the zealous ones, and He has no way to help the over-hungry ones.</P><P>During the past ten years or more, there were some very zealous ones in northern China. I have not seen another group of people more zealous than they were. They could fast for a few days, pray continuously for a few hours, or keep themselves awake a few nights without sleeping. When I met these people, I had no way to help them. I only wished that I could pull them back and have them sit down to rest. May the Lord be merciful to us. Here we do not have any excitement, and we do not have the flesh. We only hope to be simple, pure, and restful. In this way, we will touch God.</P><P>Many times, when we say we are turning to God, our turning does not cause us to obtain mercy. I see many people in the church who are like black chimneys; they are full of black smoke. No matter how strong the light is, a man cannot see anything through a cloud of black smoke. Many brothers and sisters cannot allow light to pass through them because of their flesh and their natural life. They are not transparent. A piece of glass is not like that; it is transparent, and light can pass through. Some people are too hungry, too unworldly, too much for the Lord, and too zealous. As a result, they become misguided. I am not saying this in a light way. We should pray before the Lord, and in our prayer we should ask the Lord to make us more simple and more clear. May the Lord be merciful to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PRAYER</H2><P>Prayer: Lord, we ask for mercy before You. We commit this word into Your hand. Cause us to be pure. Cleanse us, that we can meet You within us, and that our inner being can be turned to You in a real way. We need Your precious blood to cleanse us in many ways, so that our heart will not condemn us. May we turn to You from the depths of our being, and may we feel Your presence. May we come before You as coming before the throne. We pray this in the Lord's name, amen.</P>
