   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REQUIREMENTS OF ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHO MINISTERS TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who ministered to God before Him had to be clothed with linen garments, linen bonnets on their heads, and linen breeches on their loins.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Their whole body was clothed with linen material.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 17 also says that no wool should come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No one who ministered to the Lord could be clothed with wool.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before God, no one could ever put on woolen garments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please read Ezekiel 44:18: "They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causeth sweat."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This portion of the Word reveals that all those who minister to the Lord should not sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All work that produces sweat is not pleasing to God and is rejected by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the meaning of sweat?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first sweat in the entire world was shed by Adam when he was driven out of the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Genesis 3 tells us that, due to Adam's sin, God punished him by saying, "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sweat is a result of the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Due to God's curse, the ground ceased to yield its fruit; due to the absence of God's blessing, human effort is necessary, and this causes sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the work that causes sweat?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the work that comes out of human effort without the blessing from God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone ministering to God should absolutely abstain from any work that causes sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Numerous works placed before God require effort and running around for their accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Everyone ministering to God must do a work that causes no sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of God's work is serene; it is not accomplished by running around but by sitting down.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although outwardly one may be very busy, he is very restful within; although outwardly it is hot, within it is very calm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This work is done by sitting down.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the work that causes no sweat!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the real work before God is not accidental and not accomplished by fleshly effort.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unfortunately, so much of today's work cannot be accomplished without sweating.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What a pity that today's work cannot be accomplished unless someone is planning, sponsoring, promoting, proposing, running around, admonishing, exhorting, and exerting human effort and fleshly strength.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Oh, it is really a pity that in most cases, without sweat, there is no work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Please bear in mind that sweating outside is permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In slaying cattle and sheep outside, serving sinners, and ministering to the saints, sweating is permissible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are doing that kind of work, you can sweat all you want.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But those who minister to the Lord in the Holy Place absolutely cannot sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God does not need man's sweating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No doubt, all work is busy, but God's work does not need fleshly strength.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not mean that there is no need of spiritual strength.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In fact, how much spiritual strength you need and how much suffering you have to go through is hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one cares to distinguish between spiritual work and fleshly work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Men conclude that all of God's work cannot be accomplished without running around, spending time to discuss and debate, negotiating, proposing, approving, and authorizing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yet if you ask them to wait quietly before God and listen to His speaking, they cannot do it because the flesh is not capable of doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Oh, all these require sweating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The most important aspect of spiritual work is to deal with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first person we should contact is God, not man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The work of the flesh is different; the first one it contacts is man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, if a work cannot be accomplished without man, it is not the work of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How precious it is to be in God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We have to deal with Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We are not idle; rather, we are doing a work that causes no sweat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we deal properly with God, there is no need to sweat before man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We can accomplish the most amount of work with the least amount of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reason there are so many advertisements, promotions, and proposals is because men are not praying before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let me say that all spiritual work is done only before God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we take care of our work properly before God, we will not need many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Others will spontaneously respond to us and spontaneously profit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is working, and there is no need of human strength and sweating.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brothers and sisters, we should examine ourselves very honestly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us ask Him, "O Lord, am I really ministering to You or to the work?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>O Lord, is my ministry unto the house or unto You?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we are sweating from morning till evening, then we can surely say to ourselves that we are ministering to the house and not to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If all our business and laboring are to meet outward needs, we can conclude that we are ministering to people and not to God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I do not despise such people, for they also are doing God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is a need for some to slay the cattle and sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is a need for some to lead and guide others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The children of Israel needed some to minister to them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But God desires something much deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We ought to pray to Him, "O God!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I beg You to deliver me that I might not fall into the realm of ministering to the people."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is more than just ministering to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brothers and sisters, too many are already ministering to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Why do we still want to add our portion there?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God has no way to demand everyone to minister to Him; God cannot do this since many are not willing to minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Because man is not willing, it is impossible to revive the whole church and cause everyone to become faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many are truly saved and have God's life, yet they just want to minister to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is no way to change them because they do not want to miss the excitement on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They will not let go of the work on the outside; their focus is on the field of work.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Surely, there are some who need to take care of these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But the question is, are we among those taking part in these things?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I hope we all can say to the Lord, "O God, I want to minister to You.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am willing to drop everything, to let go of all the work and forsake all the outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I want to minister to You and do a spiritual work.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I am willing to give up all the outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I want to enter within, more deeply within."</S>
