<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY IN EPHESIANS 6<br />
BEING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Everyone who reads the Bible knows that Ephesians 6 emphasizes the whole armor of God. The church is not only the Body, the new man, and the bride&mdash;the counterpart of Christ; it is also the warrior. The church as the new man is toward Christ, but toward Satan the church is the warrior. In order to fight with Satan, the church must put on the whole armor of God. Putting on this armor involves six items: girding the loins with truth, putting on the breastplate of righteousness, having the feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace, taking up the shield of faith, receiving the helmet of salvation, and receiving the sword of the Spirit (vv. 14-17). The first five items are for protection; the last item, the sword, is for offense. This sword is called the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.</p>
<p>It is easy for those who read the Bible to see these items. However, the key to chapter 6 is the Spirit, not these items. If the word in chapter 5 does not become the Spirit in chapter 6, we will have no way to enjoy Christ. We, the Bible, and Christ are separate without the Spirit. Without the Spirit neither Christ and the Bible are one, nor are we and the Bible one. Christ, the Bible, and we are not joined together without the Spirit; we are separated. It is the Spirit who joins Christ and the Bible as one, and it is the Spirit who joins the Bible and us as one. We may liken the Spirit to the electrical current in a large building, which connects many appliances. The electrical current is the connection, the joining factor, for all the appliances. Likewise, Christ, the Bible, and the church are not connected without the Spirit. When the Spirit comes, the Spirit is not only in Christ and in the Bible but also in the church. The Spirit joins Christ, the Bible, and the church as one. The Spirit makes the riches of Christ the experience of the church and the content of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>On our side, we have a spirit, which responds to the Spirit. These two spirits&mdash;the Spirit and our human spirit&mdash;are crucial. Regrettably, most Christians neglect both the Spirit and the human spirit. How much time do we spend in our spirit? Most of the time we are in our mind, not in our spirit. In addition to our spirit, we also have a mind, emotion, and will and also our flesh, lust, and temper. When we are not in our spirit, we fall into these other things.</p>
<p>As believers, we have the Lord and we love the Lord. We have heard many truths in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and we understand the Bible. However, most of the time we do not enjoy the Lord. Instead, we live in outward activities because we are not in the spirit. What should we do in such a situation? We should receive the sword of the Spirit by pray-reading. We must pray-read in our spirit, because our spirit is the proper organ to receive the Lord&rsquo;s word. We must use the proper organ to receive the Lord&rsquo;s word, just as we must use our mouth to drink water, not our nose or ears.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO ENJOY THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Lord has accomplished everything. He released His life by passing through death and resurrection. Furthermore, all the riches of His life are available in the Word of God. In order for these riches to become our enjoyment, we must realize that receiving the riches in the Word is not a matter of learning letters but of receiving the Spirit, &ldquo;which Spirit is the word of God&rdquo; (v. 17). We need to use our spirit to contact the Spirit through prayer. We have gradually touched this secret over the past decades.</p>
<p>I was saved more than fifty years ago. After I was saved, I began to pray. I was taught to pray in this way: &ldquo;Dear heavenly Father, thank You for loving me. You sent Your Son to die for me on the cross. He shed His precious blood to cleanse my sins. I believe in Him! Heavenly Father, You have forgiven me and given me the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit helps me every day to love people, to be humble, to do things to please You, and to glorify Your name. I do not know how to pray, but I pray in the name of Jesus, Your Son. Amen.&rdquo; This kind of prayer is not wrong, but it is not effective. It is like a person searching for the switch to turn on a light but being unable to find it.</p>
<p>Later I encountered some difficulties, and being excessively burdened, I had no choice but to change my way of praying. I dropped my scripted prayers and simply came before God, telling Him of the sorrows in my heart. After this, I prayed in a very genuine way out from my spirit, no longer praying in an old way.</p>
<p>Gradually, the Lord showed me that the simplest way to pray in our spirit, rather than our mind, is to call on His name. Whether we call loudly or quietly, audibly or inaudibly, everyone who practices calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name knows that this is the easiest way to pray from the spirit rather than the mind. When we use our spirit in such a way, we touch the Spirit. The Bible and the Spirit become one when we touch the Spirit. When we call on the Lord&rsquo;s name as we are pray-reading the Bible, the words of the Bible spontaneously become our prayer. At this point our prayer is our reading of the Bible, and our reading of the Bible is our prayer. Such a prayer is prayer in the spirit, prayer mingled with the Spirit. In as little as a few minutes, we will become bright, living, fresh, buoyant, satisfied, strengthened, and inwardly supplied. It is amazing that within a few minutes light, living water, the word, strength, and love come to us. The messages in this section are very profound, but they conclude with the practical matter of pray-reading.</p>
<p>God has an eternal purpose, which is to work Himself into man. For this purpose Christ came. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, died on the cross, and released the divine life from within Him. All the riches of His life are in the Bible. This Bible is the word of God, and the word is Spirit, the Spirit who gives life. When we contact the word, we need to forget about our mind and our problems. We should not pray dead prayers but simply use our spirit to pray in a living way. Through such prayer, we eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord. When we call on the Lord in spirit and pray-read the words of the Bible in spirit, the word of God will become the Spirit flowing through and supplying us as the living water and giving us strength, light, truth, and life so that we may have a rich, strong, and flourishing church life. Then God will have a way to carry out His eternal purpose through the church on the earth.</p>
