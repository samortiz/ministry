   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANNULLING ORGANIZATION, HIERARCHY,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE CLERICAL SYSTEM AND RECOVERING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY OF MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Furthermore, the way to set up the home meetings is to annul organization, hierarchy, and the clerical system.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In our meetings there should not be anyone claiming to have a position over others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all are nobodies and are all the same in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one has any rank.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no hierarchy, and no one is special or belongs to a special class.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In setting up the home meetings we must recover the God-ordained way of meeting from house to house Acts 2:46; 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AFFORDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR EACH MEMBER</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>TO FUNCTION IN THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must also afford opportunities for each member to function in the meeting 1 Cor 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must set up the home meetings in such a way that every attendant, even a young child, has an equal opportunity to function.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even a young girl can call a hymn or a young boy can start the singing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>PROMOTING AND DEVELOPING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE ORGANIC GIFTS OF EACH MEMBER</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we must learn how to promote and develop, that is, to cultivate, the organic gifts of each member of the Body of Christ Rom 12:4-5; Eph 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the attendants in the meeting have a gift because they are the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Each one s gift comes out of the divine life which he possesses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have God s life within us, and this life produces something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As an infant begins to grow, his organic function begins to be cultivated within him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually he can speak, walk, and do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This illustrates the development of the organic gift within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As regenerated Christians we must let the divine life develop within us, and this development produces the gift of life, the organic gift.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, the practice of Christianity kills the organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christians are encouraged to sit dumbly in the meetings and are not able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way of Christianity is a killing and binding way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those in this way do not have the adequate opportunity to function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the proper Christian meetings we should afford everyone a sufficient time and opportunity to exercise his gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even a young boy of six years of age can say, Praise the Lord, Lord Jesus, I love You, or God is good for food.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In every home meeting, we must help all the attendants to develop their organic gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This requires that we be a proper pattern, an example, for them to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we ourselves must forsake the old way and annul anything of organization in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>From the time we first set up a meeting, we must always make it clear that everyone has to function and learn to exercise his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is remarkable that little children learn language not by being taught but by living among and listening to other speakers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The ability to learn language is born into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the same way, every man is born with a human spirit and can call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, we must have the confidence that even the little ones in the meetings can function.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In setting up the home meetings we have no intention to organize something to build up a facade to attract people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must simply help the new ones to meet in their homes to worship God and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>MEETING BY THE SPIRIT AND WITH THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>AND IMPRESSING THE NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>WITH THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the home meetings we must also meet by the Spirit 1 Cor 12:1-3 and with the word of God 1 Cor 12:8; 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These are the first two basic factors for the Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, we should impress the new believers not with anything of the deformed and degraded Christianity but with the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must make a definite and thorough decision not to bring anything of the old way into the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Once we bring natural and religious things into the meeting, the new ones will be impressed with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then it will be hard to drop them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Be very careful in setting up meetings in the new ones homes.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Simply go there to help them to have a home meeting, and impress them with the God-ordained way to practice the New Testament economy.</S>
