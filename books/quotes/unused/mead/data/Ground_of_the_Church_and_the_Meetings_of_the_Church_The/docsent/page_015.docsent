   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEAVING OUR TRADITION AND OLD CONCEPTS TO COME TO THE MEETING IN A LIVING WAY WITH THE CHRIST WE HAVE ENJOYED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Concerning the technique for meeting, there are no rules or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regardless of what kind of meeting we have for the Lord's table, for prayer, for study, or for a message we almost always sit and wait for a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is no such teaching that we should always start the meeting with a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From where did we learn this?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is simply a tradition that has crept in. Whether starting with a hymn is right or wrong depends on Christ and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, from whom did we learn that only the responsible brothers should announce a hymn?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who gave us this kind of regulation?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not condemn the responsible brothers for this, because it is we who have been too much of a "tomb."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because we do not take the responsibility, the so-called responsible brothers are forced to act as the "clergy."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may say that we do not have a laity and a clergy, but in actuality we do.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each of us is responsible for this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our old concept must be dropped.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not a matter merely of changing the forms.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is a matter that depends on our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all have to live by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all have to labor on the good land, and we have to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then when we come to the meeting, there is no need to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no need to have either a prayer or a hymn first.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everything will come out spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The right way to meet requires that we have a proper daily walk, have an adequate experience of Christ, and exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then our spirit will be strengthened, living, active, and positive.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then when we come to the meeting, we will spontaneously pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some may say that this spontaneous way will cause confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not believe it will, but I would even prefer this kind of living "confusion" to a deadened order.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we all live in the spirit to experience Christ, whatever we pray when we come to the meeting will be right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Variety will produce beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we could go to the feasts of the people of Israel, we would see the variety of the riches of the surplus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we all pray from our experience of Christ by exercising our spirit, even if there is a variety, there will still be the beauty, and there will be the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we have been influenced by certain kinds of regulations, each one comes just to sit here.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are used to doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not saying that we need a change of form.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, we need a change in life and a change of concept.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then we will be truly diligent, zealous, active, positive, strong, and living in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As Christian brothers and sisters, we have to conduct our Christian life in this way, day by day laboring on Christ and experiencing Him by our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn how to exercise our spirit, be strengthened, be living, and be active and positive in our spirit to experience Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then whenever we come to the meeting, we must realize that it is our duty to share something.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Deuteronomy 16:16 tells us that the people of God could not appear before Jehovah empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They had to come to the feast with something of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Likewise, we need to have something of Christ to bring to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we all will be open to Him, and there will be a way widely opened for the Holy Spirit to move among us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many riches of Christ will come out and be offered to God for His satisfaction and for our enjoyment in the presence of God with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is our way of meeting and our worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In this way there will be no forms, regulations, laity, or clergy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, all the living members will bring something of Christ to offer to God by the exercise of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the proper way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are on the way of recovery, and this way to meet is an item in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have to drop the old way, the way of form and regulation taken from the tradition we formerly practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us look to the Lord and cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I say again, we should not merely change our form, but we must change our realization, our concept, and our way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we will come to the meeting in the living way, with a new way of life under a new realization.</S>
