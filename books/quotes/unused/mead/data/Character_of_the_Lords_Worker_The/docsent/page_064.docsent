   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In regard to subjectivity, a further point should be noted: Our subjectivity must be dealt with by God before we will be fit to deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God will lead us to deal with other men only when we ourselves are first dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He will not commit anything to a subjective man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God cannot trust such a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A subjective person cannot do God's will, and he has no way to lead others to do His will.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a subjective person is put into God's work to instruct others in the way of God, his own will comes out ten times stronger than does the Lord's. A subjective person wants everyone to listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Unless a person is brought to the point where he has lost all interest in gaining a following, he cannot be used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should allow ourselves to be broken and smashed to the degree that we no longer crave obedience from others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not interfere with others' freedom, personal lives, or personal judgments.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have no interest in other people's life or affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As servants of the Lord, we must be dealt with by the Lord to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only then can we be used by Him to speak as His deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, there is a real threat of our usurping God's authority to carry out our own will, through which we would become a ruler, teacher, or father over God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord said, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them...It shall not be so among you" Matt 20:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a man has never been broken by the Lord, if he secretly cherishes his own ideas, demands, and hobbies, God cannot use him because he is untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God entrusts His flock to such a person, he will lead the flock to his own house.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people are not worthy of God's trust; God cannot entrust anyone into their hands.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a man is interested only in his own ways, he cannot lead others into God's way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our brother Paul was very pliable.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He was single, and he knew that it was better to remain single than to be married.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet he never criticized marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, how exercised was our brother before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a man is subjective and if his subjectivity is never broken, he will surely insist on everyone being a virgin and remaining unmarried.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He will surely condemn every marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A subjective man can easily do this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But here was a man who was different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He could stand for what he did; he knew the value of what he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet at the same time, he gave others the freedom to make their own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wished that others would be spared of all sufferings of the flesh, yet he agreed that others should be married.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here was a man who was firm in the Lord, yet at the same time, he was soft and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In discussing the matter of marriage, he was still able to declare that the teaching of abstinence was a teaching of demons, even though he was a single man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to take such a stand.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can never overemphasize a truth just because we feel that way, nor can we shut our mouth to a truth just because we feel differently.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Once we give up trying to influence God's truth according to our feelings, we are qualified to work and to lead others according to the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A basic requirement for us to be in the work is to be broken and to have our subjectivity dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If our subjectivity still dominates us, we will lead God's work astray as soon as it is put into our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is a terrible thing for a person to act rashly and speak carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should learn to stop interfering with other people's business.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should never dictate the lives or affairs of others with our own subjectivity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God does not interfere with man's free will.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil was placed in the garden of Eden.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God told man not to eat of it, but He did not keep man away from it with a fiery sword.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the fiery sword in chapter three had been used in chapter two to guard the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man would never have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It would have been easy for God to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But He did not do this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Instead, He said, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen 2:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If man insisted on eating it, that was his own business.</S>
