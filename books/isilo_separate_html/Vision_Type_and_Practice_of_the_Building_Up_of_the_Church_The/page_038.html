<p>In order to be mingled with God, to become wood overlaid with gold, we must enter into the Holy Place and take Christ as our bread of life, light of life, and acceptance of life, that is, to experience the Christ typified by the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar in the Holy Place (Heb. 9:2). We can live in God&rsquo;s presence by Christ as the bread of life, we can walk in the light of God&rsquo;s presence because Christ is in us as the light of life, and we are accepted into God&rsquo;s presence because Christ is in us as the incense of resurrection. The indwelling Christ as our life enables us to live before God, walk in His light, and be accepted in His presence.</p>
<p>The highest expression in the outer court was the fine linen hangings. In the Holy Place, however, to be a Christian is not only to have outward conduct that matches the fine linen hangings but also to enjoy the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, and the golden incense altar. The experience in the outer court condemns our hate of others and approves our love for them, but the experience in the Holy Place asks what the source of our love is. Does our love come from our natural life or from Christ as life? According to the experiences in the outer court, being proud and despising others are wrong but being humble and highly esteeming others are proper. However, the experiences in the Holy Place ask what life is the source of our humility. Is our humility lived out of our adamic life or out of Christ as life? Although the brothers should highly esteem one another and not despise others, we must ask whether the esteem that we give to one another comes from our natural life or from Christ as our life. If our humility, our highly esteeming others, our goodness, and our perfection come from our natural life, they are, at best, hangings in the outer court; they are not wood overlaid with gold and therefore cannot be built up.</p>
<p>Believers who experience only the hangings in the outer court are likely to become proud. A Christian who only takes care of becoming proper will despise and condemn others. To say that we are humble but that others are bad and proud only proves that we are proud. Proud people can never be joined to others.</p>
<p>If such a believer would touch Christ as life and leave the outer layer of behavior to enter into the layer of life, he would become humble. He would know that his love and humility are imperfect and that no matter how good his love and humility may be, they are not acceptable to God and cannot be brought into the Holy Place. In the Holy Place only Christ as life is acceptable to God. Good conduct may be acceptable in the outer court, but it is condemned in the Holy Place. Only by taking Christ as life can we be acceptable to God in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>We will also discover that as Christians, good conduct cannot satisfy us. The more proper our conduct becomes, the emptier we will feel. The food and satisfaction that we need are the inner life, not outward conduct. Even if our conduct is perfect, we will still be in the natural light. Our good conduct will become a veil to us. The more humble and loving we are, the blinder our inner eyes will be. Good conduct can only block light, but experiencing Christ as life will cause us to see light.</p>
<p>We need to be able to distinguish between a Christian in the outer court and a Christian in the Holy Place. A Christian in the outer court condemns his deeds and is forgiven by God and cleansed. A Christian in the Holy Place knows Christ inwardly as his life, his satisfaction, his light, and his acceptable fragrance before God. We should ask ourselves whether we are Christians in the outer court or Christians in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>Sometimes we are like the priests in the Old Testament, because we enter into the Holy Place, but soon after, we go out to the altar and the laver again. We enter and leave the Holy Place often. Last night we were in the outer court, this morning we were in the Holy Place, but in the evening we go back out to the outer court. It is difficult to find a person who lives in the Holy Place.</p>
<p>We cannot be built up if we only pay attention to improving our conduct. We must touch Christ as life in order to experience the mingling of the divine nature with our human nature. Gold is not as hard as acacia wood. The boards are able to stand because of acacia wood, not by means of the gold. Acacia wood is a very hard wood, and it signifies the resurrected humanity. The believers who are in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection are firm and strong in their humanity. For example, the Lord raised up strong and firm persons, such as Luther, Darby, and M&#252;ller, to testify for Him. However, to stand firm is different from being joined with others. We are not joined with other believers in our humanity, which is typified by acacia wood. We are joined with other believers in the divine nature, typified by gold.</p>
<p>When we enter into the Holy Place and experience Christ as life, we will be mingled with God, and we will spontaneously be softened to understand the weak and to accommodate the defeated so that we can be joined and built up with them.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
