<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. In the Believers</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) Beginning with Regeneration</H2><P>In principle, the experience is the same with the believers today. With the believers, this transfer of life begins with regeneration (John 3:3, 5). After being regenerated, we are in the process of the transfer of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) Accomplished by the Experience<br>of Spiritual Circumcision</H2><P>With the believers, the transfer of life is accomplished by the experience of circumcision, by the putting off of the flesh (Col. 2:11; Gal. 5:24). Today God is circumcising us, and this circumcision lasts quite a long time. I believe that many among us are still under God's circumcising hand. You may still cling to your fleshly strength or to your natural man. This requires God to come in and cut, or circumcise, that part of you. Hence, we all are in the process of being circumcised. In other words, we are in the process of transformation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>3) Completed at the Redemption and<br>Transfiguration of Our Body</H2><P>The transfer of life will be fully completed at the time of the Lord's coming back. At that time our body will be fully redeemed and transfigured (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21). Then we shall be the called ones, not only in the transfer of race, but also in the complete transfer of life. At that time we shall enjoy all of the blessings that God promised to our father Abraham. This is God's calling. God's calling is not for Abraham's natural descendants. God's calling is for the people who follow Abraham to exercise the obtained faith, to live by and in God, and to experience the transfer of life by the working of God. As a result of this process, we shall be altogether another people, a people of God's calling. Then we shall enjoy all the blessings of God's promise. All that God promised to Abraham will be the blessings of the New Testament gospel in which we all shall participate through faith in Christ.</P>
