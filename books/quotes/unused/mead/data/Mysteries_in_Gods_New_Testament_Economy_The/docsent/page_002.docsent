   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FOREWORD TO THE CONFERENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depth of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Under Your sovereignty, You have arranged the circumstances and have prepared all of us to be gathered together from all the scattered places into Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, remember that we are meeting in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We remind You of Your promise that You will be with us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May You fill this conference with Your glorious Self.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sanctify these four days.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, grant us a clear sky, one that is open, unclouded, and unveiled, so that we would be full of eyes within and without and would be as clear as the four living creatures are before You.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we worship You for giving us such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>May You bring us into all that we pray and ask for and grant us all the glorious facts that we beseech You for, so that we would know Christ, the Body of Christ, the economy of God, and God's move on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>O Lord Jesus, fill our minds and our mouth with Yourself so that we would not talk about anything else, but would only talk about Christ and His glorious Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>May this one thing fill our hearts, and may it fill the prayers and praises that we offer to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, thank You that You are with us daily until the end of the age, according to Your promise at the end of Matthew 28.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Lord, bless this day.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this day may all that we feel, all that we think about, all that we touch, all that we talk about, speak of, and sing of, and all that is expressed within and without be just You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lord, we are sitting with You in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Preserve us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not let us lower ourselves, and do not allow us to descend.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>May Your own Self fill our vision, our speaking, and all of our conversations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O Lord Jesus, while we are praising You, we cannot forget about Your enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We pray that You would bind him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also bind him in Your victorious name.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Lord, we believe what we are binding is what You have bound in heaven already.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lord, release Your riches, and release our spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We believe that whatsoever we release has been released in the heavens already.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>May You gain the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After being separated for such a long time, it is a joy to be gathered together under one roof again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The reason that we are all gathered together this time is that a few of the responsible brothers from Taipei took the opportunity to make a visit to Southeast Asia in March.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Based on what they have seen and experienced, they felt that there was the need for all the elders and co-workers of all the churches in Asia to come together for fellowship and to seek the Lord together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For that reason we decided to have this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Perhaps the feeling of the brothers is inclined toward the meeting of the present need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But my feeling before the Lord is not to take care of the present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, it is to be turned away from the present situation and to enter into a new day and another age.</S>
