   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Of the Tribe of Benjamin</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul could also be confident in the fact that he was of the tribe of Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was a lovely and faithful tribe, among whom was the royal city of Jerusalem with the temple of God Deut 33:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>E. A Hebrew of the Hebrews</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul also says that he was a Hebrew of the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was a Hebrew born of Hebrew parents with Hebrew ancestry on both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, his grandparents on both sides were Hebrews as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only such a one could say that he was a Hebrew of the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A full-blooded Hebrew, he could boast that he was of pure Hebrew blood.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>F. A Pharisee Keeping the Law</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 5 Paul tells us that, as to the law, he was a Pharisee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The law here is the law of Moses respected by all orthodox Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a Pharisee, Paul was a member of the strictest sect of the Jewish religion Acts 26:5; 23:6 , a sect exceedingly zealous for the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Pharisees were proud of their superior sanctity of life, devotion to God, and knowledge of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>G. Persecuting the Church</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>out of Zeal for the Law</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Out of zeal for the law and Judaism, Paul persecuted the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Paul says, as to zeal, persecuting the church, he refers to zeal for the law of Moses and the Jewish religion Gal 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those Jews who persecuted the church were certainly among the leading ones in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No one could surpass them in their zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul boasted in his zeal in persecuting the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>H. Blameless according to the Law</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Finally, Paul says that as to the righteousness which is in the law, he was found, or proven, blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This, of course, was in the eyes of man according to man s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the eyes of God, according to His righteous law, no flesh is blameless Gal 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul presented this list of qualifications for the purpose of showing the Philippians that they should not have any trust in the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul once had been a leading Judaizer, but a radical change had taken place in him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now he was very different from what he had been before.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This was a strong indication to the believers in Philippi not to follow the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul s word in 3:1-6 is also related to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Had Paul remained a Judaizer, it would have been impossible for him to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But because he became another kind of person, one who served by the Spirit of God, boasted in Christ Jesus, and had no confidence in the flesh, he could enjoy Christ and experience Him in a very rich way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We also should be those who have no confidence in the flesh, in our natural ability, or in our heritage or tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, we should be those who serve God by the Spirit, who boast in Christ, and who put no trust in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are such persons, we shall have the genuine experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although we are not Judaizers, in principle we may actually be the same as the Judaizers were.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even though we have been regenerated, we may continue to live in our fallen nature, boast in what we do in the flesh, and have confidence in our natural qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have pointed out that in 3:2 the dogs, the evil workers, and the concision refer respectively to the fallen nature, deeds, and religion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we continue to live according to our old nature, boast in what we do in ourselves, and have confidence in our qualifications, we shall be the same as the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As a result, we shall cause problems in the church, and we shall not be able to progress in the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order to experience Christ, we must serve by the Spirit of God, not by our fallen nature; boast in Christ, not in our own doings; and not trust our natural qualifications, but trust only in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a secret to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may consider within ourselves that we are different from the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we may still live in our old nature, boast in our deeds, and have trust in our natural qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not have the assurance that most of the saints fully condemn their fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead, many may still live, move, and act according to the dog nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, to some extent at least, we may still boast in our deeds, considering ourselves intelligent and capable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, we also may have confidence in our flesh, in our natural qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is important that we all be deeply and personally touched by these verses in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need the Lord s light to shine on us concerning our nature, our deeds, and our confidence in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we are enlightened by the Lord, we shall confess that although we have been regenerated to become children of God with the divine life and nature, we still live too much in our dog nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yes, we have a right to proclaim the fact that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if this declaration is contrasted with our daily experience, it may be little more than a doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day, when the light shines on you concerning this, you will want to prostrate yourself before the Lord and confess how unclean your nature is.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then you will condemn everything you do by your fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You will see that in the eyes of God whatever is done in the fallen nature is evil and worthy of condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Formerly, we boasted in our deeds and qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the time will come when instead of boasting in the flesh with its qualifications, we shall condemn it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we shall boast in Christ alone, realizing that in ourselves we have absolutely no ground for boasting.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Only when we have been enlightened by God shall we be able to say truly that we have no trust in our natural qualifications, ability, or intelligence.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only then shall we be able to testify that our confidence is wholly in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After we are enlightened in this way, we shall be able to experience Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope that many among us will see this light and turn from a mere objective understanding of these verses to the subjective enjoyment and experience of Christ.</S>
