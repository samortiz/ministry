   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Teaching Others to Serve God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Properly and Conscientiously</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I must speak a frank word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to speak honest words to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past a certain person may have been loose, and you may have let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But you cannot do that any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If a person does not do his job, you cannot let him go; you have to compel him to work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After he has agreed to work, you still have to ask, "Why are you so loose?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why would you not be careful in taking care of the things of God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Who told you to hand over yourself to be a child of God in the first place?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as you are His child, you have to serve, and you have to serve in a conscientious way.''</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Perfecting of the New Believers Conducting the New Believers' Meetings by Districts</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to conduct the new believers' meetings in the districts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is because many live too far away and cannot otherwise attend this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Presently, we consider everyone to be a new believer, and we are giving make-up lessons to all.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among the brothers we have selected twenty to do the teaching work in the thirteen districts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The subjects covered in the thirteen districts are the same, and their contents are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This meeting is set up specifically for the perfecting of the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those Who Are Absent</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Needing to Receive Make-up Lessons</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The ones who are responsible for visiting the new believers should go out on Friday evening to give make-up lessons to those who were absent the previous week.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In giving the make-up lessons, you have to do a detailed job.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then a person will receive the same teachings, whether or not he comes to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, Brother Cheng may give a message for two hours with sweat all over him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After he finishes, he still has to go to the home of a brother who is absent from the meeting to give him a make-up lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Someone may say, "Brother Cheng has put in so much effort to give his message already.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When others do not come to the meeting, he still has to spend time to give make-up lessons.''</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By saying this, the one who has been absent from the meeting will say, "That is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Next time I think I have to come to the meeting.''</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of work is most definite and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everywhere we go, we will find out right away the things that are wrong with that place, and we will be able to make up the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we practice this, our work will not be as confused and uncoordinated as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Caring for the Poor The Lord's Commandment</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are three kinds of people among us: first, sinners; second, new believers; and third, the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is never free from having a relationship with the poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If anyone feels happy about offering money to the Lord but unhappy about giving money to the poor, he is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is wrong to leave the ointment in the alabaster box; we should offer it up to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is right for us to take care of the Lord and His work first.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But after the alabaster box is poured out, the Bible tells us to sell everything we have and give it to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Caring for the poor is also a commandment of the Lord Luke 12:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A Practice of the Church in the Time of Revival</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In church history we see that whenever there was a revival, there was the practice of caring for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Strictly speaking, it is a small thing for a poor person to eat more or eat less, to have more clothing or less clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But it is a serious thing for a Christian to become narrow in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you want to spend all your money and do not want it to become a hindrance to you, the way is very simple; all you have to do is catch the time of a church revival and go to the Lord and offer up all you have.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you do this, your money will not become a hindrance any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Normal Work of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Caring for the poor is not just the work of the church at the time of revival; it is also the normal work of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is part of a Christian's daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We hope that the brothers and sisters would go home and bring back what they have to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We want everything, new and old.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have brothers and sisters who can wash, sew, and mend these things, and who can distribute them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every time the church receives some money from the offering box, it should set aside a certain amount for the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need one brother and one sister who are designated for this relief work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is good if some can give good messages.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But if you cannot give a good message, it is equally good if you can give away your belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to learn to be those who are led away to the lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If the ones who receive our help are saved, that is an additional blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But even if they are not saved, you will still receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the things in the brothers' and sisters' homes that they do not need should be sent away to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If your house is cleared of all these things, you may end up having fewer burdens to bear.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some people may have their backs bent over by the burden of these things.</S>
