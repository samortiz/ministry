She could believe even when she had nothing in her pocket. Every time I was with her, she always said that she was down to the last dollar in her pocket. Although she lived in the countryside for many years, she never experienced any financial difficulties. When she spoke on the victory of Christ, there was the real manifestation of the victory of Christ. But in other aspects, she was not as strong as her faith.</P><P>Does this mean that Christians can be divided into four categories: the zealous kind, the faithful kind, the knowledgeable kind, and the life kind? May we not have the intention of criticizing others, but may we gain some benefit from this study. We are not separating people into categories in an intentional way. We are merely saying that naturally there are these four groups. These are not differences in sins but differences in good things. When a man develops himself in a certain area and becomes more advanced in that area, those who come in contact with him will feel that he is excellent in a certain, particular aspect. Some may be the zealous kind, while others may be the faith kind. Some may belong to the knowledge group, while others may belong to the life group. As long as one has special growth only in one area, his growth will be distorted. Either he has to continually advance in certain points or continually advance in some other points. It is difficult to find a four-sided Christian who is advancing on all four sides.</P><P>I admit that the holiness group of believers have certain virtues in certain areas. They pay a great deal of attention to life. Men like John Wesley were excellent in their growth in life; the beauty that was manifested in their life is unmatched. They knew God very well. But one does not find many among them with deep and profound knowledge. They were lacking in knowledge. They were good at faith and zeal, but they were still short in knowledge.</P><P>Among the so-called Brethren, you can find one interesting phenomenon. Their specialty is not faith. I do not mean to say that they have no faith. Their specialty is not life. I do not mean to say that they are poor in life. Even more their specialty is not zeal. They seem to be somewhat cool for gospel preaching. Yet they are particularly strong in knowledge, Bible teaching, and the light and revelation they have received from God. They are particularly gifted in the aspect of knowledge.</P><P>The founder of the China Inland Mission, Mr. Hudson Taylor, was a man of great faith. At the beginning when he started the China Inland Mission, he only had a few sterling pounds in his pocket. He deposited this money into the bank under the name of the China Inland Mission. This was the beginning of the China Inland Mission. Today they receive offerings about every minute. At the beginning, only a few went to the China inland to preach. Even while the money in his hands was only enough to support a few people, he prayed that God would send more men to China. First he asked God to send a few, then a few dozen, and finally a few hundred. He was very advanced in faith and zeal. He was also very good in life. But in knowledge, he was not very outstanding.</P><P>Mr. George Muller was also a person advanced in faith and life. But his specialty was not the light of the truth. He was very good in life and zeal. But his specialty was his faith.</P><P>As for zeal, we can find many people who are very zealous in China and in other countries. For example, the first person to come to China, Mr. Robert Morrison, was very zealous. But he was stronger in zeal than in other areas.</P><P>I present all these cases to you to draw your attention to the fact that we should not be one-sided. This is not what God is after. If a person is good in knowledge, we receive help from him. He may not be that zealous, but we should not therefore consider that zeal is unimportant. A bad thing among believers today is that some do not want knowledge at all, while others do not pay attention to life at all. Those who emphasize life but not knowledge think that it is all right even if one does not know anything. Those who emphasize knowledge but not life can lose their temper as soon as they finish their preaching. While their temper is still with them and the redness still on their face, they can sit down and immediately start teaching again. Brothers, we should not pay attention only to others' shortcomings. But at the same time, we should not pay attention only to others' virtues. Someone may be good in knowledge but not good in life. Others may be good in faith but inadequate in zeal. Still others may be good in life but not preach the gospel to others. Some are good in faith, and you should follow their faith. Some are good in knowledge, and you should follow them in their knowledge. Some are good in life, and you should follow them in life. Some are good in zeal, and you should follow them in zeal. If you want to be a four-sided Christian, you should pursue all four things.</P><P>Faith enables us to receive God's power. Knowledge enables us to know the things of God. Life enables us to express God's love and light. Zeal enables us to bring God to men and give God's salvation to men. Whenever there is the opportunity, we should pass out gospel tracts, and we must testify to our colleagues, family members, and children. If we only emphasize one of these four aspects, we are an unturned cake.</P><P>Furthermore, we should be people who experience answers to our prayers. A believer once told me that prayers are for children and that grown-ups do not have to pray. This is a joke. Saying that one can advance from getting answers to prayer to not getting answers to prayers and advance from God answering prayers to God not answering prayers is like "advancing" from a grown-up to a child! Those who say this think that they have advanced. They may have advanced in knowledge but certainly not in faith. If a Christian never has his prayers answered, we cannot say that he is an experienced person. Every Christian must experience some answers to prayers. Faith is always indispensable. In the church, there are not a few who have knowledge, zeal, and even life. But the greatest lack is those who have faith. It is easy to find growth in other aspects. But it is difficult to find growth in faith.</P><P>Furthermore, knowledge is also very important; it has its place. If a Christian does not know the basic truths of the Bible, if he is ignorant of the principles of God's work, and if he does not understand the general outlines of the Bible, he will take in all kinds of doctrines. For example, in the matter of baptism, someone may tell him to be baptized with his face looking downward because the Lord lowered His head on the cross. He may think that this is very reasonable. But if he has biblical knowledge, he will see that the Lord lowered His head on the cross, not in the tomb. If all one cares for is scriptural quotations and does not ask for what purpose they are quoted, he may end up lowering his head even when he eats. Many believers have been listening to messages for one, two, or even five years. If anyone asked them about the difference between justification and salvation, they would say that the two things are more or less the same. They do not know what justification is and what salvation is. To them forgiveness and salvation are more or less the same. In fact, everything is more or less the same. Only paying attention to faith is to be cooked on one side; it is to be an unturned cake. Those without knowledge do not know how to go on and do not know how to lead others to go on because they are blind.</P><P>At the same time, we should pay attention to life. We should seek for God and overcome all sins. May God cause us to realize our sins, and may God put our besetting sins under our feet. How many of us can say that we know we have overcome all sins through Christ living in us? If a Christian does not grow, it is because he has not overcome his sins. We should daily deny ourselves and deal with ourselves. Not only do we have to deal with sins every day, but we also have to obey God. We have to allow the Holy Spirit to work within us day by day so that His life can flow out of us.</P><P>I am presenting these four things before all of you. If we want to be a perfect Christian, we have to pursue these four things. We should not pay attention to just one of them, but we should have a balanced development in all four areas. We should not be an unturned cake. We should not only pursue love; we should also pursue knowledge. At the same time, we should pursue faith and zeal so that we can please God. May God bless us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
