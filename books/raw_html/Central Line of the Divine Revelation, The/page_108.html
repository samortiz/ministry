<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. By Participating in the Fellowship<br>of Christ as Our Portion</H2><P>The way to enjoy Christ is by participating in the fellowship of Christ as our portion (1 Cor. 1:2b, 9). First Corinthians 1:2b says, "...to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours." The meaning of the phrase who is theirs and ours is that Christ is the portion of both the saints in Corinth and the saints who "call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place." If I say that a certain thing is mine, I indicate that it is my possession. In the same way, the phrase who is theirs and ours indicates that Christ is the portion possessed by all the saints.</P><P>First Corinthians 1:9 says, "God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord." The fellowship of Christ is the participation in Christ, the enjoyment of Christ. Today, we are participating in Christ. Every day we enjoy Him as our portion. We enjoy the all-inclusive Spirit as the aggregate of the all-embracing blessing of the full gospel of God by participating in the fellowship of Christ as our portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. By Partaking of Christ<br>as Power and Wisdom to Us from God</H2><P>The way to enjoy Christ is also by partaking of Christ as power and wisdom to us from God (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). In order to achieve anything, we need power and wisdom. Power is the ability and wisdom is the way. According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, Christ is wisdom to us from God as righteousness for our past, as sanctification for our present, and as redemption for our future. Christ is first our power, and then He is our wisdom, that is, our way. His being power to us from God means that there is now a transmission taking place from God to us (Eph. 1:19-22). The electricity that flows from the power plant to a building illustrates how power and wisdom are transmitted to us from God.</P><P>Without the transmission of power and wisdom to us from God, we do not have any power or wisdom. Every day the power and wisdom of God are being transmitted from God the Giver to us the enjoyers. In the morning I may be in the transmission, but at noon I may be out of the transmission. We must learn to remain in this transmission hour after hour, day by day, all the time. Power and wisdom are continually being given to us from God. It is not a once and for all matter. Our enjoyment of this continual transmission is the way to enjoy Christ.</P>
