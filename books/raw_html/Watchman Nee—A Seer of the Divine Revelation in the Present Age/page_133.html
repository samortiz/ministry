<P>3)The Ministers was to replace The Open Door. The nature of The Ministers was to help the churches and the serving ones in the matter of knowing the way to serve and to solve the problems in the ministry. Watchman wrote a few words for the publication of this paper in the first issue of July 1948:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>For many years there have been many rumors but little news from the various localities. Many localities have been out of touch with the others. There is a real need for fellowship among the ministers. For this reason, we are publishing The Ministers with the hope that the brothers will understand what we as ministers really are. We hope also to help each other solve the problems related to the ministers. Finally, we hope that through this, the brothers will find out some of the things that are happening among the ministers. In these end times everything is solemn. These days are more urgent than we think. May the Lord have mercy upon us.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>4)The Gospel was to replace The Glad Tidings. The subject matter of The Gospel was the proclamation of the gospel of God, and the content was to be gospel messages, testimonies of salvation, and gospel stories.</P><P>Following the political change in June 1950, The Open Door was resumed with the twentieth issue containing the following announcement:</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Open Door<br>(The Ministers is now combined into this paper)</H2><P CLASS=INDENT1>NATURE: To show the way to serve, to help the serving ones and the churches in the different localities to go on, and to solve the problems of the ministry....</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>ANNOUNCEMENTS: From this year we hope to resume the publication of The Christian and The Present Testimony. Hence, The Way will be merged with The Christian, and The Testimony will be merged with The Present Testimony.</P><P style="text-align:center">________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>This paper continued to be published for three more issues until 1951 and automatically ceased with the arrest of Watchman Nee.</P><P>The Present Testimony was resumed in January 1951 with the thirty-seventh issue and continued for two more issues until April 1951. It also was automatically discontinued with Watchman's arrest.</P><P>The Christian was never resumed.</P>
