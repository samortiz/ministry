   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE WAY FOR THE GOD-MEN TO BE THE OVERCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The way for the God-men to be the overcomers is first to love Christ and follow Him John 21:15-17, 19b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The God-men as the overcomers must also pursue Christ and gain Him Phil 3:12-15 , and they must be conformed to the death of Christ by the power of His resurrection v. 10 . In everything we need to be conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In everything we should be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It should be "no longer I," because the "I" has been crossed out Gal 2:20a .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In ourselves it is impossible for us to be conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, we do have the resurrected Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should rely on the power of His resurrection that we may be conformed to His death in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many times I realized that I was not conformed to the Lord's death in my attitude toward my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After speaking just one short sentence in an unpleasant tone, I realized that I was not conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have repented for such sins nearly every day for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The overcomers also need to live Christ and magnify Him by the bountiful supply of His all-inclusive Spirit Phil 1:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today the Spirit is not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who has the bountiful supply for us to live Christ and magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to overcome, the God-men also need to live with Christ and labor with Him Gal 2:20a; Col 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Finally, they should not live merely an individual Christian life but must live the Body life, a corporate life, and build up the Body of Christ for the fulfillment of God's New Testament economy Eph 4:12, 16; 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE REWARD FOR THE OVERCOMING GOD-MEN, THE OVERCOMERS, IN THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God has prepared all kinds of blessings in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every part, every aspect, and every item of the New Jerusalem is a blessing prepared by God for His chosen and saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, God realizes that many of His chosen and saved ones would not be faithful to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, He has established the principle of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God the Lord came in to call the saved ones to overcome all the things that oppose God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Most of the God-called and saved believers would not listen to this call.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, in the millennium the overcoming believers will be rewarded by participating in the enjoyment of the kingdom, but all the defeated ones will miss the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, because they are not mature in life, God will have to perfect them by disciplining and punishing them during the thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The overcomers will enjoy the blessing of God's complete salvation one thousand years earlier as a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who do not overcome will miss the one-thousand-year enjoyment of the blessing of God's salvation, and they will also be punished by the Lord during that period so that they can be perfected and matured.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some dear saints do not like to be a Christian who takes such a narrow way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They may not like it today, but sooner or later the Lord will force them to like it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have been chosen by Him Eph 1:4; 1 Pet 1:2 ; it is not up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not overcome today, we will have to overcome tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a school all the students must graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they do not study well, they will not graduate with the rest of their class.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nevertheless, eventually they still need to graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, they have to remain in school for another period of time and must be forced to study until they graduate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the thousand years of the millennium the items of the eternal blessing of God's complete salvation will become a reward to the overcomers.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>1 Cor 6:9; Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5 and will partake of the wedding feast of Christ, which will last for one thousand years as a day Rev 19:9; Matt 25:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They will also have their names confessed before the Father and His angels by the Lord Rev 3:5c and will not have their names erased out of the book of life, to have their names erased out of the book of life in the kingdom age signifying a kind of discipline in the kingdom age v. 5b . They will not be hurt of the second death, to be hurt of the second death probably signifying also a kind of discipline in the kingdom age 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the age of the kingdom the overcoming God-men will be rewarded with the participation in the consummation and enjoyment of the New Jerusalem as the Paradise of God in its initial stage in the millennium 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The New Jerusalem will have two stages: the initial stage of one thousand years as a reward to the overcomers, and the consummated stage in the new heaven and new earth for eternity for all the completed, perfected, and matured believers.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the millennium the overcomers will share in the joy of the Lord Matt 25:21, 23 and will also be crowned with the crown, the crown of life and the crown of righteousness Rev 3:11; 1 Cor 9:25; Rev 2:10; James 1:12; 2 Tim 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They will also sit with the Lord on His throne Rev 3:21 and will have authority over the nations 2:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Moreover, they will be priests of God and of Christ and reign with Christ 20:4-6; 2 Tim 2:12 and will eat of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in its initial stage in the millennial kingdom Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The overcomers will also eat the hidden manna 2:17a and be clothed with white garments 3:4-5a .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They will be pillars in the temple of God and never go out anymore 3:12a and will also be given a white stone with a new name written upon it 2:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The overcoming God-men will have the name of God and the name of the city of God the New Jerusalem and the Lord's new name written upon them 3:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They will be given the responsibilities in the coming kingdom Matt 24:47; 25:21a, 23a and will also enjoy the kingdom rest Heb 4:1, 9-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the millennial kingdom the overcomers will enjoy the salvation of the soul, which is the aggregate of all the above-mentioned items Matt 16:25; Luke 9:24; Heb 10:39; 1 Pet 1:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This salvation will be the common portion of all the saints, not in the thousand-year kingdom but in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
