<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNIFICANCE IN THE SEQUENCE<br>OF JOB AND THE PSALMS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Tim. 2:4; 1 Pet. 2:2; 2 Pet. 3:18; Eph. 4:13</H1><P>In this message we will consider the significance in the sequence of Job and the Psalms.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE SEQUENCE OF JOB AND THE PSALMS<br>BEING VERY SIGNIFICANT SPIRITUALLY</H2><P>The sequence of the two books&#151;Job and the Psalms&#151;is very significant spiritually. Since the book of Psalms shows progress beyond the book of Job concerning the divine revelation and concerning our seeking after God, it would not be fitting for the Psalms to come before Job. Spiritually speaking, it is significant that, in the sequence of books in the Scriptures, the Psalms comes after Job.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. A COMPARISON OF THE TWO BOOKS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Book of Job Being a Record<br>of Human Views Based on Human Concepts</H2><P>The book of Job, preceding the Psalms, is a record of human views based on human concepts concerning the relationship between God and man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Bearing Divine Revelation<br>Only concerning the Burnt Offering,<br>God's Judgment, and Some of God's Attributes</H2><P>The book of Job bears no divine revelation except the divine revelation concerning God's redemption through the burnt offering (1:5), God's judgment on man's evil (9:19b), and some of God's attributes.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not Indicating Whether Job<br>or His Three Friends or Elihu Sought<br>to Gain God as Their Attainment and Enjoyment</H2><P>The book of Job does not indicate whether Job or his three friends or Elihu sought to gain God as their attainment and enjoyment. Rather, this book tells us only that Job was a perfect and upright man who feared God (1:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Its Contents Being the Expressions<br>of Human Sentiments<br>in Natural Views and Concepts</H2><P>The contents of the book of Job are the expressions of the human sentiments of Job, of his three friends, and of Elihu in their natural views and concepts. In this book there is no prayer or praise offered to God. Furthermore, there is no hint that Job, his three friends, and Elihu had any kind of thirst for God. In contrast to the psalmists, they did not seek God, pant after God, pray to God, or wait on God.</P>
