   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD GROWING OUT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before the seeking one became a garden, she never grew anything for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There was much appreciation, enjoyment, and partaking, but she herself never grew anything.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter one, she appreciated the Lord as a bundle of myrrh and as a cluster of henna flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then in chapter two, she enjoyed the Lord as the apple tree, and she was brought into the house of wine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She greatly appreciated and enjoyed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter three, she was even perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, that is, she was permeated and mingled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She appreciated the Lord, she enjoyed the Lord, and she was even permeated with the Lord, but she never grew anything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not until she becomes a garden that she begins to grow something.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse Thy plants are a paradise of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; henna flowers, with spikenard, spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices" 4:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before she became a garden, she enjoyed the Lord as the myrrh, the henna flower, and the frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now she grows what she enjoyed, but it is no longer for her it is for others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now the frankincense is not for her satisfaction, but for the Lord's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The henna flower is not from the Lord for her appreciation, but it is grown out of her for the Lord's appreciation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first aspect, everything was for her, but now everything is for the Lord and for others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At first it was something of the Lord getting into her; now it is something of the Lord growing out of her, because all of these things have been wrought into her, have permeated her, and have become a part of her.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A CORPORATE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By the time she becomes a garden, it is no longer an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can never satisfy others unless we are built up into a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot grow the things we appreciate, enjoy, and with which we are permeated without being fully built up as a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is why we need the second aspect of the Christian life, the corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is what the Lord is looking for today.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not seeking some individually spiritual and mature persons; He is seeking a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christianity has damaged the entire situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have all been spoiled by the wrong concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why we need the eyes of a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the concepts we have received from Christianity need to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No matter what we received from the past, we must realize that the Christian life is not for the individual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Christian life is for a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regardless of how high our attainment might be, though it be to the mountaintop of Lebanon, it should never be for ourselves individually.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we arrive there, the Lord will tell us to come down to be a garden on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot stay by ourselves on the mountaintop of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must go down to the valley to be built up with others and to grow all the things of the Lord with which we have been permeated.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We need not only to take in, but to grow out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be a garden to grow something for the Lord's satisfaction and be a fountain for others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE TURNING POINTS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the next chapter, we will see another little discrepancy between this seeking one and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is really difficult for us to go on with the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot pursue Him day by day without knowing all the turning points.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Song of Songs is a short book, yet it covers all the turning points of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be a crown with a tower of David is marvelous, but upon arriving at that stage we immediately need a turn; we cannot stay.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need a turn from that attainment to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After staying there for a length of time, we need another attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of the experiences of the Lord's death and resurrection, we will be transferred into His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We will attain to the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension an attainment higher than the former one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we immediately need another turn.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>From the mountaintop of the Lord's ascension, the Lord will call us away to the valley to be a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We cannot be a garden on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must come down to the valley where we can grow something.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Clearly, a garden is for growing things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When the seeking one becomes a garden, she begins to grow all the things she has previously enjoyed of the Lord, such as myrrh, frankincense, and henna flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All these were the very aspects and items of what the Lord was to her.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>She enjoyed and partook of all these things, and now she is growing them for the Lord's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the foregoing chapters she enjoyed all these things, but in the garden the Lord Himself comes in to enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved" 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These are the turning points, and they are also a real exercise in the submission of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We should never think we are so spiritual that we have no further need of learning to submit our will.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will need the exercise of the submission of our will until we get to the New Jerusalem.</S>
