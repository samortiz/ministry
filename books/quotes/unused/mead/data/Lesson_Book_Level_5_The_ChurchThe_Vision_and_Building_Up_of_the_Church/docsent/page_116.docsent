   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But I praise You, You are so fine, balanced, and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I thank You that You live in me, and that I can take You as my person.''</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lord, You are fully for God; You are absolutely for His heart's desire.</S>
