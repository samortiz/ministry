   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWELVE THE COURT OF THE TABERNACLE 3 Scripture Reading: Exodus 27:14-16, 19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the gate of the court of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may think that the gate is the most simple aspect of the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, when we begin to consider this matter, we find that it is not simple at all.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some of the points in this message may be quite new in concept to us all.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE APPEARANCE OF THE GATE</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The first thing I wish to do is to give you an impression related to the appearance of the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In studying the types in the Old Testament, we need to pay attention both to the contents and to the appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The types in the book of Exodus have these two aspects the aspect of the contents and the aspect of appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, the altar of burnt offering has a certain appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, the grating, the rings, and the poles are the contents of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the previous messages concerning the outer court, we saw the contents and the appearance of the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The gate of the court of the tabernacle, like the entrance of any kind of building, has a particular appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The front gate or door of a building bears an appearance that attracts people s attention.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This was also true of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When someone approached the tabernacle from a distance, he could see the gate of the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With this gate there was something representing the appearance of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first impression one would have of the tabernacle and the court was that of the gate and the hangings on the two sides of the gate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not difficult to remember the description of the front of the court.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The front side was fifty cubits in width and had ten pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On each side of the gate was a hanging of linen fifteen cubits long.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Exodus 27:14 and 15 say, And the hangings for the one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>And for the second side shall be hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their sockets three.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verse 16 describes the gate with its curtain: And for the gate of the court there shall be a curtain of twenty cubits, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer; their pillars four, and their sockets four.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we consider the front of the court of the tabernacle, we should pay attention to the numbers three and four.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On each side of the gate, there were three pillars and three sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Furthermore, on each side there were three spaces covered by a hanging of linen fifteen cubits long.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The number fifteen, composed of three times five, signifies the responsibility borne by Christ matching the requirements of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fact that there were three pillars and three sockets on each side signifies that both the base and the standing matched the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Moreover, the two sides of the gate signify a testimony, since two is the number of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we have seen, the gate itself was twenty cubits in length.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There were four spaces for the four openings, and there were four pillars and four sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The number twenty here, composed of four times five, signifies Christ bearing the responsibility for men, the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The four openings with the four pillars and the four sockets signify the gate being open toward men from the four ends corners of the earth see 27:2, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The curtain itself signifies the redeeming Christ as our entrance into God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The blue signifies something heavenly; the purple, something royal; the scarlet, something of redemption; the fine twined linen, something even and of a strong human life; and the work of an embroiderer, the constituting work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we are emphasizing the numbers three and four.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On each side there were three groups of three: three pillars, three sockets, and three spaces.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the gate there were four groups of four: four pillars, four sockets, four spaces, and four openings.</S>
