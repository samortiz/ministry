By Knowing the Surpassing Greatness of God&#8217;s Power toward Them, Which God Wrought in Christ</h2><p>In Ephesians 1:19 Paul prays that we would know &#8220;what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength.&#8221; This power is toward us who believe according to the operation of the might of God&#8217;s strength which He wrought in Christ. This is more than subjective and experiential to us today. God&#8217;s power toward us is surpassingly great. We need to know it and experience it.<p>God&#8217;s surpassingly great power toward the believers may be compared to electrical power that is continually being transmitted from the power plant to our homes for our daily life. In the same principle, the divine power is being transmitted into us continually for the fulfillment of God&#8217;s eternal purpose.<p>Verse 19 speaks of the greatness of God&#8217;s power &#8220;according to the operation of the might of His strength.&#8221; Here Paul speaks of power, operation, might, and strength, using different words to convey something of the vastness of God&#8217;s power to us.<p>The surpassingly great power of God toward us is according to the operation of the might of His strength which He wrought in Christ. God&#8217;s power toward us is the same power that operated in Christ. As the Body we participate in the power that operates in the Head.<h2 class=head5>(1) In Raising Him from among the Dead</h2><p>Ephesians 1:20a speaks of God&#8217;s power which &#8220;He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead.&#8221; The great power that operated in Christ first raised Him from among the dead. This power has overcome death, the grave, and Hades, the place where the dead are held. Because of God&#8217;s resurrection power, death and Hades could not hold Christ (Acts 2:24).<h2 class=head5>(2) In Seating Him at His Right Hand in the Heavenlies, Far above All</h2><p>The surpassing greatness of God&#8217;s power has also seated Christ at God&#8217;s &#8220;right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming&#8221; (vv. 20b-21). God&#8217;s right hand, where Christ has been seated by the surpassingly great power of God, is the most honorable place, the place with supreme authority. The heavenlies here refer not only to the third heaven, the highest place in the universe, where God dwells, but also to the state and atmosphere of the heavens, in which Christ was seated by God&#8217;s power.<p>In verse 21 Paul tells us that Christ has been seated above all rule, authority, power, and lordship and above every name that is named. Rule refers to the highest office; authority, to every kind of official power; power, to the might of authority; and lordship, to the preeminence which power establishes. The authorities here include not only the angelic, heavenly authorities, good or bad, but also the human, earthly ones. The ascended Christ has been seated far above all rule, authority, power, and lordship in the entire universe. Every name that is named refers not only to titles of honor but also to everything that has a name. Christ has been seated far above everything, both in this age and in the coming age.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 189-204) &nbsp; pg 24</div><br></body></html>
