   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>V. 1 TIMOTHY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. The writer s , the place, and the time: This book was written by the apostle Paul to Timothy 1:1-2 around A.D. 65, after being released from his first imprisonment in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He may have been in Macedonia when he wrote it 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. The subject: God s economy concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>C. The background: At this point we need to see something concerning the grouping and the timing of Paul s Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although Philemon is grouped with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, it was actually written earlier, during Paul s first imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul was imprisoned the first time because of the Jews, not because of persecution carried out by the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We know from Acts that Paul appealed to Caesar and this caused him to be sent to Rome, where he was imprisoned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During his first imprisonment, Paul wrote four books: Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, according to the time it was written, Philemon should be grouped with Colossians, Philippians, and Ephesians; however, in content it should be grouped, not with these Epistles, but with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Philemon was written not long before Paul s release from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the book of Philippians he expressed his expectation that soon he would be released and visit the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not long afterward, Paul s expectation was fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having been released, he traveled to Ephesus, where Timothy was, and from Ephesus he went into Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>From Macedonia Paul wrote the first Epistle to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then from Macedonia he went to Nicopolis, where he wrote the Epistle to Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Timothy and Titus, therefore, were written after Paul s release from his first imprisonment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After approximately a year, Caesar Nero suddenly began to persecute Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time, Paul was accused of being the outstanding leader among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was arrested and imprisoned again, this time due to Nero s persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From prison, he wrote the Second Epistle to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter four he indicates to his dear child Timothy that he was ready to depart, to be martyred, to be poured out as a drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During Paul s first imprisonment, the churches were tested.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This test showed that decline and degradation had set in. This decline was altogether due to differing teachings, teachings that were different from the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the reason Paul charged Timothy to war a good warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. The central thought: First Timothy unveils to us God s dispensation concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not easy to present such a brief yet all-inclusive summary of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Only when we dig into the depths of this Epistle do we realize that this is the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we get into the depths of this book, we shall see that it can be summarized as a book which speaks of God s dispensation, His New Testament economy, concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1:4 Paul uses the marvelous term God s dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This dispensation is an economical administration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, it refers to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s economy is revealed in four expressions found in 1 Timothy 3: Great is the mystery of godliness; God was manifested in the flesh; the church is the house of the living God; the church is the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God s dispensation is related to the great mystery of godliness, to the manifestation of God in the flesh, and to the church as both the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God s dispensation is put together with these four matters, we see that 1 Timothy does in fact reveal God s economy concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>E. The general sketch: After the introduction, Paul reminded Timothy that he was left in Ephesus to charge others not to teach differently but to center on God s dispensation which is in faith 1:3-17 . He then charged Timothy to hold faith and a good conscience to keep the faith 1:18-20 . Prayer is needed to carry out God s desire for man s salvation 2:1-7 . Paul pointed out that the brothers and sisters in the church needed to have a normal life 2:8-15 and that the overseers and deacons are needed for the church s administration 3:1-13 . The proper church then functions as the house of the living God and as the pillar and base of the truth 3:14-16 . But Paul predicted the decline of the church 4:1-5 . Therefore, Timothy needed to be a good minister of Christ 4:6-16 and learn to deal with saints of different ages 5:1-16 , with elders 5:17-25 , and with slaves and money lovers 6:1-10 as a man of God 6:11-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1:4 we read of God s dispensation, and in 6:11 Paul uses the expression man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, this book begins with God s dispensation and concludes with the charge to a man of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God s desire is to produce men of God by dispensing Himself into those who believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A man of God is one who partakes of God s life and nature John 1:13; 2 Pet 1:4 and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature 1 Cor 6:17 and thereby expresses Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This corresponds to the mystery of godliness, which is God manifest in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>F. The sections: 1 introduction 1:1-2 , 2 God s economy versus differing teachings 1:3-17 , 3 the faith and conscience needed for the keeping of the faith 1:18-20 , 4 prayer for man s salvation 2:1-7 , 5 the normal living in the church 2:8-15 , 6 overseers and deacons for the church s administration 3:1-13 , 7 the function of the church the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth 3:14-16 , 8 the prediction of the decline of the church 4:1-5 , 9 a good minister of Christ 4:6-16 , 10 dealing with the saints of different ages 5:1-16 , 11 dealing with the elders 5:17-25 , 12 dealing with slaves and money-lovers 6:1-10 , 13 a man of God 6:11-21a , and 14 conclusion 6:21b .</S>
