   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE HANGINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The hangings of the court signify Christ as God s righteousness to be the expression of God s building as its boundary 27:9, 11-12, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ as God s righteousness is both the expression and the boundary of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here we have three important words: righteousness, expression, and boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christ is God s righteousness, Christ is God s expression, and Christ is the boundary of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fine linen signifies God s righteousness, and this righteousness of God is actually Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is God s righteousness becoming righteousness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is our righteousness, and this righteousness is the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This Christ, who is both God s and ours, is the expression of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whenever the tabernacle with the outer court was erected in the wilderness, the people could see white linen as the sphere of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This expression was white, bright, clean, and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There was no mixture, and there was nothing dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tabernacle with the outer court portrayed a sphere where everything was righteousness, the righteousness of God lived out through Christ and now also lived out through His church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The church today must have a proper expression, the expression which is Christ Himself as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The boundary of God s building is such a righteous expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The boundary of the church is the church s expression of Christ to be the expression of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, often there is a shortage of such a boundary or expression among Christians today because they are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are lacking in the living out of Christ to express God in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Ephesians 4:24 Paul speaks of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This new man is actually the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we compare Ephesians 4:24 with Colossians 3:10, we see that the new man will be renewed in the image of God in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The image of God has a twofold expression righteousness and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The new man is renewed in the image of God, which bears the expression of righteousness and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the tabernacle the expression of God s building was righteousness outwardly and holiness inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the outer court there were the hangings of linen signifying God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Inside the tabernacle there was gold.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The boards and the furniture were overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gold signifies God s nature, which is holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Holiness is God s nature, and righteousness refers to God s deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whatever God says and does is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All God s acts are righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, righteousness is the expression of God in His doings, whereas holiness is the expression of God in His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The church today as God s building should have this twofold expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The outward expression of the church should be righteousness, and the inward expression should be holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the outside of the church, others should be able to see an expression of God in righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But from inside the church everything should be golden; that is, there should be the expression of God in His holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The types in the Old Testament give details concerning spiritual things that cannot be described in words.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A picture is often better than words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, you may use thousands of words to describe a person s face and yet still not be able to describe it adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It would be much better to have a picture of the face.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the same principle, the books of the New Testament may not describe in detail certain spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the details it is helpful to consider the types.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the types we can see many points that we cannot find in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In particular, with the tabernacle and its court, we see the expression of God in righteousness outwardly and holiness inwardly.</S>
