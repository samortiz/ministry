THE TWO NATURES OF MAN</h2><p>Since man was made in the image of God, he possesses a <i>good nature</i> that matches God&rsquo;s nature, with virtues such as truthfulness, goodness, loveliness, wisdom, kindness, and valor.</p><p>However, there is also an <i>evil nature</i> in man which wars against his <i>good nature</i>. The Chinese metaphysicists refer to this war as a battle between <i>reason and lust</i>. Throughout history, both in the East and West, those who understand human nature acknowledge the existence of this <i>evil nature</i> which the Bible calls:</p><h2 class="head2" style="text-align:left">2. SIN</h2><p class="indent1">Because sin is in man, he is unable to carry out his good intentions.<br />No one likes to be greedy, jealous, or murderous.<br />No one likes to be boastful, arrogant, or deceitful.<br />No one likes to be irritable, licentious, or lustful.<br />No one likes to murmur, complain, or curse.</p><p>Nevertheless, man cannot escape his <i>evil nature</i>. Please read the following verses:</p><h1 class="scripture" style="font-weigh:bold">&ldquo;For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to do the good is not.&rdquo;<br />Romans 7:18</h1><h1 class="scripture" style="font-weight:bold">&ldquo;But if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that do it but sin that dwells in me.&rdquo;<br />Romans 7:20</h1><p>This is a portrait of man.</p><h2 class="head2" style="text-align:left">3. THE FALL OF MAN</h2><p>Sin entered into man and caused him to fall. See diagram below:</p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/MystHumanLife/sin.gif" width="302" height="200" alt="Sin" border="0"></div><p>(1) Sin caused man&rsquo;s spirit to be deadened:</p><h1 class="scripture" style="font-weight:bold">&ldquo;And you, being dead in your offenses and sins.&rdquo;<br />Ephesians 2:1</h1><p>(2) Sin caused man&rsquo;s mind to rebel:</p><h1 class="scripture" style="font-weight:bold">&ldquo;And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by evil works.&rdquo;<br />Colossians 1:21</h1><p>(3) Sin caused man&rsquo;s body to sin:</p><h1 class="scripture" style="font-weight:bold">&ldquo;Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body to obey its lusts.&rdquo;<br />Romans 6:12</h1><p class="indent1">The fallen man is like:<br />A damaged and untunable radio which cannot receive and play music, but rather meaningless noise.</p><p class="indent1">He is also like:<br />A cup that has fallen into the gutter still having its original fine form but now covered with mud.</p><h2 class="head2" style="text-align:left">4. MAN CANNOT SAVE HIMSELF</h2><p>Throughout history, man has tried every possible way to escape sin, but he has found that:</p><p class="indent1"><b>Good works</b> cannot save him from sin.<br /><b>Education</b> cannot save him from sin.<br /><b>Ethics</b> cannot save him from sin.<br /><b>Chanting</b> cannot save him from sin.<br /><b>Religion</b> cannot save him from sin.</p><p>This picture of man simply depicts the battle between his good nature and his evil nature.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> </body></html>
