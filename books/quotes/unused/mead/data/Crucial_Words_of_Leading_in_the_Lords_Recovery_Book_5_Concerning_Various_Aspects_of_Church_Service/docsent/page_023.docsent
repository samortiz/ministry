   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CONCERNING THE COMMUNITY GOSPEL FOUR LINES OF THE GOSPEL The Gospel in the Homes</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to divide the gospel into four lines.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first line is the gospel in the homes, which we should promote in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to encourage every brother and sister in the small groups to open their home.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should encourage all the saints, whether they are strong, weak, or only occasionally attend a meeting, to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some small groups have already begun to promote this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are not promoting the preaching of the gospel in the small groups; we are encouraging every saint in a small group to open his home and preach the gospel in his home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There may be two to four families in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are encouraging the brothers and sisters to preach the gospel in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to my observation, many small groups have already begun preaching the gospel as a group.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our initial intention in promoting the opening of the homes was to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The small group has many functions.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>First, it maintains the existing brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It also recovers the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Finally, it encourages the saints to preach the gospel in the small group, in their homes, and in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not be mistaken and think that we are promoting the preaching of the gospel as a group.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our intention is to encourage the saints to preach the gospel in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose there are nine saints in a small group from five homes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should encourage each of these homes to open for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not be concerned whether our promoting will be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should simply promote this matter; we will consider the next step if our promoting does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In our leading of the small groups, we are promoting every home to open and preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How long it will take for this to be successful is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every home will not open immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It may be that out of five homes none will be willing to open, or it may be that only one home is willing to open.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We only need to keep the principle in the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Matthew 25 the Lord spoke of a slothful slave who managed his master s possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the master returned, the slave said, Behold, you have what is yours v. 25 . He boasted to his master that he did not lose any money.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The slave thought that he had done a good thing because he guarded his master s money and did not lose anything.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, his master reproached him as an evil and slothful slave.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The slave said, Master, I knew about you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not winnow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>And I was afraid and went off and hid your talent in the earth vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The master replied, You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore you should have deposited my money with the money changers; and when I came, I would have recovered what is mine with interest vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every person who serves the Lord should know that the Lord desires us to reap where nothing was sown and to gather where there was no winnowing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We might think that the Lord Jesus is unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Yes, the Lord is unreasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord does not reason according to our reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He has His own reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One day we will stand before the judgment seat, and our excuses will not be accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more excuses we give, the more we will be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord will reprimand us as evil and slothful slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should not say that we have already spent our energy to bring the brothers to the meeting, and now it is too difficult for us to spend more energy to promote preaching the gospel in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Asking the saints to open their homes may not be as difficult as it seems.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should encourage them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We do not lose anything by encouraging the saints to open their homes to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not suffer any loss.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In carrying out the Lord s commission, we should not bargain with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have negotiated with the Lord in the past, telling Him that this or that could not be done.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, I discovered that when I did not negotiate, I spent only ten percent of my energy, but the more I negotiated with the Lord, the more I had to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, I still had to do everything according to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Later, if the Lord asked me to do something, I did it without any bargaining.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The least costly way is to accept the Lord s command and put it to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We are good at bargaining, but the Lord is never bothered with our bargaining.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord does not bargain.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, the more we bargain, the more we pay.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Those who know the Lord understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If the Lord says to do something, we should do it quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It does not matter whether we succeed or not.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our attitude should be that we go when the Lord wants us to go, and we do what the Lord wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the spirit of a serving one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to encourage the saints to open their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The homes may not open immediately, but we should not be discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is still time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If no home opens this week, we will encourage the saints next week.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are fifty-two weeks in a year, and as long as we are steadfast, every home will be open one day.</S>
