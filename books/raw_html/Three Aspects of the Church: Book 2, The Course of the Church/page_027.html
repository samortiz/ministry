<h1 class="title">ASSISTANCE AND HINDRANCES<br />
TO THE COURSE OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE STORY OF HUMANITY&mdash;<br />
RELIGION, CULTURE, AND GOVERNMENT</h2>
<p>From the day the church was produced, it has been assisted and hindered in many ways. In order to have a thorough knowledge of the course of the church, we need to know what conveniences and problems it has encountered. Without knowing this, it is difficult to understand the course of the church, because the course of the church is very much related to the assistance it has received and the hindrances it has encountered.</p>
<p>In analyzing the course of the church, it is easy to see that it has been assisted and hindered in certain ways. The assistance and the hindrances come from the same source, that is, from humanity itself. These things are not only part of the history of the church but also are a factor in the situation of the church today. They are not only instructive but also are warnings to us.</p>
<p>Since the church comes out from humanity and exists among human beings, it cannot avoid having a relationship with humanity. The fact that the church comes out of the human race is typified by Rebecca (Gen. 24), and its existence among human beings is typified by Asenath (41:45). Moreover, the spread and growth of the church are also in humanity. To use an unpleasant term, the church is a &ldquo;parasite&rdquo; in humanity. Without humanity, there is no church; if humanity were destroyed, the church could not exist. Therefore, the relationship between the church and humanity is deep, close, and marvelous. The church came into existence in humanity, and although it is called out from humanity, it is kept by God among human beings. Therefore, we must research the story of humanity in order to understand the assistance and hindrances that the church receives from human beings.</p>
<p>Human history can be broken down into the three broad categories of religion, culture, and government. Items like education, art, and sports fall into the category of culture. Some historians have said that Western history is a matter of Hebrew religion plus Greek culture and Roman politics; these three elements comprise Western culture and are the story of the Western peoples. Although Eastern culture is not a combination of Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics, it is still a matter of religion, culture, and politics. Moreover, in recent times Eastern culture has been influenced by the West.</p>
<p>When the church was produced, it immediately encountered Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics. When the Lord was crucified, a notice was posted on the cross: &ldquo;JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS&rdquo; (John 19:19-20). It was written in three languages&mdash;Hebrew, Latin (Roman), and Greek. This illustrates that while the Lord was on earth, He was dealing with an age composed of three factors: Hebrew religion (Judaism), Greek culture, and Roman politics. The Jewish religion was well-established and was flourishing among the Jewish people. Furthermore, the Jews built synagogues for the reading of the Old Testament in all the places to which they had been scattered. Sometimes even the Gentiles went to the synagogues to listen. Thus, Judaism was deeply rooted and widespread in the region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection and the producing of the church, Greek culture was prevalent in the area around the Mediterranean Sea. The Mediterranean region was a bustling center of humanity. The Mediterranean Sea was in the middle of humanity; it was surrounded by human culture. The New World had not yet been discovered, and northern Europe was a barbarian land. The eastern regions of Asia were another world. If we exclude the Chinese, all the rest of humanity surrounded the Mediterranean Sea as a &ldquo;lake.&rdquo; On the northern shore was Europe, to the south was Africa, and on the eastern shore was the western part of Asia. Although the European, Asian, and African people in these regions had various languages and cultures, they all accepted Greek culture by the time the church was produced.</p>
<p>Students of history know that culture follows water, first by a river, then to the sea, and finally to the ocean. When the church was produced, the oceanic culture was not yet in existence; there was only the culture of the Mediterranean Sea. It is difficult to say how many languages were spoken by the peoples surrounding the Mediterranean, but Greek culture had spread to the entire region. Thus, the New Testament was written in Greek rather than Hebrew, despite the fact that most of it was written by Jewish apostles. All the people surrounding the Mediterranean Sea accepted Greek culture and could understand Greek.</p>
<p>Furthermore, by the time the church came into existence, the Roman Empire governed the entire region surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Almost any area that had Jewish religion and Greek culture also had the politics of the Roman Empire. Therefore, human culture at that time was a mixture of Jewish religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics. Without these three things, human beings at that time would not have been much different from beasts. Religion, culture, and politics separated them from the animals.</p>
<p>Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and Roman politics afforded the church many conveniences. This assistance was prepared beforehand by God.</p>
