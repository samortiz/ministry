   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE AGE HAVING CHANGED THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING THE LORD S WAY TODAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These dear brothers and sisters are not only reluctant to speak; they simply cannot understand what this Brother Lee has been doing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the end of last year when he came back to us, he has changed around our perfectly good big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is so comfortable to sit in a big meeting to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But now he has divided us up and has put eight or nine of us into a home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the same time he repeatedly exhorts us and forces us to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am not interested in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I just wish that we could go back to the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Are these not words that are in your hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am very sympathetic towards all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I know that you are all either very busy with your jobs, pressed by obligations, or entangled in household affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You are tied up from Monday until Saturday.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally the long awaited Sunday is here, and all you want to do is relax a little bit in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You like to listen leisurely to others singing, praying, and reading the Bible to you followed by having a good message delivered to you.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How comfortable this is!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But now, Brother Lee has changed our meetings around.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now we have to go to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no one there who can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is no one there who can give a message.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we read, we have to pray-read, repeat-read, explain-read, and a lot of other things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On top of that we still have to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am not a professional preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have never been to a seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is killing me!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although such words have not come out of your mouth yet, I am not a dumb man; I have been a doctor in this line for fifty-nine years.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I have much bedside experience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I look at your faces and check around a little bit, I know immediately where your sickness lies.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not believe too many of you would say, We agree wholeheartedly with the way of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are for speaking in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if I cannot speak, I will still learn to speak and to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Dear brothers and sisters, let me say this to you: The age has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today this is the way that the Lord has taken.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Bible shows us clearly that at Pentecost, immediately after the Holy Spirit was poured out, when men were saved and the church was established, the home meetings were there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every one of them preached Jesus, spoke about Jesus, and taught others concerning Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The book of Acts tells us that the word of the Lord grew and was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The situation then was different from what we have today.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have been preaching the word in Taiwan for thirty-six years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the word of the Lord is still not prospering here in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is because there are few who speak; there is not much speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now we all have to rise up to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everyone must come to speak the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the characteristic of the home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE WAY OF BLESSING BEING TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>IN THE MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Numbers 11:29 Moses said, Oh that all Jehovah s people were prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Not only did Moses say this in the Old Testament; in the New Testament Paul gave a clearer word: For you can all prophesy one by one 1 Cor 14:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To the Corinthians Paul said, Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy v. 1 . Here it says we have to pursue love and to desire earnestly spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But more than that, we have to desire to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do you realize that you must speak?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a big loss not to be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The home meeting is to afford you an opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All the mothers know that no child is born with the ability to give a long speech.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A child learns to speak by practicing every day.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After a few years he will speak properly and will be able to express himself adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Speaking is just like writing; if you do not practice it, you will forget it as time goes by.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not think that because you cannot speak, you should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if we cannot speak, we should still keep on talking.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The more we speak, the more we will be able to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You have to realize that there is a big difference between speaking and not speaking in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you are under a powerful speaking ministry which ministers the Lord s word to you, and you are being moved and edified, your experience tells you that even to say a small Amen from your heart will make a big difference.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some brothers and sisters may have been meeting with us for ten, fifteen, or even twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not only do they refuse to speak; they would not even say an Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once these perpetually silent ones open their mouths and say an Amen, they will be nourished and edified; they will sense something special.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If they would go further to stand up in the meeting to speak a few words, their speaking will give them immediate comfort, joy, nourishment, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This will be much better than listening to a few messages.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I believe many of you here have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This proves that to speak in the meetings is a way of blessing.</S>
