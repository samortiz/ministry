   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. At the Completion of the Nazarite's</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Days of Separation, the Nazarite Being Brought</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to the Entrance of the Tent of Meeting,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Nazarite Bringing His Offerings to God</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"This is the law for the Nazarite, when the days of his separation have been completed: he shall be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and he shall bring his offering to Jehovah" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>13-14a .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In ancient times, the Nazarite's separation lasted for seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Bible seven days indicate a full course, even a whole lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, in Genesis 1 we have seven days six days for God's work in creation and one day for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, the Passover was followed by the feast of unleavened bread, a feast that lasted seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The seven days of this feast signify the whole course of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At the completion of the Nazarite's seven days of separation, he was to be brought to the entrance of the tent of meeting, and he was to bring his offerings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Each of these offerings was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The enjoyment of Christ as these offerings indicates the overcoming of natural affection, earthly pleasure, rebellion, and death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One Male Lamb a Year Old</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>without Blemish for a Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Nazarite was to bring "one male lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering" v. 14b . Here "male" signifies strong, "lamb" signifies meek, "a year old" signifies fresh, and "without blemish" signifies without defects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This lamb for a burnt offering typifies Christ as our burnt offering that we may be acceptable to God in Him and live to God by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For us to be in Christ means that we are one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>First we are in Him, and then we live to God by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we offer such an offering, we lay our hands on the offering to indicate that we identify ourselves with the offering, making ourselves one with the offering.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, our offering is not merely Christ Himself but also ourselves identified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Apart from Christ, we cannot offer anything that can be accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In order for God to accept us, we must be offered to God with Christ in such a way that we make ourselves one with Christ as the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Numbers 6 the completion of the Nazarite's days of separation signify not an ending but a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This beginning is the beginning of a life of the burnt offering, a life absolutely, utterly, and ultimately for God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that when we offer the burnt offering to God, laying our hands on the offering and making ourselves one with the offering, we promise God that from that time we will be just like this offering, living a life absolutely for God in the seven days of the vow of the Nazarite.</S>
