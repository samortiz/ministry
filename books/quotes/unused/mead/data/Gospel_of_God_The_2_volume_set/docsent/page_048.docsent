   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE GOD'S RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the previous meetings we have seen that man has sinned and that God's salvation is based on the fact that man has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If man had not sinned, there would be no need for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since man has sinned, God has given the law to show man that he has sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's law came to the world to cause man's transgressions to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, man had only sin; he did not have transgressions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But when the law came, man had not only sin, but transgressions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After man transgresses, he realizes that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank the Lord that though we have sin and though we have transgressed, God, who is love, purposed to give us grace and mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He purposed to do something for us to solve the problems that we cannot solve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this meeting, however, we must see something else.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although God loves us and shows mercy on us and although He fully intends to grant us grace, there is one thing that makes it very difficult for God to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God cannot bestow grace upon us immediately; He cannot give us eternal life directly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a dilemma which God must solve before He can grant grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The problem, which the Bible mentions frequently, is God's own righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The phrase God's righteousness has confused many theologians for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we read the Bible without prejudice and preconceived notions, God will show us what His righteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can see this matter clearly without much difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Tonight we hope to see, by the grace of God, what God's righteousness is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, we hope to see the difficulty God encounters when He saves us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>HIS SALVATION MATCHING HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If God is to save us, He must save us to a condition that matches, or measures up to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If God is to give us salvation, He cannot give it in a manner that conflicts with His nature, His method, and His way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are sinners full of transgressions and, therefore, have no thought of righteousness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we wanted to be saved, we would probably use any means possible, whether straight or crooked, good or bad.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We would try to be saved by any of a thousand and one ways.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as we can be saved in some way, it is good enough for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not care if the procedure is proper or if the method is right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as we are saved, we are satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We could not care less from where the salvation comes, and whether or not it is right.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this sense, we are like thieves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All that a thief cares about is getting the money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He does not care where the money comes from.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as he gets the money, he is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He has no concept of right and wrong; he has no concept of righteousness and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we must realize that salvation is not just a matter of us getting saved, but of God saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although we would be satisfied no matter how we are saved, God cannot say that all there is to salvation is getting us saved, without caring about whether the way we are saved is right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God undoubtedly desires to give us grace and to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without doubt, He wants to give us His life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God is full of love, and He is more than willing for us to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if God is to save us, He has to save us in an excelling way.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, God's saving us is a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God desires to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But what method can He use so that man can be saved in a most righteous way?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What method is most reasonable?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What method will match His own dignity?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is easy to be saved, but it is difficult to be saved righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why the Bible speaks so much about God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It tells us again and again that God saves man in a way that matches His own righteousness.</S>
