   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 11 THE TEMPLE 3 The Course of the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If a person wants to know the significance of the course of the temple, he must understand its origin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The temple was built by David and Solomon.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>David prepared the materials, and Solomon carried out the building work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The origin of the temple, however, did not begin with David and Solomon; its origin was much earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Origin of the Temple</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To determine the origin of the temple, we must consider it according to the significance of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though the temple and the tabernacle are different, their central significance is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They both speak of God s desire to be inwardly joined with man in order to obtain a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God s desire in gaining man can be seen in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, God was unable to accomplish His purpose through Adam and the Adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, God chose a group of people from among His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He chose Abraham and the race of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since Adam, the created man, failed, God turned to Abraham, the called one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This resulted in a change of race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From that point onward, God s goal was no longer related to the Adamic race; it was transferred from the descendants of Adam to the descendants of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the time of Babel, the goal of God s work was with the descendants of Abraham; it was no longer with the descendents of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The called race, the descendants of Abraham, appears at the end of Genesis 11, indicating that God wanted to obtain a dwelling place so that He could dwell with them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nevertheless, it was difficult for God to obtain His dwelling with Abraham as an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in chapter 18 there is a miniature God came to visit Abraham and entered into his tent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This tent can be considered a miniature of the tabernacle that the children of Israel later erected in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham presented cakes of fine flour and a calf to God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was a shadow of the meal offering and the sacrifices that the Israelites would later offer and indicates that God had a new beginning with man and a fresh opportunity to accomplish His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God entered into man s tent to dwell with man, eat with man, and fellowship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a situation was not seen in regard to Adam or Noah and was not attained to even by Abel or Enoch.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God came to eat and dwell with Abraham only after Abraham was circumcised 17:24; 18:1 , indicating that Abraham had learned the lesson of being dealt with and had been delivered from his natural man with the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God led the children of Israel to come out of Egypt, His intention was that His chosen people would live before Him and be a kingdom of priests Exo 19:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that God desired that they be completely separated from the world unto Himself and have direct fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God established the tabernacle so that He might dwell in their midst 25:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Apparently, the tabernacle was God s dwelling but from the spiritual perspective, the children of Israel, who had been separated from the world, were the real dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The tabernacle was merely a symbol, a sign; the children of Israel were the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the condition of the Israelites was proper, the condition of the tabernacle was normal, but when the condition of the Israelites was improper, the condition of the tabernacle became abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, the condition of the tabernacle was determined by the condition of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The children of Israel were the real dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Ark represented God, and the tabernacle represented the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the condition of the Israelites before God was proper, the Ark of God would remain within the tabernacle, but when their condition before God was improper, the Ark was separated from the tabernacle, indicating that God had left the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, when the Ark was taken captive, it was said, The glory has departed from Israel 1 Sam 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Ark s being separated from the tabernacle was God s departure from the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This demonstrates that the origin of the temple and the tabernacle was a group of people gained by God to be His dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without such a group of people, the dwelling place of God would not have an origin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, the origin of the temple is man being gained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Old Testament shows that there are two obvious steps through which God gained man: the priesthood and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the age of the priesthood, there was the tabernacle, not the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The temple did not come into existence until the age of the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The priesthood represents fellowship with God, and the kingship represents the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicates that when man was gained by God and entered into fellowship with God, the tabernacle came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The temple, however, did not exist until God gained man to the extent that man was able to reign for God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the tabernacle and the temple are two aspects of one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They were God s dwelling place among his people in their wandering and in their settling down; one was movable, and the other was set.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This indicates that in the age of the tabernacle, God had not yet gained man in a sufficiently deep and solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man had only reached the stage of fellowshipping with God but not of allowing God to rule among man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, he praised and worshipped God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His praise and worship represent two things: the priesthood and the kingship 2 Sam 6:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At that time David was a king, but he was also girded with an ephod, indicating that he was a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the regulations in the Old Testament, priests came from the tribe of Levi, and kings came from the tribe of Judah; the two were not to be mixed cf.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>2 Chron 26:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a king sought to serve God in the temple, it was a violation of the ordinances of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, when David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, he was a king girded with an ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On that day the king and the priest were one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This indicates that God had gained a man to the extent that the man not only fellowshipped with God but allowed God to reign among men.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God s gaining of a man not only enabled God to have a dwelling place on earth, but it allowed Him to establish His throne in the midst of man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hence, there are three matters related to the origin of the temple: man, fellowship, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Concerning man, we need to trace back to Adam; concerning fellowship, we need to trace back to Aaron; and concerning authority, we need to trace back to David.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, when we speak of the origin of the temple, we need the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Reading from Adam all the way to Abraham, we discover that there were men on earth whom God was able to truly gain.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When created man failed to accomplish God s purpose, the chosen and called ones replaced them and filled the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once God gained these called ones, they fellowshipped with Him and stood before Him wearing an ephod, allowing Him to speak, express His intention, and shine forth through them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is the priesthood, the history of Aaron s descendants.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The priesthood of Aaron was man s obligation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When God created Adam, His original intention was that the entire Adamic race would be priests before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because Adam lost his position, God called Abraham to fill the lack.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When the sons of Abraham went out of Egypt and arrived at the foot of Mount Sinai, God told them that He wanted them to be a kingdom of priests and that every Israelite was a priest Exo 19:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the sons of Abraham also failed, and the Levites came in to replace them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Abraham replaced Adam, and Aaron replaced Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>With Aaron, God gained a group of people who fellowshipped with God, stood before God, conversed with God, allowed God to express His intention, and afforded God the opportunity to carry out His will in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>At the time of the tabernacle there was only the fellowship of the priests with God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There was not an authority, because the kingship had not yet come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>After the priesthood failed, the ephod was transferred from the priests to Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Samuel was not a priest; he was a Nazarite.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A Nazarite was one who voluntarily consecrated himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The principle of the Nazarite was that a man would cooperate with God and allow God to possess all that he had Num 6:1-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Aaron was chosen and called, but a Nazarite was one who voluntarily consecrated himself.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God s choosing and calling required man s cooperation, but when the chosen and called ones were not willing to cooperate with God, the voluntarily consecrated ones replaced them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Samuel, a Nazarite, replaced the priests at the time of Eli as a result of their degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The ephod was transferred to a Nazarite who was willing to cooperate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Samuel then brought in the authority, which is related to the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After Samuel anointed David, the kingship was produced 1 Sam 16:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Then on the day that David brought the Ark to Jerusalem, the ephod was transferred to him 2 Sam 6:12-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hence, on the day that he stood before the Ark, David possessed a threefold status: he represented man, fellowship, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He was a man girded with an ephod, and at the same time, he was a king possessing authority.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In other words, he was one who had been gained by God, who fellowshipped with God, and who ruled for God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>In David we see man, the priesthood, and the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The result of God gaining such a person was the producing of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is the origin of the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God is able to produce a solid dwelling place among man when there are men on earth fellowshipping with God and allowing God to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Apparently, David and Solomon built the temple, but actually, the temple did not originate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Rather, it originated with man, fellowship, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If no one was gained by God, if no one fellowshipped with God, and if no one allowed God to rule on earth, there would not have been a temple on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is the same in regard to the origin of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The church could not exist on the earth if no one was gained by God, fellowshipped with God, and allowed God to rule.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>These three factors are necessary for the origin of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Thus, whether a church can be established in a certain place depends upon whether God has gained some people in that place who fellowship with Him and allow Him to establish His throne.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If these three factors are present, the church in that place will be solid.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If even one factor is missing, the church cannot be established.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The building of the temple depends upon God gaining a group of people who are girded with an ephod to fellowship with God and who rule for God.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In this way, God is able to establish His throne among man and thus establish a dwelling place on earth in which His glory is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>On the day that Solomon dedicated the temple to God, a glorious scene took place 1 Kings 8:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>On the day of Pentecost, a similar scene took place.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>On that day there were one hundred twenty people who were gained by God, in fellowship with God, and allowing God to rule; hence, the church was produced, and God was able to fill the one hundred twenty with His glory Acts 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The church is neither a doctrine nor an organization; the church is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The degree to which we are gained by God, the depth to which we fellowship with God, and the extent to which we allow God to rule determine the origin of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The reason that the disciples had such power on the day of Pentecost was that the upper room, in which they had prayed, was like an altar of consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>In this upper room one hundred twenty people consecrated themselves to allow God to gain them, to fellowship with God, and to allow Him to rule in them; thus, they became the origin of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>They became God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We need to ask ourselves: When God touches us, are we willing to submit to Him, allow Him to rule in us, and allow Him to gain us?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The outpouring of the Holy Spirit that occurred at Pentecost does not come through crying, praying, and fasting for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Rather, it comes if we are willing to be subdued by God when He touches us strongly and if we are willing to yield to Him in every matter that He has touched.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This enables the Holy Spirit to be poured out upon us and to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The building of the temple depends upon man being gained by God, fellowshipping with God, and being ruled by God.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The origin of the temple required Adam, Aaron, and David.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>It was only through Adam, Aaron, and David that God s temple and tabernacle could come into being among men.</S>
