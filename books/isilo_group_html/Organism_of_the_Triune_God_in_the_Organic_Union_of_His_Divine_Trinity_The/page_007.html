<p>The organic union which is of the divine Trinity is in Christ. Outside of Christ there is no organic union. When we were saved, we believed into Christ. When we entered into Christ, we became identified with Him. Whenever we eat something, what we eat becomes identified with us, and we become identified with it. If I eat some chicken, the chicken gets inside of me and it becomes me. I become identified with the chicken that I eat. Dietitians tell us that we are what we eat. We become what we eat, and what we eat becomes us. According to the Greek language, to believe in the Lord is actually to believe <em>into</em> Him. When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we became identified with Him, and in this sense we became Him. In Christ&rsquo;s death, He identified the redeemed ones with Himself (Rom. 6:8a). According to this truth, to say that we are one with Jesus is not as accurate as saying that we became Jesus. The all-inclusive death of Christ includes us. We died with Him.</p>
<p>According to Romans 6:6, our old man has been crucified with Christ. Christ terminated us when He was crucified. To be crucified means to be terminated, to be ended. When we believed into the Lord Jesus, we became identified with Him and we were terminated. Our history was ended. To believe into the Lord Jesus is not only to be included in Him but also to be ended in Him. Our believing into Him was a kind of suicide for us. When I believed into the Lord Jesus, I was terminated, and my past history came to an end. The formula for our organic union was that we believed into Christ and were included in Him. In this including we were terminated, and this was a preparation for us to enjoy the organic union.</p>
<p>The organic union of the divine Trinity is firstly in the death of Christ and then in His resurrection. On the third day after His death, Christ was raised from among the dead (1 Cor. 15:4). We were also included in His resurrection. In His death we were terminated, and in His resurrection we were enlivened (Eph. 2:5). For Jesus to be crucified and enlivened took about three days. For us who believed into Him, to be crucified and enlivened was instantaneous. At the very second that we called &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we were crucified and enlivened. By calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; our former history ended because our old history was terminated and buried in the tomb, and a new history began. Our old life was ended, and we were living a new life.</p>
<p>In the sixties, some hippies were saved among us and we saw a great change take place in them because of their organic union with the Lord. Calling &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; terminated their former history, the history of a hippie, and began another history, the history of a saved person. As persons who had believed into Christ, they were persons in Christ, identified with Christ, which means that they became Christ. This is what happens when the organic union transpires within a person. Although this organic union is invisible, it is a wonderful reality. Because we were identified with Christ in His resurrection, we were both enlivened and raised up (Eph. 2:5-6a).</p>
<p>This organic union is not only in Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection but also in His ascension. In His ascension He seated us together with Him in the heavenlies (Eph. 2:6b). We need to have the realization that we are now in the heavenlies. We are in the heavenlies because we are in Christ, who is in the heavenlies. Christ is our &ldquo;aircraft.&rdquo; If I am in the aircraft and the aircraft is in the air, then I am in the air.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2 tells us that we have been saved by grace (v. 8). Many Christians think that this merely means that we were not saved by our work but by His redemption, His grace. Actually, to be saved by grace is to be saved by His death, by His resurrection, and by His ascension. Many Christians are expecting to go to heaven, but they do not realize that they were in the heavenlies already. At the very moment we believed into the Lord Jesus and called upon His name, we were in the heavenlies. This is because we became identified with Him by believing into Him. We are still persons living and moving on this earth, but many times we have the deep sensation that we are in the heavenlies. At those times the earthly things cannot touch us because we are transcendent. We are far above all. The other members of our family may be bothered by certain things, but we are soaring above them. We are transcendent because we are people in the heavenlies in the organic union in Christ through His death, resurrection, and ascension.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
