   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD JESUS AS ADVOCATE FOR CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The work of the Lord Jesus as Savior is for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The work of the Lord Jesus as Advocate is for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As the Savior, the Lord Jesus accomplished the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As the Advocate, the Lord Jesus applies the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The sins of sinners are forgiven through the redemption of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sins of Christians are forgiven through the advocacy that is based upon the redemption of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This advocacy presents the work of the cross to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It shows God what the Lord Jesus has done, so that God cannot punish man for his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have an Advocate before God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His death is presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus has become an Advocate for every Christian who sins, in the same way that He has become the Savior for every sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not that first we repent, believe, and are regenerated, and then the Lord Jesus dies for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, it was while we were yet sinners that Christ became our Savior Rom 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the same way, it is not that we first repent, and then He becomes our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, even while we are sinning, He becomes our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not that He becomes our Advocate when we confess our sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, even while we are sinning, He becomes our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why John says that if any man sins, we have an Advocate with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He does not say that first we repent, confess our sins, and pray for forgiveness, and then He becomes our Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Instead, John says that if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father already.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever you sin, at that moment the Lord Jesus is already your Advocate before God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that very moment, the Lord Jesus will show God His work of the cross, and God will have to let your sins go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A Christian can confess and repent because the Lord Jesus is his Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because we have the Lord Jesus as our Advocate, advocating and speaking for us while we sin, we eventually repent, confess our sins, and ask for forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus' work of advocacy does not happen at the moment we repent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, it happens while we are sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we sin, the Lord Jesus is our Advocate already.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Afterwards, we are brought to repentance and confession.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus accomplished all the work in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything is included in that work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today the Lord can present this work to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God can no longer punish us, because all the debts have been paid.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the debts, past and future, are paid.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All our sins have been washed away by the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>WALKING IN THE LIGHT AS HE IS IN THE LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But what should we do on our part?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Let us now go to 1 John 1:7.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>"But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What does it mean to be in the light?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man thinks that to be sinless and to be holy is to be in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But that is not the sense here.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John does not say that we should walk in the light as God walks in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is not said of God here that He walks.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If that had been said, the meaning would be entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It says here that we should walk in the light as He is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the meaning of this difference?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, in this meeting hall there are many light bulbs, but we call them the light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are now sitting in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the other hand, while we are meeting, many people often sit on the stairs next door.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They may not have sinned out there.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They may not have stolen from others out there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Perhaps they are even better and holier than we.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But those who sit in the light can see, while those who sit in darkness cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For God to be in the light means that God can now be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Old Testament, God was shrouded in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He was in the Holy of Holies, and man could not see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the Holy Place there was a lamp, and in the outer court there was the sun, but in the Holy of Holies, there was no light at all.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God was an unknown God there.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Man could only make conjectures about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But thank the Lord that today God has been manifested in Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God is now in the light; He is no longer in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today God is a known God, a revealed God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When you see God today, you know that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The gospel concerning Jesus of Nazareth is the revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The shining out of the light of the gospel is the shining out of God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the light of the gospel shines out, we see God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am not saying that we should not be holy or that we should not reject sin.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am saying that this verse tells us that as God is in the light, we should therefore walk in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As God has manifested Himself in the light of the gospel, even so we should see God in the light of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We no longer look for God in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today God has manifested Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If He had not manifested Himself, we would be hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If He had not manifested Himself, we would still be bewildered, not knowing what kind of God He is.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We would still have to make conjectures about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thank God that He has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Today our God is no longer a "backstage" God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>He is now the "onstage" God, the revealed God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The word revelation is apocalypsis in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Apo means away, and calypsis means veil.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hence, apocalypsis means the taking away of a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>I used to watch theater performances.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Onstage there is always a thick curtain.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>You do not know what is behind the curtain.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>An apocalypsis is the opening up of the curtain.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Today God is in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is an open God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What then should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should walk in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This means we will see God and know God in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Today we do not know God by way of conjecture as those in the Old Testament did.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Today God has spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>There is no need to make conjectures anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Today God is already in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He has already revealed Himself in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we walk in this revelation, the result is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There will be fellowship between Christians, and there will be fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Since we are participants in the gospel and since God is also a participant in the gospel, the blood of His Son Jesus cleanses us from all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we truly know God in the gospel, we will see that the blood of His Son Jesus is continually and eternally cleansing us of all sin 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>In the original language, this verse says that the blood of Jesus His Son is continually cleansing us from all sin.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The Bible never shows us that the blood of the Lord Jesus does a second cleansing work.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It shows us that the blood of Jesus cleanses us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>There are no multiple cleansings.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There is only the continual cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Bible never has the thought of multiple cleansings.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The biblical truth is a continual cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The blood of the Son of God continually cleansing us from our sins is the work of the Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The work of the cross is once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>But the operation of His cleansing and His blood is continuous.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The cross dealt with our sins and washed away our sins only once.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>But it is forever effective.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Why is it forever effective?</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Why is it cleansing us continually?</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>It is because His Son is presenting the accomplished work to God continually.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>It is not a re-cleansing, but a continual demonstration to God that He has died and that all the sins are dealt with already.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Today He is continually cleansing away all of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>All our sins are included here.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The effectiveness of His blood lasts forever because the Lord Jesus is our Advocate continually in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>His work as the Advocate is a continuation and extension of His work as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>The work of the Savior happened only once, but it is continued in the work of the Advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>This is God's side of the work.</S>
