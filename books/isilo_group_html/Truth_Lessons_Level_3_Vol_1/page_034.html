Receiving the Spiritual Gifts</h2><p>The old servant gave Rebekah not only a gold ring but also two gold bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels (Gen. 24:22, 47). Moreover, when the old servant went to Rebekah&rsquo;s house, he brought forth articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment and gave them to Rebekah (v. 53). The bracelets on her hands weighing ten shekels signify that we have received the gifts of life and thus can fulfill the requirements of God&rsquo;s commandments and fully fulfill the heavenly function. The articles of gold, the articles of silver, and the raiment all indicate the riches of Christ. This typifies that the church has received the spiritual gifts and the riches of Christ from the Holy Spirit. At the time of our salvation, we not only receive the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge, but we also receive the spiritual gifts and the riches of Christ from the Holy Spirit for us to carry out the heavenly function and enjoy the riches of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Willing to Forsake Her Relatives<br />and Be Given to Christ</h2><p>After Rebekah received and enjoyed these riches, she was willing to leave her father&rsquo;s house immediately and be given to Isaac (vv. 54-58). This typifies that the church is willing to forsake her relatives in the flesh and be given to Christ. Today, although we have never seen Christ, we are attracted by Him and we love Him (1 Pet. 1:8) because of the Spirit&rsquo;s testifying in us on behalf of Him. Hence, we are willing to forsake the world and our relatives and be given to Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Following the Holy Spirit to Go to Christ</h2><p>After Rebekah decided to leave her father&rsquo;s house to be given to Isaac, she rode on a camel and followed the old servant to go to Isaac (Gen. 24:61). This is a type of the church&rsquo;s following the Holy Spirit to come to Christ. According to Leviticus 11, a camel is unclean, yet it is useful. Many of today&rsquo;s conveniences are not clean in the eyes of God. Nevertheless, through them we can follow the Holy Spirit to travel through the desert to come to Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Being Married to Christ<br />as His Beloved Counterpart</h2><p>One day Isaac went out to meditate in the field at eventide, and he lifted up his eyes and saw that camels were coming. When Rebekah lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, she took her veil and covered herself. Isaac brought her into his mother&rsquo;s tent, took her as his wife, and loved her (Gen. 24:63-67a). Rebekah was married to Isaac at eventide, and she was loved by him. This typifies that at the close of this age the church will be married to Christ as His eternally beloved counterpart (Rev. 19:7).</p><h2 class="head2">G. For Christ&rsquo;s Full Satisfaction</h2><p>After Rebekah was brought to Isaac, Genesis 24:67b says, &ldquo;Isaac was comforted after the death of his mother.&rdquo; Rebekah was given to Isaac and married to him, and the two became one flesh. Thus, Isaac was comforted, and she also enjoyed all the riches which Isaac had inherited from his father. This typifies that the church is given to Christ to become one with Him as His beloved counterpart for His full satisfaction and thus to be able to enjoy all the riches which He has inherited from God the Father.</p><h1 class="title">SUMMARY</h1><p>Isaac and Rebekah are a type of Christ and the church. Isaac inherited all that his father Abraham had and took Rebekah as his wife, who was of his father&rsquo;s house and of his kindred. This is a type of Christ&rsquo;s receiving all that was given to Him by the Father and inheriting all that the Father has, and also of His obtaining the church, which is of the same blood and flesh as He is, to be His beloved counterpart for the satisfaction of His heart&rsquo;s intent.</p><p>As Isaac&rsquo;s wife, Rebekah is a type of the church as Christ&rsquo;s counterpart. Rebekah was chosen to be Isaac&rsquo;s wife by the old servant whom Isaac&rsquo;s father, Abraham, sent to the place from where he was called out by God. This typifies that the church is chosen and prepared by God to be given to Christ. Rebekah received a gold ring from the old servant, typifying that the church has received the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge. The old servant also gave her gold bracelets of ten shekels in weight for her hands; he also brought forth articles of silver, articles of gold, and raiment and gave them to her. This signifies that the church has received the spiritual gifts and the riches of Christ from the Holy Spirit, that she may carry out the heavenly function and enjoy the riches of Christ. After receiving and enjoying the riches, Rebekah was willing to leave her father&rsquo;s house immediately and follow the old servant to go to Isaac and be married to Isaac to be loved by him. He was comforted, and she also enjoyed all the riches which Isaac had inherited from his father. This signifies that the church is willing to forsake her relatives in the flesh and follow the Holy Spirit to come to Christ. Moreover, at the close of this age, the church will be married to Christ to be His eternally beloved counterpart for His full satisfaction and thus be able to enjoy all the riches which He has inherited from God the Father.</p><h1 class="title">QUESTIONS</h1><ol class="decimal"><li>In the case of Isaac and Rebekah, briefly describe the Christ typified by Isaac.</li><li>Briefly explain how Rebekah typifies the church chosen and prepared by God.</li><li>Briefly explain how Rebekah is a type of the church&rsquo;s having received the Holy Spirit as a seal and a pledge and having also received the spiritual gifts.</li><li>Briefly explain how Rebekah is a type of the church&rsquo;s willingness to leave her relatives and follow the Holy Spirit to go to Christ.</li><li>Briefly explain how Rebekah is a type of the church&rsquo;s being married to Christ to be His beloved counterpart for Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction.</li></ol><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 3, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
