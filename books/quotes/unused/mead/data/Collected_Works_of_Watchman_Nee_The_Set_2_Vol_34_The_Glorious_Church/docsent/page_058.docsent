   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord whom John saw was the same in form as the God whom Daniel saw.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"His eyes were like a flame of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fire enlightens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord's eyes are like a flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, He can search the inward parts and the hearts; nothing can be hidden from His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When His fiery eyes see something that is incompatible with His holiness, He judges and condemns it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is the light, and He is also the enlightening.</S>

   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Who can escape the fiery eyes of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What can be hidden before His fiery eyes?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brothers and sisters, we should sing today: "Unto the judgment seat of Christ/I daily look away;/May all my living and my work/Abide the fire that day" see Watchman Nee A Seer of the Divine Revelation in the Present Age, p.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whatever sin is judged by His sharp eyes will be crushed by His strong feet!</S>

   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Psalm 93:3-4 says, "The floods have lifted up, O Jehovah;/The floods have lifted up their voice; /The floods lift up their roaring./More than the voices of many waters,/Than the mighty breakers of the sea,/Jehovah on high is mighty!"</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Indeed, Psalm 29:4 says, "The voice of Jehovah is powerful;/The voice of Jehovah is full of majesty."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the time of judgment, His voice alone will be enough to break man's heart!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since this is the case, the church should fear the Lord and not disobey the Lord's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If it does this, the church will not be ashamed when it meets the Lord face to face.</S>
