   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He was laid in the new tomb which Joseph had hewed in the rock for himself Matt 27:57-60; John 19:38-42 , thus fulfilling the prophecy in Isaiah 53:9 concerning His being buried with the rich.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After He ministered and worked for three and a half years, He was crucified according to the year and date prophesied in the Scriptures, accomplishing an all-inclusive death with a sevenfold status: 1 as the Lamb of God, taking away the sin of men; 2 as a man in the flesh, condemning sin and dealing with the flesh of sin; 3 as the last Adam, a man in the old creation, crucifying our old man on the cross; 4 as a brass serpent, destroying the ancient serpent, Satan, with his world; 5 as the Firstborn of all creation, terminating the entire old creation and reconciling all things to God; 6 as the Peacemaker, abolishing all the separating ordinances of the law; and 7 as a grain of wheat, falling into the ground and dying, thus releasing the divine life that those who believe in Him may become the many grains for the constitution of His Body.</S>
