<h1 class="title">THE WORK GOD DESIRES TO DO<br />
IN THE UNIVERSE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GENESIS 2 BEING A MINIATURE OF THE ENTIRE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Genesis 2:4-25 is a miniature of the entire Bible. At the end of Genesis 2, verse 24 speaks of two persons becoming one flesh, that is, of a husband and wife being joined in marriage. The record at the end of the entire Bible is a record of God and man being joined in marriage (Rev. 19:7; 21:2, 9; 22:17), that is, of God in man being joined with man as one. In the beginning of the Bible, Genesis includes a record of creation, and at the end of the Bible, Revelation includes a record of a marriage. Similarly, at the beginning of Genesis 2:4-25 there is a record of creation, and at the end of this portion there is a record of a marriage. Hence, the record in Genesis 2 is a miniature of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>The seeds of the truths in the entire Bible are included in Genesis 2. At the beginning there is creation, and at the end there is a marriage. In between creation and marriage, the most important matter is God causing a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and building a woman out of one of his ribs (vv. 21-22). In brief, the entire Bible records three great matters: the creation, the death on the cross, and the wedding in the future. The story of the cross includes how God works in order to prepare a counterpart for Himself. These three great matters are all hidden in Genesis 2.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FINAL ISSUE OF GOD&rsquo;S WORK IN THE UNIVERSE<br />
 BEING SEEN IN GENESIS 2</h2>
<p>There are three things in the Bible that are not found in Genesis 2. In Genesis 2 there is no sin, there is no law that was given as a result of sin, and there is even no redemption related to sin. The record in Genesis 2 says only that God took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s side; it does not say that Adam&rsquo;s blood was shed. This is because there was not yet a problem with sin and, thus, no need for redemption.</p>
<p>From the picture in Genesis 2 we can see that the final issue of God&rsquo;s work is that by working the life that is within Himself into man, man becomes His counterpart, His duplication, exactly the same as He is, and God and man are joined as one. This will fulfill God&rsquo;s desire and purpose, and He will be satisfied and have rest for eternity. This is the work that God intends to do in the universe.</p>
<p>Genesis 1:1 through 2:3 is a picture of God&rsquo;s desire, and 2:4-25 is a picture of how God fulfills His desire. These two portions at the beginning of the Bible are like a general blueprint of a building project, and the subsequent books of the Bible are like the detailed drawings of the project. Ultimately, the record in Revelation 21 and 22 represents the ultimate completion of the project. We need to have this realization when we read the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING HELP FROM THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p>What we have presented in these chapters is the essential significance of the Bible. This significance is absolutely related to the line of life. However, I am deeply concerned that some may merely use their mentality to understand these messages. If this is our case, we will not receive much help in life. Therefore, we need to fellowship concerning the way to listen to messages, to read the Bible, and to read spiritual publications.</p>
<p>When we listen to messages, read the Bible, or read spiritual publications, we must be well prepared. The first aspect of this preparation is related to the heart, the second aspect is related to the mind, and the third aspect is related to the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Matter of the Heart</h2>
<p>The first aspect is related to our heart. When we come to the Lord, whether to listen to a message, read the Bible, or read a spiritual publication, we should contact the Lord&rsquo;s word. Therefore, we must have a heart to contact God&rsquo;s word. I dare not say that a person will not receive any help if he has no heart to contact God&rsquo;s word, but such an experience is not common. If we desire to receive help from the Lord&rsquo;s word consistently, we must have a heart to contact God&rsquo;s word. Having such a heart means that we want God, God&rsquo;s truth, and God&rsquo;s word. Every time we listen to a message, we must prepare our heart, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I desire to seek You, and I want to seek Your truth and Your word. I open my heart to Your truth and Your word.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Matter of the Mind</h2>
<p>The second aspect is related to our mind. Merely having a heart without using our mind is not enough. In the matter of contacting the Lord&rsquo;s word, some people have a lack related to both their heart and mind. Such ones will not gain much benefit. Others have a heart, but their mind is not focused. Such ones will also not be able to gain much benefit. For a person to have an unfocused mind means that his mind is not calm and that his thoughts are scattered. Such a person is troubled inwardly, being full of anxieties and worries about many matters. He is unable to be disentangled from the things that are apart from the Lord. It is very difficult for such a person to listen to or read God&rsquo;s word. Therefore, we must be prepared in our mind. We need to ask the Lord to cause our mind to be disentangled from the things that are apart from Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> </body></html>
