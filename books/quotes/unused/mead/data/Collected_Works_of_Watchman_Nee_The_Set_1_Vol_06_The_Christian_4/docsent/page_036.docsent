   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Second Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Persecuting Christians</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us read a passage from the Bible that was spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For you build up the graves of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say, If we had been there in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So then you testify against yourselves that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And you, fill up the measure of your fathers!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Serpents!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brood of vipers!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How shall you escape the judgment of Gehenna?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, behold, I send to you prophets and wise men and scribes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth" Matt 23:29-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this portion of the Word, the Lord Jesus tells us clearly that those who persecute Christians cannot avoid the punishment of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You, who are Christians listening to this word, should not be happy, thinking that all those who persecute you will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You need to know what it means to be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suffering persecution means suffering people's opposition and oppression because of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your practice of righteousness and preaching of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the true meaning of persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you suffer people's opposition because of your misconduct, then you are suffering punishment, not persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Please be careful; do not confuse punishment with persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Punishment occurs because of your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Persecution occurs because of your faith in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you are opposed by people because you believe in the Lord, you have glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If people oppose you because of a defect in your conduct, then do not consider that you are being persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is more fitting to say that you are being punished.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there are unbelievers here, please be considerate and do not persecute Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you persecute them because of their bad conduct, no one can say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if you persecute or kill them because they believe in the Lord Jesus, and their conduct is not below the normal moral standard, then beware, because their God is the Lord of all who will punish sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this portion of the Scripture, the Lord Jesus tells us clearly that the end for these people is hell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us think about this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Should those who genuinely believe in the Lord Jesus be persecuted?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They read the Bible every day in order to use the Bible to cultivate their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They pray every day for those in authority and for all people, hoping that God will save them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They often go out and preach, exhorting people to rid themselves of their sins, thereby removing not only the sins resulting from the violation of the laws of the country, but also the sins resulting from the violation of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They desire that people would know the true God and believe in the Lord Jesus as their Savior and receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Should these people be persecuted?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Is it reasonable to persecute such people?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may say that Christians are superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But among four hundred million Chinese, are they the only ones who are superstitious?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps they are persecuted because they frequently say that man is sinful and should rid himself of his sins, repent, and believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But is there any harm in this preaching?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Or do you hate them because you are a sinner and they expose your sins?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you are a thoughtful person and know that you have sinned, you should quickly repent and believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is reasonable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Why do you persecute them because you are angry at your embarrassment?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many Christians often see people dying without Christ, crying out at the time of their departure from this world, in fear of the coming darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These people do not want to die because they are not ready to face death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Under these circumstances and according to the Bible, many Christians can tell these dying persons that, if they are willing to receive the Lord as their Savior and depend upon the Lord's merit completely, they can receive eternal life immediately because Jesus Christ has borne their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>No one knows how many dying sinners have been comforted and saved by this kind of promise and gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let me ask you, should those who help a dying sinner's conscience obtain peace be persecuted?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, physically speaking, the church has done many outward works.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Like yourselves, I am also against this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But there are many genuine Christians who really love the Lord and other people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No one knows how much they have secretly done to help ordinary people.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They never sound the trumpet before men to announce their good deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Do you think that people who do charitable works without any motive for fame or profit should be persecuted?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Concerning the good works of real Christians, we can say much more, but I think that this is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After all, who has set you up to be a judge so that you can persecute others?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who persecute others say that Christian morality is degraded and hypocritical; that parochial schools represent a cultural invasion; that some churches' charitable institutions bribe people's hearts; that the strategy of the churches' preaching and spiritual works is to keep people in ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I will not argue with you either about the deeds and motives of Christians or whether or not your statements are true.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But let me just ask one question.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you say that the morality of others is degraded, is your morality not degraded?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you say that others are hypocritical, are you without a mask?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are you really better than Christians in all of your deeds and conduct?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have to be qualified before you can persecute Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Unless you are better than the Christians, unless you are not guilty of committing the sins that you condemn Christians of having committed, then you are not qualified to persecute Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You should persecute yourself first.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After all, the persecution of Christians did not just begin today, but it started a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is greatly blessed because it has received much help from its opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even Paul, the greatest apostle of the church, was one of the greatest persecutors of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although you may say that you are my enemy today, I do not believe this word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I really hope that one day you and I will preach the gospel together.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Speaking of myself, I also greatly opposed Christianity in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But today I am a Christian because I have received the salvation of the Lord Jesus who has forgiven my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Now I have immeasurable joy and unspeakable peace.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I really hope that you will receive the Savior and serve Him with me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It is very worthwhile to believe in Him and serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You can clearly know that your sins have been forgiven, and then your conscience can no longer accuse you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Presently, you can work to save other people's souls; and in the future you will enjoy the blessings of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Why should you persecute Christians?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Please come to believe in the Lord Jesus and be persecuted by others instead!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>During the age of the church's persecution, ten believers who refused to deny their faith were escorted by a group of soldiers to the top of a high mountain so that they would suffer unbearable cold and be forced to renounce their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But the ten believers, who were naked in the severe cold, sang loudly together, "Ten Christian soldiers are willing to suffer for the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Since they could not bear the penetrating cold, their voices became weaker and weaker.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Due to the cold, one believer left the place where they were testifying for the Lord and ran to be with the soldiers sitting around a fire and tried to get warm.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This was his testimony that he had renounced his faith.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But at that moment, one of the soldiers took off all his clothes and gave them to the unfaithful Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then he ran to the nine believers, stood with them, and sang loudly, "Ten Christian soldiers..." until he died.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He became a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Please be considerate.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>You do not know when you may also become a Christian, perhaps in a few months, a few years, or just a few hours.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>No one can tell.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You cannot guarantee that you will not become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>So why should you persecute them today?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If you persecute Christians, you persecute Christ because Christ and Christians are united into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When you persecute Christians, you are declaring that you do not believe in Christ as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If you do not believe in Him as your Savior, then you do not have a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>If you do not have a Savior, then you should bear your own sins.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In other words, you will perish and go to hell because you do not have a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Why should you go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Please accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior today!</S>
