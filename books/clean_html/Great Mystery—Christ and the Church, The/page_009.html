<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING ALL IN THE NEW MAN</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will continue to consider Christ as the mystery of God. In the book of Colossians the apostle Paul unveils the mysterious Christ. Paul also reveals how to experience such a Christ. Seeing is the beginning of experience. Hence, after we see the vision of Christ, we need to experience Him. Therefore, Colossians concerns not only revelation and vision but also experience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLE BRINGING ALL THINGS TO NAUGHT<br />
AND BEING FOR CHRIST</h2>
<p>Concerning the experience of Christ, there are two sides: the side of the apostle and the side of the saints. The apostle Paul labored and even struggled to remove the veils so that he could present a vision of Christ (1:29). The word <em>labor</em> does not denote light work; it refers to a great deal of effort and hard work. Paul&rsquo;s labor included struggling. The word <em>struggling</em> implies fighting, warfare, and contending. Paul not only labored but also fought and contended, because there were enemies and forces opposing Christ. In his time everything&mdash;including race, politics, religion, and culture&mdash;opposed the Christ whom Paul preached. Judaism and Greek philosophy were obstacles to Paul, and the cultural atmosphere, political conflicts, and nationalistic ideology of the nations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea were also obstacles in Paul&rsquo;s path, hindering him. Therefore, he labored and struggled.</p>
<p>There were many nations surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. On the east were the Jews in the Holy Land, to the west was the Roman Empire, in the north were barbarians, and to the south was Egypt. Paul fought against Greek culture, Jewish religion, Roman politics, and barbaric forces. He wanted to bring the will of God to the earth and impart it into man, but all these peoples were opposing him. Jewish religion, Greek philosophy, Roman politics, nationalistic ideologies, and customs of the nations opposed him. Apparently, they were opposing Paul, but in reality they were opposing Christ. Religion, philosophy, politics, culture, and barbarianism are opposed to Christ. Everything is opposed to Christ. Peter was the pioneer in this struggle and fight, but he later became weak and shrank back into Judaism (Gal. 2:12). When Paul wrote the book of Colossians, he seemed to be the only one struggling and fighting to unveil Christ.</p>
<p> Concerning the new man&mdash;the church as the product of the saints&rsquo; experience of Christ&mdash;Paul says, &ldquo;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all&rdquo; (3:11). The saints in Hong Kong might dislike me if I were to tell them that there cannot be Cantonese in the church. If I were to tell the saints in Chefoo that there cannot be Shantungese in the church, they might accuse me of forgetting my roots. This, however, is what Paul preached. When he said that there cannot be Greek, the Jews might have clapped their hands and cheered. But when he said that there cannot be Jews, the Jews might have accused him of forgetting his roots. When Paul said that there cannot be circumcision, the Gentiles might have clapped their hands. However, Paul also said that there cannot be uncircumcision. In other words, there can be neither religion nor non-religion, because both religion and non-religion are of no value. Paul put down everything.</p>
<p>Paul also said that there cannot be barbarian or Scythian. Some people think that <em>Scythians</em> refers to people who were very cultured. However, according to the most reliable sources of history, the Scythians were the most barbarous people, and they lived in Europe. Paul negated Greek and Jew, religious and non-religious, cultured and barbarian, and also slave and free man. He negated everyone except Christ, because in the new man there is only Christ.</p>
<p>The purpose of Paul&rsquo;s labor was to minister Christ to people. For this reason, Paul was given a stewardship; God entrusted him with the treasures of His house and the key to His warehouse. Paul opened this warehouse and ministered the riches in the warehouse, that is, ministered Christ, to the Jews, Greeks, Romans, and all the people surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. Christ is opposed to all things. In the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew, religion or non-religion, cultured or barbarian, slave or free man, rich or poor. There cannot be anything other than Christ. Hence, Paul stirred up opposition when he presented Christ. Paul did not try to offend people; as long as he ministered Christ, he was opposed, because Christ was not welcomed. Whether people are cultured or barbarous, rich or poor, religious or non-religious, they are opposed to Christ. Therefore, problems arose whenever Paul presented Christ. This is why Paul labored, fought, and struggled in his work. Christ could be imparted into many because Paul struggled in such a way.</p>
