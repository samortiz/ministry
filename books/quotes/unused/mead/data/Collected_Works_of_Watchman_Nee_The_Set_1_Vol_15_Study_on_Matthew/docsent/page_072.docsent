   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 21:"Jesus said to him, If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This young man's attitude was most vigorous; he thought that there was not one good thing he could not do.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Therefore, the Lord pointed out one good thing that he was unable to do to sell all and give to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"If you want to be perfect."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows that even if one could keep all the Ten Commandments, he would still not be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Go, sell your possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The young man was not opposed to selling because he could still keep the money.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"And give to the poor."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"And come, follow Me."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means to wander without a place for rest; this is even more impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 22:"But the young man, hearing this word, went away sorrowing, for he had many possessions."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Went away sorrowing."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This proves that the young man could not do good.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He could not even keep the Ten Commandments; he could not give to the poor and could not love his neighbor as himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God gave the law originally, knowing that man could never keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He desired only that after man had committed sin, he would know that he himself is a sinner Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The young man would rather forsake eternal life to gain worldly pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, he was a perishing one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 23:"And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, Only with difficulty will a rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"And Jesus said to His disciples."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here the Lord turned to another problem the reward of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The seed of this parable was sown in verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Seemingly, this parable is difficult to understand because eternal life, the kingdom of the heavens, the kingdom of God, and salvation are all mixed together.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually, it is not difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One must distinguish two clear lines: 1 the young man was pursuing eternal life; and 2 the Lord used the incident of the young man as a teaching through which to explain to the disciples clearly the reward of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 21 was the word of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord assumed that the young man was saved; hence, He used the word of the kingdom to point this out to him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To lay up treasure in heaven refers to the riches in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"A rich man enter into the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This word was for the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord assumed that this young man was a saved person.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That is why this parable is so difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 24:"And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The eye of a needle has been referred to as the gate of a city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is inaccurate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A camel was an animal used to carry the heavy burden and treasures of a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not that a rich man cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose the rich man forsakes his treasures when the Lord demands this of him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Certainly he can enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, it does not say that it is impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here the definition of a rich man is a person who is unwilling to commit to God that which he loves.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a rich man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, it is possible to be a rich man with only five or ten dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"The kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the previous verse the kingdom of the heavens is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here it says "the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are three meanings of the kingdom of the heavens: 1 the realm of Christianity, 2 the church, and 3 the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There are also three meanings of the kingdom of God: 1 spiritual experiences Luke 14:15 , 2 the millennium, and 3 eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The kingdom of the heavens in verse 23 refers to the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But to avoid misunderstanding, verse 24 calls it the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The only thing common between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens is the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that the kingdom of God in verse 24 has a specific meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Verse 25:"And when the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and said, Who then can be saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Greatly astonished."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The disciples misunderstood because the Lord turned from the question of eternal life to the question of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is impossible for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, they assumed that no one could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That was why they inquired of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verse 26:"And looking upon them, Jesus said to them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"And looking upon them."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The eyes could speak.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"With God all things are possible."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Again, the question of the disciples turned the subject back to the matter of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Salvation depends on God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God can change the greediness of man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God can raise up Paul, Barnabas, Levi, Ceasar's household Phil 4:22 , and the steward of Herod Luke 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The young man spoke as if he were able.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Actually, he was not; only God is able.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 27:"Then Peter answered and said to Him, Behold, we have left all and followed You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What then will there be for us?"</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Peter's question actually exposed 1 his self-righteousness, and 2 his commercial mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord had two impressions concerning this question: 1 He agreed with Peter that the reward of the kingdom did actually depend on works, and 2 He disagreed with Peter's self-righteousness and his commercial mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In verses 28-30 the Lord encouraged and confirmed Peter's knowledge of the kingdom reward Matt 20:1-16 ; then He rebuked him for his commercial mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Verse 28:"And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>"You who have followed me."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This refers to those who learn of the Lord, who walk on the narrow way, who bear the cross, and who are patient and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"In the restoration."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This word is used twice in the Bible, here and in Titus 3:5.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the latter case it refers to personal revival, which is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Here it refers to the restoration of the world, which is the millennium Rom 8:19-23; Isa 11:6-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>From Adam to Moses sin was in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>From Moses to the Lord Jesus sin ruled.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In this age the regenerated ones are delivered only from the power of sin; they are not delivered from the presence of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The same is true of the restoration of the world; first, there is the deliverance from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Satan will be bound for one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This means that in the millennium the Lord will improve society, but this will not be done through man.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>After this, there will be the new heaven and the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>"Twelve thrones."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Of course, Judas will not be there.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>That is why the Lord did not mention him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We do not need to find out who will replace him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Verse 29:"And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name's sake shall receive a hundred times as much and shall inherit eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>These are no small words.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Gospel of Mark recorded "at this time" and "in the coming age" Mark 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Matthew does not use these phrases because everything mentioned here concerns the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>"A hundred times" does not mean one hundred fathers, but one hundredfold joy which is many times more than the grief and pain one suffers when forsaking all .</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Eternal life here means eternal life in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There are three stages of eternal life: 1 eternal life in the present age John 5:24 , 2 eternal life in the millennium in the coming age, which means the next age, the millennium Mark 10:30; Luke 18:30 , and 3 eternal life in eternity Rom 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Verse 30: "But many first will be last, and many last first."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This indicates that there is a difference in reward.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Also, it is used as a warning against Peter's self-righteousness.</S>
