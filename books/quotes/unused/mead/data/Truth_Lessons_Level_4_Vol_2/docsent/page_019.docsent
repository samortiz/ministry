   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 5 Balaam said, How fair are your tents, O Jacob, / Your tabernacles, O Israel!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the third parable, Israel is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Israel s beauty is indicated by the word fair.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the first parable Israel is holy, in the second parable she is sinless, and in the third she is beautiful.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This reveals that God has chosen, redeemed, saved, separated, uplifted, perfected, and beautified this people.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This bothered Balak.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 10 says, Then Balak s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And Balak said to Balaam, I called you to curse my enemies, but now you have altogether blessed them these three times.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verses 12 and 13 Balaam said to Balak, Did I not also speak to your messengers whom you sent to me, saying, Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of Jehovah, to do either good or bad from my own heart?</S>
