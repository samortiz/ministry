   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PUNISHMENT IN THE MILLENNIAL KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible says that many children of God will have specific punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many Christians have improper walks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They do not live in a godly way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They love the world and walk according to their will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They worship God according to man's way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They have not obeyed God's Word in taking care of God's work, but have instead done what they themselves like to do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They try to please men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They seek man's glory rather than God's glory and are not willing to stand in the same place of shame that the Lord stood in. They commit many mistakes and many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They have not been disciplined by God in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After they die and are resurrected on that day, can they reign with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible says that we have to suffer and bear reproach with Him first before we can reign and be glorified with Him 2 Tim 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only have many believers never suffered, they have many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They love the world and walk according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When they leave the world, they will still have much unrighteousness and many sins that were not dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible shows us that such believers will have specific and definite chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew 18:23-35 speaks of a slave being forgiven of his debts by the master.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Another slave owed this first one a debt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the slave who was forgiven of his debt would not forgive his fellow slave.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first slave definitely represents a saved person, because he pleaded for the master's forgiveness, and the master, who was moved with compassion, released him and forgave his debt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are all helpless persons coming to the Lord to seek grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord has forgiven our debt and has let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If this one represents a Christian, then whatever this one faces represents what we will face.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The way the master deals with this slave will be the way the Lord deals with us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 28-30 say, "But that slave went out."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He went out because he was now a free man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, and he took hold of him and began to choke him, saying, Repay me what you owe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then his fellow slave fell down and begged him, saying, Be patient with me and I will repay you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But he would not; instead, he went away and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This passage is about one Christian not forgiving the sin of another.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You are a forgiven person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But you are not willing to be forgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord has forgiven you of ten thousand talents.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now your brother owes you a mere one hundred denarii, but you say in your heart that he must repay.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He must repay you even the last cent. What will the result be then? Verses 31-33 continue, "Then his fellow slaves, seeing what had taken place, were greatly grieved and came and explained fully to their master all that had taken place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then his master called him to him and said to him, Evil slave, all that debt I forgave you, because you begged me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave even as I had mercy on you?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That this person represents a saved one is again proved by the fact that the Lord had mercy on him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord said, Should you not have mercy on your fellow slave as I have had mercy on you?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Should you not forgive your fellow slave as I have forgiven you?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This proves that this one represents one who has received God's mercy and forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He must be one that has life already.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But he will not forgive other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"And his master became angry and delivered him to the torturers until he would repay all that was owed" v. 34 . This one, who had been shown mercy and who had been forgiven, was put back into the hand of the torturers until he repaid all that was owed to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether he could repay all that he owed is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The fact is, he would have to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This shows us that if a Christian will not forgive another, on that day the Lord will deal with him in the same way that he has dealt with others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you would not forgive your brother, the Lord will deal with you according to your unforgiving attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>MERCY AND JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We know that our God is a righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the future, at the judgment seat, He will judge us according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, though there is righteousness at the judgment seat, there is mercy also.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you show mercy to others, the Lord will be merciful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you are unforgiving toward others, and if you are so righteous and unyielding toward others' failures and weaknesses, the Lord will deal with you in righteousness in that day.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you are merciful to others, the Lord will show mercy to you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Luke 6:37 says that if you do not pass sentence on others, sentence will not be passed on you; if you will not judge others, you will not be judged, and if you forgive others, you will be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some Christians are too mean today.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When they criticize others they scrutinize every mistake others make.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When they do their best to criticize and judge others, they have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the future God will deal with them in the same way they deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With what measure you measure to others, it will be measured to you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you give to others good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over, the Lord will give to you in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He who forgives will be forgiven, and to him who shows mercy, mercy will be shown.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Hence, the Bible says that mercy triumphs over judgment James 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There is one thing which even judgment cannot triumph over a person showing mercy to others throughout his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We cannot be without mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But if we show mercy to others today, God will be unable to deal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many Christians are not able to lose in their dealings with others.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They argue all the time with others.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They give little ground to others and grant themselves all the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But we should rather show mercy to others today.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When the time of judgment comes, there will be some whom even the Lord of judgment will not be able to hold anything against.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This does not mean that man can purposely change God's commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It simply means that if you are merciful to others while you are living on earth, God will be merciful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Your mercy today will triumph over your judgment tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The way you judge others will be the way that you will be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This grace is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The way you treat others will be the way that the Lord will treat you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The way you treat others will fashion for you a vessel, with which God will measure out judgment to you.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>James 2:13 says, "For the judgment is without mercy to him who has shown no mercy; mercy triumphs over judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Those who show no mercy to others will be judged without mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But those who show mercy to others will triumph over judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Your mercy will surpass the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is an amazing fact.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Matthew 18 shows us clearly that God's children can still fall into the hand of the torturers.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If they do, they will have to remain there until they pay off all their debts.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Of course, there is no way to pay off all the debts.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But at least one day they will learn to be merciful and to forgive others in the same way that the Lord showed mercy to them and forgave them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>By then they will still have to show mercy to others.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Hence, in verse 35 the Lord says, "So also will My heavenly Father do to you if each of you does not forgive his brother from your hearts."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This portion of the Word is not spoken to unbelievers, but to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It shows the relationship between the heavenly Father and His children and the relationship between the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Prior to this portion of the Word, Peter asked the Lord, "How often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Up to seven times?"</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Matt 18:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The Lord told him that he should forgive up to seventy times seven.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Then the Lord spoke the word about the two slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Peter will face chastisement if he does not forgive his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The word of the Lord shows Peter that there is the possibility that he could be thrown to the torturers.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>There is the possibility that he could be put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If there is the possibility for Peter to be thrown to the torturers and cast into prison, there is the possibility for us to be treated the same way also.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>That is why the Lord used the plural "you" in verse 35.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>His word is not for Peter only; it is for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>If we do not forgive each one of our brothers from our heart, the heavenly Father will do the same to us.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Please remember that our eternal salvation in the new heaven and new earth is unshakable.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Thank the Lord that this is by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>But if our problems today are not dealt with specifically, we will still suffer specific punishment in the future kingdom.</S>
