   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GROWTH IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why did the Apostle Paul write 1 Corinthians 3 as he did?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why did he say that he planted, Apollos watered, and God gave the growth?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why did he say that, as a wise masterbuilder, grace was given to him, that he laid the foundation, and that another builds thereon with either gold, silver, and precious stones, or wood, hay and stubble?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to consider the entire book to understand why he wrote in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In 1 Corinthians 1:5 and 7, Paul told the Corinthians that they had all knowledge and lacked no gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But then he said in 3:1 that he could not speak to them as to spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He told them that they were still carnal, fleshly babes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why we say that Bible knowledge and gifts in themselves do not help.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Corinthians had both, but were very short in growth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the local churches we are not sectarian or exclusive; we receive every proper thing that is of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not opposed to Bible knowledge; neither are we opposed to the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the Lord's recovery today is not a matter of knowledge or gifts it is a matter of growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the past one hundred fifty years the doctrines and gifts have been recovered but the growth in life has not been recovered adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our burden today is for the recovery of the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is good that you have Bible knowledge and that you have spoken in tongues, but do not stop with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Go on to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is such a danger that those who have Bible knowledge will stop there, and that those who have experienced gifts will stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You must go on.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Knowledge may be a bridge to bring you from one side to the other, but do not stay on that bridge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need to go on to life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE BASIC STRUCTURES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The book of Matthew does not emphasize Bible knowledge or gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, it stresses the seed of life and the growth of that seed with transformation to produce minerals for the building up of the church Matt 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord told Peter that he was a stone, and that He would build His church and give to Peter the keys of the kingdom Matt 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are some of the basic items found in the book of Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seven parables in Matthew, the mysteries of the kingdom, are also basic items.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, healing and tongues are not basic structures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The basic structures are the seed, growth, transformation, and building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am not against Bible knowledge or gifts, but I am against overemphasizing them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some who speak in tongues care for nothing but tongues-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is not a tongues-speaking church, and the Lord's recovery is not the recovery of tongues-speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although tongues-speaking may have helped people, it is not basic.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The basic items are the seed, the growth, the transformation, and the building.</S>
