   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This lesson book covers the subject of God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What does God s full salvation mean?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why do we need to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From what and into what are we saved?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why does God want to save us and why can He alone save us?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How does He save us and what do we have to do to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a long list of questions to consider.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This book will answer all these questions and tell you more about God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this first lesson we want to cover something that you might never have heard before, something that happened in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. GOD S PLAN IN ETERNITY PAST</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The book of Ephesians tells us that before God created anything, when He was all alone, He had a good pleasure, a heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to this good pleasure, He made a plan, a will.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible calls this the purpose of the ages, or the eternal purpose Eph 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God also made an arrangement or a way by which He could fulfill this eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible calls this arrangement God s economy or God s dispensation 1 Tim 1:4; Eph 1:10; 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So, the Bible reveals to us that in eternity past God had an eternal purpose according to His good pleasure and an economy or a means to fulfill that purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GOD S GOOD PLEASURE</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is God s good pleasure?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is simply what pleases Him and makes Him happy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All that God has done has been according to this good pleasure, just as you and I do things according to what pleases us and makes us happy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>GOD S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is God s eternal purpose which is according to His good pleasure?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s eternal purpose is to have a group of people, a corporate man, created in His image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God desires this man to be filled with Him as life in order to express Him and have His dominion to represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is God s eternal purpose because it was planned by God before time began and will never change.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And what is God s economy or His way to fulfill this purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s way to gain such a corporate man is by dispensing Himself into man as life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without dispensing Himself into man, His purpose can never be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>V. GOD S ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But, before He could do so, Satan, God s enemy, came in to deceive man and to inject his own sinful life and nature into man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Through this, man fell into a pitiful condition, full of sinful acts and a sinful nature which ruined him for God s great purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GOD S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God, however, cannot be defeated!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Though man fell and God s plan was frustrated, God still loved man and would not be moved from His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>So, God took action to save man in order to accomplish His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This action is His full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Questions What is God s good pleasure ?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Give an illustration from your own life to explain what the Bible means by God s good pleasure, His purpose, and His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What is God s eternal purpose?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Define the word eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Why do we say that God s purpose is eternal?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Define the word economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is God s economy?</S>
