   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HUMAN VIRTUES OF JESUS EXPRESSING THE DIVINE ATTRIBUTES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to see that the death of Christ has not only a negative aspect but also a positive aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The positive aspect was to release Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That the Lord Jesus was God was concealed for thirty-three and a half years in His flesh, in His human form.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In His life on earth of thirty-three and a half years, a great part of His living was the manifestation of His inner divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What was manifested became His human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, the common readers of the Scriptures see only that Jesus was very good and full of virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But very few people see what the essence of the virtues of the Lord Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The essence of the virtues of the Lord Jesus is the divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The divine attributes refer to what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is light and love, and God is also patience, holiness, and meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All that God is, is His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these attributes are inherent in God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then what is God?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is light, love, righteousness, holiness, and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we add all these attributes together, what we have is God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the law written by God was also written according to His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus lived on this earth, He lived a human life, yet what He lived out was not something human but something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that the divine attributes were lived out of Him to become the virtues of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today, in general, preachers speak only about the virtues of Jesus and do not realize that the virtues of Jesus came out of the intrinsic divine attributes that were in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that He lived as a man, yet He lived out God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, when He was on the earth, the people around Him, even His followers, such as Peter, James, and John, often asked, "Who is this One?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Matt 8:27; 13:53-56; Mark 4:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They did not know who He was because they did not realize that Christ was God who became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not to mention that today's Christians do not have this realization; even the disciples who followed the Lord Jesus for three and a half years did not have such a realization.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They said, "Who is this One?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is clearly a man; He is someone whom we all know; His mother is Mary, and we also know His brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, according to what is recorded in the Scriptures, the outward form of Jesus was not tall and husky, and His appearance was not comely; rather, He looked poor and lowly Isa 53:2; 52:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These days I have enjoyed singing a very shallow hymn, #1060.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first stanza with the chorus says, "Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,/When Thou camest to earth for me;/But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room/For Thy holy nativity:/Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!/There is room in my heart for Thee;/Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,/There is room in my heart for Thee."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>My emphasis is on stanza two: "Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,/Proclaiming Thy royal degree;/But of lowly birth cam'st Thou, Lord, on earth,/And in great humility."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What I want to stress is the last two lines: "But of lowly birth cam'st Thou, Lord, on earth,/And in great humility."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Note: In the Chinese version these two lines say: But You came to earth, born of a poor family, without an attractive form,/Grew up in a humble city, and were esteemed by none Trans.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I really like these two lines; they are superb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus was just such a man so that no one would ever think that there was something as a treasure in Him or that God was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter, John, James, Mary, and many others saw the virtues of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He endured what others could not.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regardless of how others insulted Him, He was still meek toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One time He and His disciples passed through a village, but the people of the entire village did not receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So James and John said to the Lord, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But the Lord Jesus said, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" Luke 9:54-55 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>That was a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On another occasion, little children were brought to Jesus so that He might lay His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But Jesus said, "Allow the little children and do not prevent them from coming to Me" Matt 19:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This also was a virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although they saw the virtues of the Lord Jesus, no one realized that these virtues of His were lived out by Him from all the attributes of divinity in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, in this year's Chinese-speaking conference, the new hymn that I wrote says, "Flesh He became, the first God-man,/His pleasure that I God may be:/In life and nature I'm God's kind,/Though Godhead's His exclusively./His attributes my virtues are;/His glorious image shines through me."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the kind of person the Lord Jesus was when He was on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's attributes became the virtues in Jesus, and God's glorious image was manifested and lived out in Him.</S>
