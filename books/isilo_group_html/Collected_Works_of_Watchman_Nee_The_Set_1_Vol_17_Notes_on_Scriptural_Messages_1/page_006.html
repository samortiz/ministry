But now we have a problem. As believers, we are like newborn babes. Sometimes we are well, and sometimes we are not well. Sometimes we rise, and sometimes we fall. What is the reason for this? Does it mean that salvation is not complete? No, it is simply that we have only done the first half-the striking of the blood. There is still a second half, which we have not followed through with immediately. The result is that we still become weak and fail. This second half of the work should be done once the blood has been applied. Now let us consider this second half of the work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. EATING THE FLESH OF THE LAMB THE SAME NIGHT<br>(EXODUS 12:8)</H2><P>"In that night" means on the night the blood was struck. After the blood is struck, one should go on to eat the flesh of the lamb. The blood was struck on the lintel and the side posts; this is outward. The eating is to take care of the inward need. The blood of the Lord is objective, while the eating of the flesh is subjective. The striking of the blood is for God to see, while the eating of the flesh is for the nourishment of one's own body. Because the blood has been struck, God passes over us. At the same time, God has given the Lord Jesus to us to eat. In this way we are strengthened.</P><P>Salvation, on the one hand, satisfies God, and on the other hand, changes us. Striking the blood satisfies God, while eating the flesh changes us. The blood has been struck, but I have to ask whether you have eaten the flesh yet. What is the meaning of the flesh being in the stomach? It means that it has been digested and has become you; it has become your flesh and your bone. If you have only struck the blood outside, but have not eaten the flesh of the lamb, you will not see much change in your life, and you will remain too weak and powerless to be a victorious believer. You must eat the flesh of the lamb the same night that you strike the blood.</P><P>Today there is one mistake which men make in preaching the gospel. They preach only one side of the story. Christ's work is of two sides. On the one hand, He works outside of us so that God may be pleased with us. On the other hand, He works inside of us so that we may be satisfied in life. Today men pay attention only to Christ's dying for them and neglect His being life to them. We exhort men only to believe that His blood was shed for them; we seldom exhort men to receive Him into their heart to be their inward Savior and deliver them from all the inward sins and weaknesses. Hence, our result reflects our preaching-we gain many believers who are correct in their faith but who are weak in life and who are fluctuating all the time.</P><P>The people had to eat the flesh of the lamb, for the next day they had to move and make their journey. How long a journey did they have to make? They had to make the long journey from Egypt to Canaan. Today we have to be well fed before we can have the strength to make our journey. Why is it that many people are not making the wilderness journey? It is because they have not yet been fed.</P><P>Striking the blood is for God's satisfaction. However, if you do not eat the flesh of the lamb, you will not have satisfaction because you have not yet received Christ as your life. Since you have received Jesus as your Savior, you also have to receive Him as Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VIII. THE WAY TO EAT THE LAMB<br>(EXODUS 12:8-10)</H2><P>"And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire."</P><P>"Roast with fire." Fire signifies the Holy Spirit or God's love. The flesh must be roasted with fire. This means that we cannot use our natural strength to receive Christ as our life; neither can we use any human methods. We have to receive Christ as our life through the Holy Spirit. John 6:51 says, "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever; and the bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world." Verse 63 says, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life." We should pay attention to the fact that John 6:51-59 is on the bread of life; it is on the question of life. After the disciples heard these words, they could not understand. Some thought about giving up their discipleship. For this reason the Lord told them that "the flesh profits nothing."</P><P>It is true that we need to eat, but what is the way to eat? The disciples were trying to eat the flesh raw. Hence, the Lord told them that they have to roast it with fire. Fire is the Spirit in John 6:63. When we receive Him as Savior, we have eternal life, but we must also receive Him as Lord before we can have eternal victory.</P><P>"And unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it." Leaven refers to sin. To be unleavened is to remove all sins. Every person who has received Jesus as his Savior, according to the Bible, has to eat the flesh the same night. Some of us are abnormal and subnormal Christians because although we are saved, we wait a long time before we receive Him as our Lord! However, the Bible says that the night the blood was struck, they ate the flesh of the lamb. In other words, the same night that the blood was struck they removed sin.</P><P>Christ gives to us two gifts. One is justification, and the other is sanctification. We may only want to have one of them, but Christ will not give us one only. If we do not remove our sins, we cannot obtain God's forgiveness. If we do not hate our sins and desire holiness, Christ cannot justify us. We must strike the blood and also eat the flesh. But at the same time, we must have the unleavened bread; we must hate sin. If any man eats the flesh with leavened bread, this man has not applied the blood yet; he is still unsaved. It is true that a Christian can afterward sin or crave sin, but if he has never once hated sin since the day he believed in Jesus as his Savior, he must not be saved yet.</P><P>The "bitter herbs," according to the original language, do not refer to any herbs in particular; they merely refer to any herbs that are bitter. The bitter herbs imply a contrite heart. If a person wants to be saved yet does not hate sin, he cannot eat the flesh, for he does not have a contrite heart. Second Corinthians 7:10-11 says, "For sorrow according to God works repentance unto salvation, which is without regret...For behold this very thing, your being made sorrowful according to God, what earnestness it has worked out in you, indeed what defense, indeed what indignation, indeed what fear, indeed what longing, indeed what zeal, indeed what punishment! In everything you have commended yourselves to be pure in the matter." These are the bitter herbs. The bitter herbs mean that one rebukes and hates himself. God will not despise a contrite and repentant heart.</P><P>"Eat not of it raw." To eat it raw means to eat according to natural strength. One must not eat the flesh of the lamb raw, which means that it is futile to hold onto Christ with natural strength.</P><P>"Nor sodden at all with water." To be sodden with water is to use human methods. The flesh of the lamb cannot be sodden with water. This means that it is futile to hold onto Christ with human methods.</P><P>"And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire." This means that by the next morning one can no longer eat it even if he wished to. What is the meaning of morning? Morning is the time of resurrection; it is the time when one truly leaves Egypt, the time of rapture from Egypt. Hence, to eat the flesh of the lamb, one must do so before the morning. After that, if anyone wanted to eat the flesh of the Lamb and receive Jesus as his Lord and his life, it would be too late.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 17: Notes on Scriptural Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
