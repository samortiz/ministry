The result of God's salvation is to join men to Christ. If a man is not joined to Christ, salvation counts for nothing, and the Christian life means nothing. Redemption has its basis in Christ's union with man. The most important concept in the Bible is that of union. This union has nothing to do with understanding some doctrines; it has to do with the revelation of the reality of our union with Christ. If a Christian sees this, he will spontaneously become a living person. If he does not see this, he is dead and has no involvement with Christ in life.</p><h2 class="head1">IN ADAM</h2><p>The matter of union is revealed throughout the whole Bible. In Genesis Adam and Eve sinned. The Bible says that all have sinned through one man. It does not matter how we have conducted ourselves. When Adam sinned, all of his descendants sinned as well. The veil to the Holy of Holies was embroidered with four living creatures. These four living creatures signify the whole creation, while the veil signifies the body of Christ (Heb. 10:20). This tells us that the whole creation was joined to Christ. When His body was broken (Matt. 27:51; Heb. 10:20), the whole creation went through God's judgment. He accomplished redemption for the whole creation (Heb. 2:9). Leviticus tells us that the offerer had to lay his hand on the offering before it was offered up as a sacrifice. This was a sign of the union of the offering with the offerer. In Joshua 4 the Israelites took twelve stones from the river Jordan when they crossed over. We find reference to the matter of union everywhere in the Bible. Union is a very basic principle. In the New Testament, 1 Corinthians 15 speaks of the first man and the second man. The first man is Adam, and the second man is Christ. The second man is the last man; after Him, there is no third man. This is a fact in the eyes of God. In His eyes there are only two men&mdash;Adam and Christ. A person is either in Christ or in Adam.</p><p>Consider the insects. One little insect soon propagates itself into dozens of insects. They are identical to the one. If we do not kill the one little insect at the beginning, it will propagate itself into a big colony. Adam was the first "insect." Those who came after him are the descendants of Adam; they are the same as he. When a man is born, his parents give him a name, which is his given name. His family name never changes. His family name is the same as that of his ancestors. Everyone derives his heritage from his ancestors; everyone inherits his life from his ancestors. All the descendants of Adam have inherited the Adamic life of sin.</p><h2 class="head1">IN CHRIST</h2><p>Since every descendant of Adam has inherited his sinful life, what must God do to save man? He does not save us individually one by one. He does not deal with us as individuals. Rather, He has put us all into Christ. All He had to do was to deal with Christ. God caused Christ to bear our sins, die for us, and resurrect for us. In dealing with Christ, God dealt with us all. There is a pregnant sister from Changchow who once lived in Kulangsu. Later, her child was born in Changchow. Has the baby ever been to Kulangsu? Of course he has. He was in Kulangsu when he was in his mother's womb. Adam and Christ are both originators; we are in either one or the other. Before we were saved, we were in Adam. All of Adam's experiences were our experiences. After we are saved, we were put into Christ. All of Christ's accomplishments have become our experiences. This is the way God deals with us.</p><h2 class="head1">OF GOD WE ARE IN CHRIST</h2><p>Some may ask, "How can we be in Christ? He was crucified two thousand years ago. At that time I was not even born. How can I be in Christ and be crucified with Him?" We can consider the following illustration. When I was a child, my aunt once gave me a ten-dollar bill, and I put it into the pocket of my long gown. When I sent the gown to the cleaner, I forgot to take the money out. By the time I discovered it, the money was ruined from being washed. The one who washed the gown did not have any intention to wash my money, but it was washed when the gown was washed because it was inside the gown. Consider this hymnbook. Suppose I slip a piece of paper into this hymnbook and mail it to Nanking. Where will the piece of paper be? Is it possible for the book to go to Nanking and for the paper to remain here? No. Although I am sending the hymnbook to Nanking, the paper will arrive when the book arrives, because the paper is inside the book. If I throw the hymnbook into the river, the paper will be thrown into the river as well. If I snatch the book out of the water, the paper will be snatched out of the water also. The experience of the hymnbook will be the experience of the paper, because the paper is in the book. If I, Watchman Nee, can put a piece of paper into a book, is God not able to put all of us into Christ? This is something very easy for Him to do. He has put us all into Christ (1 Cor. 1:30). Hence, whatever God has done in Christ has been done in us. When Christ was judged by God, we were all judged as well. When Christ died, we died as well. All the experiences of Christ have become our experiences. This shows us that union is the underlying principle of redemption. Our redemption is based on our union with Christ. We receive all the benefits of salvation by being in Christ and joined to Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 45: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (5) &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
