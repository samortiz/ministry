<P>All of us need to be clear about the significance of the compound ointment as a type of the compound Spirit. In order to have a clear revelation of the Spirit, we must be clear about this type. This is similar to our vision of the human government on earth. In order to see the situation of human government on earth from the divine viewpoint, we must be clear about the significance of the great human image in Daniel 2. If we do not understand the significances of that human image, we cannot understand human government in the biblical sense. In Exodus 30 there is a type of the compound Spirit. This is a particular, unique type. This type is beyond our human thought and realization, yet it must be interpreted.</P><P>As children of God, we are obliged to understand the type of the compound ointment. We must understand this type in order to understand the Spirit, just as we must understand that great human image in Daniel 2 in order to understand the prophecy concerning the political government on this earth in God's economy. The significance of the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30 is greater than the creation of the universe. This type shows us that eventually our Triune God, after passing through all the processes, has become this ointment. Our processed and consummated Triune God is this ointment.</P><P>Day after day and moment after moment this ointment is working, moving, acting, and speaking within us. This moving of the ointment, this anointing, teaches us concerning all things. The anointing is the working, moving, acting, and speaking of the ointment, and the ointment is the consummation of our Triune God. We can see now that this type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30 is marvelous.</P><P>What is the Christian life? The Christian life is the acting, moving, working, and speaking of the consummated God who is typified by the compound ointment. In this life, both God and man are applied to us. We are a poor man, a low man, but we have an uplifted man, a man of the divine standard, in this anointing. In this anointing, we also have Christ's death and His death's effectiveness, which is so sweet. We have been forgiven, justified, and reconciled to God through His death so that we could be regenerated to be sons of God. How sweet is the effectiveness of His death as typified by the cinnamon!</P><P>Then in this anointing, we have Christ's resurrection applied to us. Christ's resurrection is so powerful, especially in the sense of resisting and repelling the enemy and all the negative things. This is typified by cassia, which was used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes. Christ's resurrection resists all the opposition and attacks from the enemy, and it repels all the evil "insects" and "snakes." Christ's resurrection is repelling all the demons, evil spirits, and especially their leading one, the snake, the old serpent, the devil.</P><P>The Christian life is not the living out of our natural human virtues. These good things, along with the evil things, belong to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Only the Christian life that is revealed in the Scriptures as the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit belongs to the tree of life. I hope that the fellowship in this message will give us a clear picture of the Christian life.</P>
