Immediately after eating, the fine work of dispensing begins in order to dispense the food into the cells, fibers, and tissues of our being. In the same way, the dispensing of the Triune God is to make the processed and consummated Triune God the very constitution of our being. This fine work of dispensing continues day by day and will be finalized when the sealing ink of the Spirit permeates through our entire body (Eph. 1:13-14). This will be the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23) when we are glorified.</P><P>The dispensing of the Triune God into us causes us to grow with the increase of God (Col. 2:19). For anything to grow it must increase with some element or substance. Human beings grow by the food they take in. If you do not eat anything, you cannot grow. We Christians grow with the increase, the surplus, the addition, of God. God entered into us when we were regenerated. Now He is increasing within us by adding more of Himself to us. However, the amount of God each brother or sister has differs.</P><P>To have the Lord increase within us, we must come to the Word of God to eat each day. The first stanza of Hymns, #811 shows how we must come to the Lord to be fed by Him:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;<br>I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;<br>All that I need is none other but Thee,<br>Thou canst my hunger and thirst satisfy.<br>Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,<br>Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;<br>Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,<br>Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.</P><P>We also must pray in order to be fed by the Lord. Many times, I do not have the time to close my door, kneel down, and pray, but I can say that I often have a spirit of prayer. I have a kind of aspiration within me, and this aspiration causes me to breathe the Lord in very much. It causes me to inhale the living, processed, consummated God into my being.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing for the Divine Economy &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
