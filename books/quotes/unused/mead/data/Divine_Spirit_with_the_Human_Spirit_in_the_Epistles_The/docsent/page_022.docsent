   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RENEWING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The next aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit is that He renews all the parts of our soul our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 23 of chapter 4 says, And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As our inner man is strengthened and the Spirit gains the opportunity to spread into all the parts of our soul, He becomes the renewing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The spirit of your mind is a particular term.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Originally, the Spirit was only in our spirit, but after strengthening our spirit, He spreads into our mind, which is the leading part of the soul and of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this way our mingled spirit becomes the spirit of themind.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Originally, He is the Spirit only in our spirit, but now He becomes the renewing Spirit in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can prove this by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we give Him the ground, the opportunity, to spread into all the parts of our being, we experience the renewing of the Spirit in our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE FILLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 18 of chapter 5 says, Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be drunk is to be filled in the body with wine, but to be filled in spirit is to be filled in our human spirit with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are not persons who are filled with wine; we are persons who are full of the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This divine, spiritual, and heavenly wine is the Spirit, who is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to drink of Him all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are drinkers of the Spirit who are filled with the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Holy Spirit is the filling Spirit, the Spirit who is working to strengthen, renew, and fill us within.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE SLAYING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After we have been strengthened, renewed, and filled within, we are equipped and qualified to do the work of fighting as an army.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We see this aspect in chapter 6.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 17 says, Receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit here is the slaying Spirit as the sword of God to kill the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the foregoing items are in a proper sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians begins with the revealing Spirit, followed by the uniting, building up, strengthening, renewing, and filling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After experiencing the Spirit in all these ways, we are qualified to know Him as the slaying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE PRAYING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 18 continues, By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to slay the enemy, we must pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we do not pray in the spirit, we cannot fight the battle for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the slaying Spirit is the praying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As an introduction to the book of Ephesians, Paul tells us that all the blessings to the church are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then he goes on to say that the Spirit of the Body is the sealing Spirit and the pledge within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The indwelling Spirit within us is the seal to testify that we are God s inheritance, and He is also the earnest, the pledge, to guarantee that God is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After this, Ephesians goes on to show us the different aspects of the work of the indwelling Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First, He reveals the divine things to us, joins us together as one, and builds us up together as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then He does the finer, deeper work of strengthening our spirit to renew our soul and fill our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He also equips and qualifies us for the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He becomes the slaying Spirit within us so that we pray in Him, and He is the praying Spirit to fight the battle for God in order to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to pray concerning all these points in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the revealing Spirit, the uniting Spirit, the building Spirit, the strengthening Spirit, the renewing Spirit, the filling Spirit, the slaying Spirit, and the praying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the revelation of the Spirit of the Body and for the Body.</S>
