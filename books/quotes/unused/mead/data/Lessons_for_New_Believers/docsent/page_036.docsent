   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Toward Ourselves</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ready to Receive Grace, Light, Supply, and Help</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In preparing for a meeting we need to be ready to receive grace, light, supply, and help.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is toward ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before coming to a meeting, we should prepare ourselves to receive grace, light, supply, and help in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Toward the Devil Rejecting Distractions,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hindrances, and a Closed Mouth</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Toward the devil, our preparation is to reject.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We reject distractions, hindrances, and a closed mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The devil has a powerful scheme, which is to keep our mouth closed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He may let us come to a meeting but try to forbid us from opening our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should reject his attempt to keep our mouth closed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some brothers and sisters are kept quiet by the devil because they do not see through his scheme.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From the beginning to the end of a year, they never open their mouths in a meeting; hence, they cannot supply others or be supplied by others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to prepare ourselves before every meeting, saying, I want to open my mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I will not let Satan keep my mouth closed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, cast out the demon of dumbness from me!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Especially the brothers and sisters who are particularly timid and shy should prepare in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 Paul said that the Corinthian believers once served dumb idols, but now they served a God who speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we served dumb idols, we were possessed by a demon of dumbness and were dumb, but now we are serving a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His inspiration reaches us, causing us to open our mouth and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, when we come to a meeting, we should reject Satan s scheme to keep our mouth closed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>LEARNING TO TOUCH</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE FEELING OF THE MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The most important thing in a meeting is to touch the feeling and the atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What are the feeling and atmosphere of a meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, in a wedding meeting everyone is joyful, and we touch a joyful atmosphere as soon as we enter the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a funeral meeting, on the contrary, we sense an atmosphere and feeling of grief.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These two examples clearly show that the atmosphere of a meeting is something concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As long as we have feeling, we should be able to sense the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every meeting has its own feeling and atmosphere, and we need to learn to touch and take care of this atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It would be insensible for us to begin weeping when we enter a wedding meeting or for us to sit in a funeral meeting looking cheerful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should never disregard the feeling and the atmosphere of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although most meetings do not have such a distinct feeling and atmosphere, there is always a feeling and atmosphere in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No meeting is without a feeling or atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, if we want to have a good meeting, we need to learn to touch the feeling and atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order to touch the atmosphere of a meeting, we need to pay attention to the following points.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Touching the Spiritual Facts of the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The feeling of a meeting is a spiritual fact.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we touch this spiritual fact, the feeling of the meeting is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, in order to touch the feeling of a meeting, we need to learn to touch the spiritual facts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In a wedding meeting, for example, everyone is happy because someone is getting married, and there is the fact of happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we touch this fact in a wedding meeting, we are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the feeling of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Another example is a funeral meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a funeral meeting everyone is grieving, and there is the fact of grief.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Touching this fact in a funeral meeting causes us to have a feeling of grief.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the feeling of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The feeling of a meeting is a spiritual fact, and when the spiritual fact touches man s inward feelings, the feeling of the meeting is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must touch the spiritual fact before we can touch the feeling of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Exercising the Sense of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>in Our Daily Living</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to touch the feeling of a meeting, our spiritual sense must be keen.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is difficult for a person with a dull spiritual sense to touch the feeling of a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, a child can run into a wedding meeting crying, even though joy is the fact in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A child can also scream and yell happily in a funeral meeting when everyone is grieving.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is because his inward feelings have not been exercised and are muddled.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In order to touch the fact of a meeting, our inward sense must be keen, not dull.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This keenness depends on our daily exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our spirit is deeper than our mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we normally do everything by our mind, emotion, and will and disregard the feeling in our spirit, the sense of our spirit will not be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Consequently, the sense of our spirit will not be so keen, and it will lose its function when we are in a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, if we exercise the sense of our spirit for every matter in our daily life, our spirit will be very keen and able to touch the fact of a meeting once we enter the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is similar to learning music.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because a person has been learning music consistently, his ears become very sharp and can distinguish a note that is either sharp or flat.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>There are also people whose eyes are trained to accurately determine the size of a piece of land without measuring it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is because they have been trained in their daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, after we are saved, we not only need to love the Lord and follow Him; we also need to exercise the sense in our spirit so that it can be keen.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In this way, it will be easy for us to touch the spiritual fact of a meeting and sense the atmosphere in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Fellowshipping with the Lord and</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Dealing with Everything before the Meeting</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Daily exercise of the sense in our spirit is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Before coming to a meeting, we need to fellowship with the Lord in prayer to deal with everything between Him and us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is dealing with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then our spirit will be enlivened and uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once our spirit is enlivened, uplifted, and refreshed, the feeling in our spirit will be keen, and we can easily touch the feeling of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because some people still have many barriers between them and the Lord, they cannot sense the atmosphere of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Their spirit is dull and numb.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Therefore, such dealing is very important before a meeting.</S>
