Being Condemned</H2><P>Since we have transgressed God's prohibition we not only have a sinful element inwardly, but also a court case outwardly (Rom. 5:18). We have a case in the heavenly court, a case that was built up by Adam, not by us. We were all in Adam; therefore, this case not only concerns Adam, but us all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>f. Bringing in the Curse</H2><P>The first fall of man brought in the curse (vv. 17-19). We may count the items of the curse: the curse itself, sorrow, thorns, thistles, and sweat. These are the items of the curse. Although we are Christians, we often confront harsh circumstances in our attempt to earn a living. In farming, the crop does not grow quickly, but the weeds do. What encourages the weeds to flourish? We pluck them up one day and they reappear soon afterward. This is a sign that the ground was cursed thousands of years ago. Furthermore, in nearly all that we do we must sweat. Without sweating it seems that we cannot accomplish anything. Sweat is the sign that man is under the curse.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>g. Being Cast Out of Paradise</H2><P>As a result of the fall man was also cast out of paradise, out of the realm of life (vv. 23-24). Paradise was the realm of life which included the tree of life and the sphere in which man may receive life. Thus, to be cast out of paradise means to be driven away from the sphere of life.</P><P>According to Genesis 3:23-24, we see that when man was expelled from the garden God guarded the tree of life with cherubim and a flaming sword. The cherubim signified God's glory, the sword God's righteousness, and the flame of fire God's holiness. This means that God's glory, righteousness, and holiness guarded the sphere of life from sinful man until the time that the Lord Jesus came. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to fulfill all the requirements of God's glory, righteousness, and holiness, opening the way for us to enter into the realm of life once again. Now we have a new and living way to enter into the holy of holies to contact the living tree of life (Heb. 10:19-20).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>h. Bringing in Death</H2><P>The ultimate result of man's first fall was death (Gen. 3:19; 5:5; Rom. 5:12). Firstly, man's spirit was deadened and eventually his body will die. Through Adam's transgression sin entered into the world and death through sin. Death reigns over all men (Rom. 5:14, 17). Thus, "in Adam all die" (1 Cor. 15:22).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_120.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_122.html">Next</a> </body></html>
