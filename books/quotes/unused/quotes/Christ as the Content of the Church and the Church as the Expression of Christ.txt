Of course if we have Christ as our life to be His living expression we will behave in the best way having the highest standard of morality
Confucius was a good man, but you do not have the sense of the presence of God or of the expression of God in his life
The members of the church must have the highest standard of morality and of ethics, but our business is not to express morality or ethics
Most Christian teachers cannot differentiate between goodness as the expression of Christ and goodness in itself
Christ is the life, the content, and everything in the church life, and the church is the expression of Christ
Ephesians 3:10 says that through the church the multifarious wisdom of God is made known to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies
Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-the mind, emotion, and will-plus the conscience, a part of our spirit
Christ desires not only to indwell our spirit but also to settle down in all the parts of our soul to occupy the whole human heart
When our spirit is strengthened, Christ has the open and free way to spread out of our spirit into every part of our heart
When all the members of the church are such people, we will be full of strength to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth
When we want to minister something concerning Christ as the content of the church, we have to minister from this portion of the Word
He wants to spread from our spirit into every part of our soul, thus occupying and making His home in our whole being
Our whole being will be filled with the reality of Christ unto all the fullness of God to make us the living expression of Christ
If we were asked to write something about the church, we might write a long book with many chapters of doctrine
We have to make it clear that Christ is the life of the church, the content of the church, and everything to the church
The book of Acts shows us that Christ was the content of the early church, and the church was the expression of Christ
Whenever we minister the word, we have to stress Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ
We have to learn how to minister Christ as the content of the church and the church as the expression of Christ
Romans goes on to tell us how God works in us for our sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification
The cross must do away with all the old things of the old nature, all the things of the self, and all the natural things
Our old nature, our old self, the 'I,' has been done away with by the cross, and all of what Christ is has been wrought into us
There has been a translation from the old nature into the new nature and from the old man into the new man by the cross and the Spirit
We have been justified, but we need to be translated from the old being into the new being, from the old nature into the new nature
From chapter twelve through sixteen, we see the real expression of Christ in the functions of the different members
Perhaps a certain brother, out of the measure of Christ within him, has a burden to give hospitality to many traveling saints
When the saints come to his home, he spontaneously serves them, takes care of them, and displays love, which is Christ expressed through him
Let us consider the experience of another brother, who is being gradually sanctified, overlaid with the divine nature of God
A certain amount of Christ has been wrought into him, so gradually he has the burden to give material things to others
Another brother who has been justified and sanctified to a certain extent may have the heart to always show mercy to others
In this book, which is a full record of the Christian life, there is the expression of Christ and nothing else
The grace is deposited into us that it may become the very outward function and this outward function is the expression of Christ in reality
We need to experience Christ to such an extent and learn to minister Christ as the life, the content, and everything to the church
The end of Romans reveals the church as the Body expressing Christ, but the church in Corinth was expressing something else
The apostle Paul, the writer of 1 and 2 Corinthians, did his best to bring the distracted church back to Christ
The church is God's cultivated land to grow in and with Christ and God's building, the dwelling place of God to be built up as God's temple
The church in Corinth overemphasized the gifts, so Paul somewhat restricted and restrained them from exercising the gifts too much
Of course, Paul did not say that the gifts are wrong or bad, but he did indicate that we need to be limited in exercising the gifts
Corinthians 15:45b shows us that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and chapter two shows us that we need to exercise our spirit
The soulish man cannot apprehend spiritual things, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the reality of all spiritual things
As the members of Christ, we will be built up with others to be the church as the living expression of Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit
The Lord indicated that Paul needed this suffering so that Christ as the sufficient grace and strength might be wrought into him
The persons with Christ wrought into them will be easily built up to be the real and living expression of Christ and nothing else
It speaks of the inner work of the indwelling Christ, the Christ wrought into us by the killing, the 'burning,' of the cross
We are translated from our self into Christ through sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification
The Spirit of Christ , the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, is different from the Spirit of Jehovah who fell upon people in the Old Testament
Since the resurrection and ascension of the Lord Jesus, the Spirit possesses both the divine nature and the human nature
According to Exodus 26:3, five curtains were joined to one another, and the other five curtains were also to be joined to one another
The lampstand was all of gold, signifying the divine nature, but it still had something in it related to human beings
The church as the reality of the tabernacle is built to show forth, manifest, and express Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory
A person approaching the tabernacle from afar would first see the white fine linen hangings of the outer court
There is something white, pure, and clean separating the outer court of the dwelling place of God from worldly things
We can prove this by Hebrews 13:10 which says, 'We have an altar from which they who are serving the tabernacle have no right to eat'
Before the laver cleansed and washed the priests, it told them what they were, giving them a real picture of themselves
As far as your conduct morality and behavior are concerned you may enjoy Christ as your righteousness but this is just the outward aspect
After the people offered the offerings and the shed blood was sprinkled so that they could experience redemption, they began to eat
We do not merely put on Christ as our righteousness, but we also eat Christ as our spiritual food so that He can become our very nature
Our salvation is not a matter of just putting something on but also of taking something in, of eating something
When we are walking in the spirit and not in our natural life, we will enjoy Christ as the glory of God in the Holy of Holies
The natural life, the self, the flesh, the 'I,' has been put away and we are in the spirit, the Holy of Holies
Christ as righteousness, holiness, and glory is the very content of the church life, and the church is the expression of such a Christ
The content of the church is Christ Himself as righteousness, holiness, and glory, and the church is the expression of such a Christ
Both the tabernacle and the offerings show that Christ is the content of the church and the church is the expression of Christ
The building up of the church is seen in Exodus, and the life of the church, a life of meetings, is seen in Leviticus
The central thing in the meetings is the different aspects of Christ as the offerings, so Christ is the center of our church life
The people of Israel had been brought into the good land, and the good land had been allotted to them in lots as their particular portion
Colossians 1:12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
Colossians reveals that Christ is our portion as our inheritance just as the land of Canaan was to the children of Israel
In a certain sense, some brothers who were lazy and did not make their living on Christ 'sold' their portion of Christ
Suppose that we are the Israelites who have been brought into Canaan and have each been allotted a portion of the good land
If we do not labor on our portion of the land, we will suffer poverty as a consequence, even though our portion is very rich
The proper living of the Lord's children is one of working on the portion given to us by God in fear and in love of Him
Out of the produce of this rich harvest, we should keep and separate one-tenth, the best part, with which we can worship God
They had much to live on richly and also had something with which to serve God, to worship God, to meet with the children of God
They would go to the meeting in a poor way, with nothing in their hands to offer, to contribute, with which they could worship God
They have the sunshine, the rain, and the fresh air with the portion of the land, but they do not work on the land
They rarely pray, contact the Lord, study the Word, or enjoy the Lord by feeding on the Lord through the prayerful reading of the Word
If all the children of Israel had come to the feast with empty hands, with nothing to offer, that would have been a 'feast of empty hands'
Sometimes we would think that we have to learn to be humble by saying that we have nothing, but this is not humility
When the Israelites came to the priest to offer something, they did not tell him that they did not have anything
We also have to bring the top surplus of Christ to the church meetings for our worship to God in spirit and reality
According to Numbers 18, all the things offered by the people of Israel were referred to as wave offerings and heave offerings
Whenever we have something of Christ to bring to the church meeting to express Christ this is always something of resurrection and ascension
If we live by Christ day by day, He will cause us to have a proper human living, to have the fine, sweet, proper human behavior
When we have Christ in our living, this Christ who is practical to us will be our fellowship with God and others
We can offer this experience of Christ to God in the church meetings through our thanksgiving, praise, testimony, or message
We need to confess our failures, mistakes, wrongdoings, and shortcomings and apply Christ as our trespass offering
Whenever we come together, regardless of the kind of meeting we have, we should come with the Christ experienced by us
In the Lord's table meeting, we can offer Him as the peace offering for our fellowship with God and man in peace
At the same time, we cannot forget that we are still in the old, sinful nature and that we are sinful in our deeds
Christ will be expressed through us not only in the building up of the church but also in the church life, in all the meetings of the church
Also, when Christ is offered to God in the church meetings in many aspects, the church meetings will be the expression of Christ
We have seen that the offerings in the Old Testament are types of Christ as the reality and content of the church life
Some Christian teachers say that John 424 means that we have to worship God in the spirit and according to the proper doctrines or teachings
Christ does not demand that we honor our parents; instead, He supplies us with what He is to honor our parents
Christ as the embodiment of God came into us to impart all the fullness of God into us, including love, light, holiness, and righteousness
If he takes this fellowship, he will experience Christ spontaneously and unconsciously as the love for his wife
When the brother actually comes to you, you may say, 'The picture was given by Witness Lee, but the reality came through this brother'
There are regulations concerning the offerings, that is, concerning how the children of Israel had to bring their surplus to worship God
These are different aspects of the picture in the Old Testament which portray Christ as the reality of all the offerings
If we know this principle, we will be able to appreciate the relationship between the New Testament and the Old Testament
John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness, or reality
If anyone is going to worship God, he must worship by exercising his spirit and by realizing Christ as the embodiment of God
Verses 33 through 36 say, 'They answered Him, We are Abraham's seed and have never yet been enslaved to anyone
The fullness of the Father dwells in the Son, and the Spirit of reality takes of this fullness and declares it to us
Verse 7 says, 'And thou shalt make curtains of goats' hair to be a covering upon the tabernacle: eleven curtains shalt thou make'
Verse 14 says, 'And thou shalt make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering above of porpoise skins'
The building up of the church is not merely a matter of having an outward pattern but a matter of the birth of life and the growth of life
Every part and aspect of the tabernacle typifies either the work of Christ or Christ Himself being something to us
The tabernacle typifies that by the redemptive work of Christ, He Himself has to be wrought into us as everything in life
By Christ's all-inclusive death on the cross, He accomplished everything needed for us to have a right relationship with God
When we come to Him, confessing that we are sinners and that we have been put to an end by His death, we receive Him
The washing of the Spirit purifies us from all defilement so that we may be pure, clean, and suitable to have Christ wrought into us
After these two items, the real building itself is seen in the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies within the tabernacle
Everywhere in the tabernacle there is something of wood overlaid with gold, signifying the mingling of divinity with humanity
We cannot look in the New Testament merely to find the outward items of the church and then try to form a church according to this pattern
According to the type of the tabernacle, we experience the work of Christ and what He has accomplished for us in the outer court
We experience Christ as the supply of life, the light of life, the resurrection, and the all-inclusive One so that He may be wrought into us
Christ is wrought into us gradually and progressively as everything so that we may grow in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ
In the Spirit of regeneration and the Spirit of maturity we become the material fitly framed and united together as a whole
We also need to realize that regardless of how much Christ has been wrought into us, we can only be good enough to be the boards
Without the picture and pattern of the tabernacle, we could not be so clear about what the church life should be
If you want him to understand what a cat is, you must not only give him the word cat but also show him a picture of a cat
When viewed from the outside by the worldly people, the church seems worthless and coarse like the porpoise skins
Today many in fallen Christianity put pictures of certain persons who minister the Word in the newspapers to advertise them
We will have a proper, strong church life which can withstand any attack and endure any trial or temptation to the end for the glory of God
