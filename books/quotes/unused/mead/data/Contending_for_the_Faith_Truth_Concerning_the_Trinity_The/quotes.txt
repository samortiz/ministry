[1]  CONTENTS Introduction The Revelation of the Triune God According to the Pure Word of the Bible What a Heresy Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-Giving Spirits, and Three God!
[2]  B. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
[3]  Matthew 28:19 speaks clearly of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[4]  In the Spirit of God we have the indwelling God: the Power of God dwelling in human body and working in it what the Father and the Son have for us....what the Father has purposed, and the Son has procured, can be appropriated and take effect in the body of Christ only through the continual intervention and active operation of the Holy Spirit."
[5]  The Father, Son, and Spirit all exist at the same time.
[6]  Notice John 14:16-17: "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality."
[7]  In these two verses we have the Son praying to the Father that the Father would send the Spirit.
[8]  The Bible does not say that the Father existed for a certain period of time and then the Son came; that after a certain period of time the Son no longer existed and was replaced by the Spirit.
[9]  If you say that the Son who is called Father is not the Father, then you must also admit that the child who is called the Mighty God is not the Mighty God.
[10]  Therefore, it is clear: The Lord Jesus is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, the very God and the Lord.
[11]  By the clause, "the Word was with God," we understand that the Word and God are two, for the Word was with God.
[12]  Notice how, in Hebrews 1:8-9, the Son is addressed as God, then God is referred to as His God: "But of the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. therefore God, Your God, has anointed You.
[13]  WHAT A HERESY TWO DIVINE FATHERS, TWO LIFE-GIVING SPIRITS, AND THREE GODS!
[14]  When it comes to the matter of the Triune God, many Christians only care for their tradition, not for the clear, accurate word of the Bible.
[15]  Some of the critics, however, may reply, "Don't you say that the Son is the Father and that Christ is the Spirit?
[16]  Isaiah 9:6 says that a child is born unto us, that a son is given unto us, that the child is called the Mighty God, and that this son is called the everlasting Father.
[17]  If you read this verse carefully, you will see from the context that the Mighty God refers to the child and that the everlasting Father refers to the Son.
[18]  When our critics twist the verse in these ways, we would ask them this question: Do you mean to say that besides the Father of the Three of the Godhead there is another divine Father?
[19]  However the critics interpret this verse, they must recognize that the Son is called the Father and that in the whole universe there is only one divine Father and that this Father is of eternity, without beginning or ending, not the Father of any one age with a beginning and an ending.
[20]  Regardless of how they interpret "the everlasting Father," whether as "the Father of eternity," "the Father of creation," "the Father of the age to come," "the Father of Israel," or the Father of something else, they cannot twist away the title, "the Father" in Isaiah 9:6.
[21]  This verse also says that the Son given to us is called the everlasting Father, and we also believe that the Son is the everlasting Father.
[22]  This verse says, " The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."
[23]  Some twist this verse, saying that it speaks of "a life-giving Spirit," not "the life-giving Spirit."
[24]  Those who twist 1 Corinthians 15:45 in this manner do not know that the Holy Spirit today is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 and even the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 .
[25]  Romans 8:9 testifies that the Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Christ, and Phillipians 1:19 testifies that the Spirit of Christ is also the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[26]  In the Old Testament, He came only as the Spirit of God, but after the resurrection and ascension of Christ, the Spirit came not only as the Spirit of God, but also as the Spirit of the man Christ.
[27]  Now we come to 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, "And the Lord is the Spirit."
[28]  The Spirit in this verse is the Spirit mentioned in verse 6, where we are told that the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
[29]  They say, "If the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three Gods, then how can They be three Persons?"
[30]  Actually, to use the designation "three Persons" to explain the Father, Son, and Spirit is also not quite satisfactory because "three Persons" really means three persons.
[31]  Everything we preach and teach in this ministry is thoroughly and carefully considered.
[32]  Years ago, under the leadership of Brother Watchman Nee, we not only studied the Bible, but also church history, biographies, autobiographies, and the writings of the important Christian teachers.
