   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Desolation of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, when the church became desolate, conditions changed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the time of Paul, the church was already falling into desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul said in the book of Philippians that "all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" Phil 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 2 Timothy he said that all who were in Asia had turned away from him and his ministry 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The descriptions in Peter's epistles are no exception; they all mention the desolation of the church toward the end of the apostles' time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the one hand, Peter speaks in his first epistle of the church as a spiritual house, or a spiritual temple 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the other hand, Peter also spoke of the condition of degradation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John's Epistles also speak of the coming of antichrist and of apostasy in teachings 1 John 2:18; 4:3; 2 John 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These are the conditions of the end times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Revelation 2 and 3, we see that the churches had become so desolate that the Lord could no longer write to the churches; He could only write to the messengers of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The letter to Ephesus in Revelation 2 can be considered "The Second Epistle to the Ephesians."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There the church had forsaken its original condition and had drifted farther and farther away.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's Eyes upon the Spiritual Reality</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Church in the Age of Its Desolation</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What we see today is merely a collection of human methods, doctrines, opinions, criticisms, and quibbles.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Amidst the desolation of the church, we need to learn to exercise judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is true that among all the denominations in Christianity, there are God's people who are still performing worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to admit that there are still sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the ark is not there any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no more testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The only thing that is left is an outward tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God's tabernacle has become desolate, His eyes are turned to the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Today, we who are learning to follow the Lord have to make our choice between the tabernacle and the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some like to follow what is on hand, what is visible, and what is available everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet those who want to follow God have to choose the ark and to go on with it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The position that we should take should be one of spiritual reality, that is, the position typified by the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today the church is the habitation of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this church, there is God's authority and the desire of God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There is also the authority of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord has given to the church the authority of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As such is the case, we can enjoy the power of the coming age in the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Old Testament, the temple and the kingdom are linked together; the temple is the most crucial element in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the same way, the church as the temple is linked to the power of the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is where our way lies today.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, we have to leave the outward tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, we have to seek after God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has pronounced very clear judgment on the outward failures already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His judgment is His removal of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before God, to be without the ark is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the one hand, we have to leave the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the other hand, we have to seek after God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is God's testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Old Testament, God ordered Moses to make two tables of stones, which He called the tables of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On these stones were engraved the ten commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The tables of the law were also called the tables of testimony Exo 34:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ark that God commanded Moses to make was a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Above the ark was the mercy seat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Within the ark was the law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, God did not call the ark the ark of the law, but the ark of testimony Exo 25:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, the law is God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The law is God's demand on man's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How then can it be God's testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We have to realize that, on the one hand, God's testimony is the response of God's demand on man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>On the other hand, God's demand is simply God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where there are the divine demands, there is the divine testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whatever demands God puts on man today, these demands are there to attest to God and to testify God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They testify God's glory, His holiness, and all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The law declares God's demands, and the mercy seat bestows God's grace to man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The testimony is from man to God, and grace is from God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When God's glory is satisfied, there is the mercy seat.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to know that the ten commandments do not refer to the dead laws, but to God's demand on man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This demand is itself a testimony, in which God testifies to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The law maintains God's testimony, and it testifies for God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God has to explain to man His demands, and this explanation is God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Psalm 119 describes God's law as His testimony many times.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a man keeps God's law, he is keeping God's testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every time the word testimony is mentioned in that psalm, it refers to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today the outward church has become weakened and has failed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It has lost the testimony of God and is not able to meet God's demand.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For this reason, there are the disunity, divisions, denominations, and sects.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God demands that man submit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But man cannot meet this demand.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As a result, the testimony is lost, and division is produced.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Although every revivalist comes along and builds a tabernacle, there is no ark of testimony in it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Even when there is a mercy seat, there is no ark.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A man can go to different places to conduct conferences.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>What he is doing is merely moving the tabernacle from one place to another.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What he is maintaining is merely a mercy seat without an ark.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although the ark is not there, the mercy seat is nevertheless put up.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is what men are doing today replacing God's testimony with man's need.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Whenever man's need replaces God's testimony, degradation begins, and problems arise.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>What then is the way for our work today?</S>
