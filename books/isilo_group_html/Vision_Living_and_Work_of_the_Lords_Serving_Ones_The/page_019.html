to Experience the Element of Christ&rsquo;s Death<br />
in the All-inclusive Spirit</h2>
<p>Bible expositors have called Christ in resurrection the &ldquo;pneumatic&rdquo; Christ. After Christ entered into resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. Hence, 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; Concerning the Spirit, in John 7:38-39 the Lord Jesus said that out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him would flow rivers of living water, but the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified. The Spirit that was not yet in John 7:38-39 is in 2 Corinthians 3:17, where Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord is the Spirit.&rdquo; The Christ who passed through death and entered into resurrection is the Spirit. Hence, when we experience Christ as our life, we experience the all-inclusive Spirit, and an important element in the all-inclusive Spirit is the cross.</p>
<p>How do we know that the cross is an important element in the all-inclusive Spirit? In Exodus 30 the first of the four spices is myrrh, which signifies the Lord&rsquo;s death. The first ingredient is always the primary ingredient. When we experience Christ as our life, the element of Christ&rsquo;s death in His life spontaneously has a killing effect within us. For example, when we lose our temper or argue with our wife, we are in our emotion and will, that is, in our soul. Since we know that we should live in our spirit, not in our soul, we turn to our spirit. As soon as we turn to our spirit and touch the Christ within us, this pneumatic Christ will kill our old creation and our flesh and put us on the cross, thus calming us down. This is to experience the life-giving Spirit and the cross of Christ.</p>
<p>For two thousand years those who truly love the Lord and fellowship with Him have had such experiences. Regrettably, they did not have the light that we have today in order to analyze and clearly explain this experience. This is similar to the fact that two hundred years ago no one knew what vitamins were, and even though there was no research related to vitamins, people nonetheless received vitamins from their food. In Shantung Province there was a fishing village near the sea. The people in that village had excellent vision. Later it was discovered that their excellent eyesight was the result of their regularly eating a particular fish in their diet. At that time people did not know the benefits of that fish. Not until the advancement in medicine did we learn that this fish contained a rich supply of vitamin A. Even though the people in that village did not know about vitamin A, they nevertheless received the benefit from this vitamin, and as a result, they had excellent eyesight.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Exhorting Ourselves to Be Crucified<br />
with Christ but Turning to Our Spirit</h2>
<p>Although in the past many saints who truly loved the Lord and fellowshipped with Him did not know the phrase <em>in spirit,</em> they experienced fellowshipping with the Lord in spirit. They fellowshipped with Him continually, and consequently they experienced the killing of the flesh. This is to experience the killing element in the life-giving Spirit. We do not need to repeatedly recite, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ. I am crucified with Christ.&rdquo; Such recitation is ineffective. After hearing or reading a message on being crucified with Christ, a brother may try to practice this. When he is about to explode and the old man is being expressed, he may say that he is crucified with Christ. However, if his wife continues to nag at him, he will be impatient. He will no longer be able to act as if he is on the cross. Since the cross is only a word on his lips, he will eventually lose his temper.</p>
<p>Being crucified with Christ is not the result of repeatedly reciting Galatians 2:20. Being crucified with Christ is the result of turning to our spirit and experiencing Christ as our life. Christ is the life-giving Spirit, and in the Spirit is the element of Christ&rsquo;s death that will kill every negative feeling within us. When a person is sick, he does not repeatedly say that his germs must be killed. If he takes an antibiotic, it will operate in his blood stream, and the germ-killing ingredient in the antibiotic will spontaneously kill the germs in him. Similarly, we do not have to crucify ourselves with Christ. When we are in our spirit, we will spontaneously experience the death of the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO EXPERIENCE<br />
THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT<br />
AND THE ALL-INCLUSIVE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We must experience the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ. Many saints in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery have a heart to pursue the Lord but may not have definite experiences of the Spirit of life and the cross of Christ. This has not become a habit in their living. Only when this is our experience can we lead others into this experience. Then it will not be so easy for us to lose our temper. Furthermore, we will be those who are truly one spirit with the Lord. In His all-inclusive death we can be one spirit with Him. When we are one spirit with Him in His death, we will also be one with Him in His resurrection and ascension.</p>
<p>When we experience the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ, our growth in life will deepen. Then we will be able to lead others into these experiences. If we are short in experience, we will not have a thorough understanding, even if we have read many spiritual books. My fellowship with you is brief but succinct. The process advancing from preaching the gospel, which leads new believers to salvation, to bringing new believers into the realm of ascension has to be accomplished by continually experiencing the all-inclusive Spirit and the all-inclusive death of Christ.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Living and Work of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
