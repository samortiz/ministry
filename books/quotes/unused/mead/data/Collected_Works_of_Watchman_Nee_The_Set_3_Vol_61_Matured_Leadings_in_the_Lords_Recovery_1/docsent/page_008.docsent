   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNING SPIRITUAL ATMOSPHERE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: In my work, I find that there often is the need but that I lack boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the root of my problem?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Watchman Nee: Whether or not our work is a success or a failure depends on whether we bring a proper atmosphere to a place or whether the atmosphere in a place affects us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church in Canton has its own atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church in Hong Kong also has its own atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we move from Hong Kong to Canton, do we allow the Canton atmosphere to get into us, or do we bring our atmosphere to the church?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is not a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not drumming up a certain kind of atmosphere purposely.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such promotion is false.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet at the same time, we cannot passively allow the local atmosphere to affect us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, we will be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to carry a spirit of freedom with us wherever we go, yet we should not pretend or perform.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The human body needs fresh air in order to live and move freely.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Spiritually speaking, we also need fresh air to feel free and refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever I go to a new place, I always check the spiritual "air" in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I try to find out whether the atmosphere is fresh and living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order to have fresh "air," we have to learn to not offend the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must also learn to not offend the atmosphere that is brought in by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is a serious thing to offend the Spirit or the atmosphere brought in by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may find that a place has some needs, but feel weak and unable to do anything about them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, the Holy Spirit will not have a spiritual atmosphere in which to release Himself, and this will cause the "air" in that place to be contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we ignore our feeling of weakness, the Holy Spirit will secure a proper spiritual atmosphere to release Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the atmosphere is right, it is easy to work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the first thing we should do when we get to a place is to bring in a proper atmosphere, an atmosphere of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then we can work freely.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Let me repeat, however: This is not a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first thing we should do when we get to a new place is to ignite the fire of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must be armed with a gospel spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These things are greatly related to the spiritual atmosphere of a place.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the gospel meetings in Hankow, we had six to eight hundred attendants every day.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Lan Tsi-yi reported that as soon as a person stepped into the meeting, he felt a different atmosphere; it was totally different from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many people were subdued the very first day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They confessed their sins with weeping and pleaded for salvation on their knees.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must have a gospel spirit before we can light the gospel fire, but there must be a proper atmosphere before we can light the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the atmosphere is wrong, it is hard to ignite the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our efforts only add to the weight of the burden.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to ask God again and again to show us if we have offended the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit in any matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether or not we can ignite the gospel fire is a serious matter; it is a test from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This test will show us that nothing can be done in a casual way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before we do anything, we must first ask whether or not we have offended the Spirit's atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let me give another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In one gospel conference, a brother was the song leader during the second meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He did not sing well, and the songs were out of tune.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet the atmosphere of the meeting was wonderful, and dozens and even hundreds of people confessed their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On the sixth day the brothers decided to ask this brother to take over the whole meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This time it was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He offered a long prayer, and he conducted the singing himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Afterwards he gave a long message.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the end he sang, gave the altar call, and invited the new ones to write down their names.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The result was a fiasco.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One brother reported later that only fifteen minutes of the entire meeting had a right spiritual atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must never say or do anything that offends the spiritual atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I first was saved, I conducted a ten-day gospel campaign with some co-workers of mine.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I learned many things from that campaign.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There were many good confessions from many sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even four beggars were saved in a genuine way.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Not only do we need the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit in our gospel preaching; we need it in maintaining the church and the work.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is much to learn in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Miss Betteridge: I have an inward burden to work for the Lord, but I am overwhelmed by the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I do not have a co-worker to work together with me, and I cannot find anyone that can pray with me in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result, I have become cold and dead.</S>
