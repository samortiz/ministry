   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Word of the Father</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord sowed the seed of life into His disciples and gave them the Father's name.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He also gave them the word of the Father John 17:8, 14, 17-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word of God sanctifies the believers, separating them from all things other than God v. 17 . The things of the world within us are a replacement of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we need the sanctification in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The more we read the Bible, the more we are sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word of the Bible is like water washing us, cleansing us, and purifying us, purging our being of all things other than God Eph 5:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The longer we live in this world, the more of this world we accumulate and pick up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This "picking up" always replaces God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, we need the word to sanctify us, to wash us and cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Glory of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord prayed that the believers would be one in the divine glory for the expression of the Triune God John 17:22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The glory which the Father has given the Son is the sonship with the Father's life and divine nature 5:26 to express the Father in His fullness 1:18; 14:9; Col 2:9; Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus has given us this glory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He has given us the divine sonship so that we can be sons of God to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to realize that we are glorious because we are the sons of God to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not go shopping in a light way, because we are sons of God expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We do not want to lose our glorious status as sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is in this glory, the glory of the Triune God, that we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are one in the name of the Father, in the life of the Father, in the word of the Father, and in the glory of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One in the Triune God as the Triune God Is One for the Expression of the Lord's Glory</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are one in the Triune God John 17:21, 23 , and we are one as the Triune God is one vv.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>11, 21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our oneness is the oneness in the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 17 the Lord prayed for His believers to be one in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verses 21-23a say, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one; I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one." The three of the Godhead are one, and we are one in Their oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the unique oneness in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, our oneness is the oneness of the Divine Trinity, the divine oneness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since the Triune God is our oneness, we should not have any division among us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This oneness is for the expression of the Lord's glory John 17:1-3, 22, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we all remain in the divine oneness, the real glory is expressed among us to the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord prayed for this divine oneness in the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe this prayer is still prevailing over us today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is the need of the recovery today because many Christians have been divided by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the history of the church, there was the development of Roman Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Christians divided from the Roman Catholic Church into the state churches such as the Church of England and the Church of Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There was a third division from the Catholic Church and the state churches to private churches, or denominations, such as the Baptist, Presbyterian, and Methodist denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A fourth and even further division are the free groups.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we stand as one with and receive all the Lord's children, His believers, we do not agree with any of these divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot leave our standing of oneness to join others in their divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not create or make any division.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have the oneness of the Triune God, and we are one in Him for His expression, His glory.</S>
