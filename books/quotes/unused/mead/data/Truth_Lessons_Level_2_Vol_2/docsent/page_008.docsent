   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Caring Only for His Own Existence,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not for God s Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Cain was a server of the ground Gen 4:2b, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>. To serve the ground is to earn a living, which is for the sustaining of one s own existence, not for God s purpose in His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that although Cain knew God, he cared only for his own existence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He cared neither for God s purpose nor for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Throughout the ages, all unbelievers have been toiling and laboring in order to earn a living.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They diligently serve the earth, not God, and they care only for themselves, not for God or for God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>D. Becoming the Representative</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>of All Those Who Refuse to Take</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s Way of Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Cain served God religiously according to his own way and after his own will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He rejected the redemption by blood that was required and ordained by God, and according to the flesh he envied and murdered Abel, a faithful witness of God Gen 4:4-5, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eventually, he was rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, Cain took the godless way, which is not the way of redemption ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, the way of Cain became a model Jude 11a , representing the way of death taken by all godless people throughout the ages, a way that is out of death, in death, and unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>E. Becoming the Representative</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>of All Those Who Murder</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because of Religious Jealousy</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Cain is also the representative of all those who murder the real worshippers of God because of religious jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This exactly corresponds to the word of the Lord Jesus in John 16:2: An hour is coming when everyone who kills you will think that he is offering service to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>History confirms that the Roman Catholic Church has killed more genuine Christians than the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Roman Catholic Church alleged that the believers of Jesus were heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, after the time of Martin Luther, one of the items in an oath taken by Catholic bishops was that they had to persecute those who held heretical beliefs.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Several popes even passed edicts ordering Catholics to destroy all those whom they called heretics.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One of the popes said that a person could redeem himself from his sin of murdering a Catholic if he killed a Protestant.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just in Rome alone, over one million nine hundred thousand Christians were killed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus, Revelation 17:6 says that the woman, the Roman Catholic Church, was drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All these historical facts are represented by Cain s murdering of his brother Abel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All such murderers are walking on the same pathway as Cain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>ABEL A. His Name Meaning Vanity, Like a Breath</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eve gave birth again, to Cain s brother Abel Gen 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Abel means vanity, like a breath.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This name may indicate that, because they were disappointed with their first child, Cain, Adam and Eve had the feeling and concept that the life of fallen man was vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Their second son, whom they begot and named Abel, must have inherited the same realization and feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>B. Knowing God and Taking God s Way</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In contrast to Cain, Abel not only knew God but also took God s way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to God s foreordained redemption, he presented an offering of God s delight with the shedding of blood; that is, he offered the firstlings of the flock and the fat of the lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, he was justified by God Gen 4:4; Heb 11:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In taking such a way of redemption, he believed in the God-ordained offerings according to God s revelation; he neither acted according to his preference nor trusted in his deeds or works.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He knew that as a fallen sinner he could not cover or conceal his sinfulness with his own works and by his own behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He realized that he needed to present an offering with the shedding of blood for his redemption Heb 9:22 and for the satisfying of God s righteous requirement that he might be accepted by God and have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What Abel did corresponded exactly to the requirements of the Mosaic law, which was given later.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This proves that the way of redemption that he took in worshipping God was according to God s divine revelation and not according to his concept.</S>
