   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED FOR A GOVERNING VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We all need a governing, directing, controlling vision of the Triune God as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we see this vision, we shall be governed and directed by it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I can testify that by the Lord s mercy I saw this vision more than half a century ago, and I have not been distracted from it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This vision continues to control, govern, and direct me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My life is not aimless, for I have a definite goal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Throughout the years, the vision I have seen concerning the Triune God as my goal has strengthened me and upheld me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we see the vision of the Triune God as our goal, we shall not sow unto the flesh, but unto the Spirit, the all-inclusive Triune God dwelling in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This living Person should be our goal, and we should aim at Him in all we do, say, and are.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul knew that the Galatian believers were mistaken in aiming at the law and circumcision, which God had repudiated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wanted them to come back to the life-giving Spirit, the One who is the totality of the blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It seems as if Paul were saying to the Galatians, Believers in Galatia, come back to the Spirit, take Him as the goal of your living, and aim at Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This Spirit is the all-inclusive blessing of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>FULFILLING OUR NEED TO LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Taking the Spirit as our goal is quite different from trying not to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We were created with the capacity to love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to love something.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you offer people something to love that is better than the world, they will love that instead of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, because people have nothing better, they love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is too shallow to charge Christians not to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As human beings, we have the desire to love something, and this desire needs to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it is satisfied by loving the Triune God, the One who is real, living, present, and subjective to us, we shall have no capacity to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Something infinitely better than the world the Triune God as the life-giving Spirit has taken full possession of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Believers are delivered from loving the world not by teaching, but by loving the Triune God and being filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After I had preached the gospel one night in the city of Nanking many years ago, a young woman said to me, Mr. Lee, I agree with all you have said, and I appreciate the Christ you preach.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, I love the theater very much, and I want to know whether or not I shall have to give up the theater if I become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As I considered how to answer her question, I noticed that her little boy was with her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then I said, Suppose while you are talking with me your son picks up a sharp knife and plays with it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What would you do?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She told me that she could deal with the situation very easily by offering the child several pieces of chocolate candy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She told me she was sure that the child would drop the knife and fill his hands with candy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There would be no need to tell him to put the knife away, because he would be fully occupied with the candy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I said to her, Don t you realize that attending the theater is like playing with a sharp knife and Christ can be compared to that candy?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you fill your hands with Christ, you will have no interest in this knife.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She smiled and said that she was pleased with my answer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This incident illustrates the fact that it is not necessary to teach believers not to love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to present something better to occupy their love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our need to love is filled by taking the Triune God as our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This goal is immeasurably greater than anything the world has to offer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>CONSTITUTED OF THE SPIRIT AND MADE NEW</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we sow unto the Triune God, we shall walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then spontaneously we shall be the new creation in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The meaning of the new creation is that God, the divine Spirit, mingles Himself with us and constitutes us with Himself to make us new.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The ethical teachings of Confucius may improve people s behavior, but they cannot reconstitute anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when we aim at the Triune God and walk by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the Spirit imparts the divine element into us and reconstitutes us with it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, we no longer remain the old creation but become a new creation with a divine element wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The ultimate issue of this will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today the church people in the Lord s recovery are undergoing the process of becoming reconstituted of the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are not aiming at self-correction or self-improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our goal is not to learn patience or to develop the capacity to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such things are not the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The new creation is a matter of God s chosen people taking the all-inclusive Spirit as their goal, aiming at Him, being one spirit with Him, and, as a result, having the divine element transfused into them to reconstitute them and make them new.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>WALKING BY THIS RULE</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 6:16 Paul says, And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The rule in this verse is not that of keeping the law, improving ourselves, or obeying religious ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The rule is to aim at the Triune God and walk by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Those who walk by this rule will have peace and mercy.</S>
