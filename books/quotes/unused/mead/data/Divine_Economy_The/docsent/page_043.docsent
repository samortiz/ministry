   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul tells us in Romans 8:4 that we need to walk according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not walk according to your mind, your emotion, or your will.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Simply walk according to spirit, because the Lord and His grace are in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you call upon Him and open up yourself to Him to enjoy His riches and to walk according to spirit, the Lord will gain more ground within you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then He will make your inner man with all your inward parts His home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He will make His home in your heart to occupy your entire being Eph 3:16-17a and thus become your full enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In yourself you cannot overcome your lust, your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the indwelling Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit who is Christ Himself, occupies you and makes His home in your heart, filling you with Himself, you will crucify your flesh Gal 5:24 and put to death the practices of your lustful body Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By yourself you do not have the energy or the ability to deal with your flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But when Christ occupies you, making His home in your whole being, filling you up with Himself, you will be filled with energy and strength to crucify your lustful body, the flesh, to put your body to death to overcome all kinds of lustful things and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually this is not you, but Christ who lives in you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As you are living Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit who indwells your spirit will dispense life into you all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the switch to an electric fan is turned on, the electricity is being dispensed into the fan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As long as the fan turns and moves, the electricity is being dispensed into it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's economy is His plan to dispense Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He desires to do this every day and every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we live Christ by walking according to the indwelling, all-inclusive Spirit, this Spirit gives life into our being, dispensing the Triune God as the all-inclusive life supply into us for us to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This enjoyment is our drinking of the Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While the electricity is being dispensed into the electric fan and while the fan is moving and turning, the fan is "drinking" of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As the fan "drinks" and "enjoys" the electricity, it spontaneously turns.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we enjoy the "divine electricity" of the Spirit, we spontaneously walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is not religion but God's economy the enjoyment of the Triune God embodied in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is absolutely different from today's religious system centered on ethical teachings.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the Triune God for our enjoyment.</S>
