   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Raising Up Churches in Taiwan</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When I arrived in Taiwan in 1949, the church in Taipei was the only relatively large church on the island.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We met in a Japanese-style house on Shanghai Road, which is presently Lin Sen South Road; there were about one hundred people in the meetings, eighty to ninety percent of whom had come from the mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Brothers Chang Wu-chen, Sun Feng-lu, Liu Hsiao-liang, and Chao Ching-huai had been sent by the co-workers in mainland China to Taiwan at the end of 1948.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because the church in Taipei was small and weak, the co-workers asked these four brothers to take the responsibility to lead the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was the first strengthening of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In January 1949 Brother Chang Yu-lan and more than seventy brothers and sisters from the College of Medicine run by the Nationalist government s Department of Defense arrived in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were the second strengthening of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brother Chang Yu-lan had been a responsible brother in the church in Nanking; thus, when he came to Taipei, he was brought into taking the lead in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In May the Lord led me to Taiwan, and even more saints came at that time; that was the third strengthening of the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The second largest church in Taiwan was the church in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Lin Mu-hsiang and his family were gained by the Lord in Chefoo in 1942 and 1943; after China won the Sino-Japanese War, he was sent by the Nationalist government to collect port duties in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he and his wife arrived in Kaohsiung, they began to meet in their own home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the end of 1948 Brothers Chu Hsun-min and Cheng Ta-chiang came to Kaohsiung from Tsingtao and Shanghai respectively.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Several of their colleagues also came to Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through this, the church in Kaohsiung was strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, there were two relatively strong churches in Taiwan, one in the northern part and one in the southern part of the province.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A brother who recently graduated from the engineering department of the National Chiao Tung University came to Keelung in 1948 for an engineering apprenticeship at the Keelung Shipyards.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before he left Shanghai, he had a lengthy time of fellowship with me; he did not want to leave Shanghai and was afraid that by being alone in Keelung he would miss the spiritual leading in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, he accepted the arrangement because of the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he arrived in Keelung, he met Brother Lee Wei-yi from Nanking, who was working as an engineer at a fertilizer factory, and they began to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church in Taichung began in the same way when brothers came there from the mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers Abel Chu and Liu Chiu-fei arrived first; they were both serving in the Air Force.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One was a chemical engineer, and the other was assistant director of a medical college.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When they arrived in Taichung, they began to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1949 there was no church in Chiayi.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A sister named Chu Chih-pu worked as a health educator in Chiayi, and before I visited the southern part of the island for the second time, she wrote a letter asking me to visit her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When I went, I met Brother Liu Kuang-chih.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They used a public place in Sister Chu s workplace to begin to have prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church in Hsinchu began through Sister Chu Chih-pu and some other sisters who went to Hsinchu to teach health education.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later, Brother Cheng Pao-chih graduated from teachers college and went to Hsinchu to teach school; this strengthened the church in Hsinchu.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way the churches were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>According to our statistics, about four hundred brothers and sisters came to Taiwan from mainland China in the earliest group.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were scattered in the large cities throughout the province.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These brothers and sisters were seeds sown by the Lord, and they raised up churches in locality after locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At present there are fifty-nine localities, and not one was established through the Lord s workers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All these churches were raised up through working brothers and sisters who moved to various places for their jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the end of July 1949 we moved Hall 1 of the church in Taipei to its present location.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The previous meeting hall only seated three hundred people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>On August 1 we formally began the work with the first conference; that conference was the official beginning of the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Three months from today it will have been seven years since we began the work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In these seven years, aside from those brothers in outlying areas who are building up the local service, we have carried out the following main items of work.</S>
