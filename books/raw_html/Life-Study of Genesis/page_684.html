<P>When the Lord Jesus comes, the whole earth will be under one landlord and one banker. All the land will belong to Christ, and we shall hand over whatever we have and whatever we are to Him. We are the enjoyers, not the lords. At that time in Egypt everything was under the hand of one lord. Joseph moved the people to cities "from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof" (47:21) in order to have an even distribution. There were no rich and no poor. It is the same today regarding the spiritual supply. Christ has the riches. The amount of these riches that He is able to supply us depends on what we are willing to pay. If we are willing to make the first payment, then we shall receive the first supply. But if we are willing to make the other payments, we shall receive more supply. If we make the fourth payment, we shall receive not only the food to satisfy ourselves, but also the seed to produce something for others. How marvelous this is!</P><P>If you study Genesis 47, you will see that eventually the whole land of Egypt became a land of enjoyment. No longer were there distinctions between high and low and rich and poor. All the people became enjoyers on the same level because everyone and everything was under the same lord. This is a picture of the millennium. In the millennium there will be no capitalism or socialism. Everyone will be on the same level because everything will be under the Lord's hand. He will have bought everything, and He will have claimed everything and everyone. Truly the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof (Psa. 24:1).</P><P>The situation during the millennium will be very different from today. Before Joseph came to the throne, the people were on different levels. But after he was enthroned and the people came to him for food, Egypt became a prefigure of the millennium with all the people on the same level. Everything was under one man and belonged to him because that man had the riches and could claim everything. It must be this way among us in the church life today. Because Christ has claimed everything of us, we all are now on the same level enjoying the riches of Christ. All the points mentioned above also are seeds that are developed in the New Testament.</P><P>Joseph not only supplied the people with food, but also took care of his father's burial (49:29-31; 50:1-14). The burial of Jacob was not a simple matter. According to Hebrews 11, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all received the promise of the good land, but died without inheriting it. This is a strong indication of resurrection. Abraham died with the expectation that he would be resurrected. No doubt Isaac and Jacob had the same concept. Jacob died in the hope that one day he would rise up to inherit the land. For this reason, he charged Joseph not to leave his body in Egypt, but to bury him in the land of his fathers. Jacob realized that death to him was a time of sleeping and that on the day of resurrection he would rise up to inherit the good land. This is the significance of the burial of Jacob. The fact that Joseph buried him according to his request indicates that he had the same faith as his father. He also believed that they would rise up to inherit the good land.</P><P>Joseph also supported his brothers and comforted them (50:15-21). Joseph's brothers could not forget what they had done to him, and they were afraid that after their father's death Joseph would do something to get revenge. Joseph wept when he heard his brothers' request, for he had no thought of rendering evil to them. Rather, he said, "Fear not: for am I in the place of God? But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive" (50:19-20, Heb.). Joseph also promised to support them and their little ones. Then he comforted them and spoke kindly to them (50:21). Joseph seemed to be saying to his brothers, "Your intention was evil, but God's intention was marvelous. He intended to send me here to save many lives. Please do not be bothered. I thank you for what you did to me. You helped God to fulfill His purpose." In the church life we need this kind of spirit. Even if others offend you, you need to consider that whatever they do to you is of God. If you take everything as of God, all the offenses will be over.</P>
