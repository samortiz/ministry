He made Miss Chin, one of the sisters responsible for the work, sick. But another brother helped, replacing her in the work. A Gentile who was possessed by a demon came. In the meeting, there was a brother who was cheated by an evil spirit. (This brother meets in another locality; he is one in the fellowship, who had come to stay here.) There was the attack of the Gentiles and confusion in the meeting. The workers were weak, and darkness was on all sides. The atmosphere was very tense. But our Lord is the Commander-in-chief. The battle plan did not change; the work went on as usual. In our prayers we added more praise and thanks. We sang songs of victory. Hallelujah, we fought persistently for three days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Change in the Situation</H2><P>The Lord is the Victor! The Gentile demon was cast out. The evil spirit who had tricked the brother temporarily left him. His mind became clear. Miss Chin's illness gradually got better, and she was healed in a few days.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Final Victory</H2><P>The sisters' work ended on schedule. Most of the sisters who lived far away went home and arrived safely. At the end of the work, four sisters were baptized, and so were four brothers. (The brothers had received the Lord in another work.) The demon completely left the Gentile. Now she comes to hear the message on the Lord's Day. The brother who had been tricked by the evil spirit became completely clear in his mind and told us himself how he had been tricked (explained in another place). He got on the train by himself and returned to his own town. We gained experience in this battle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Those Who Gained Experience</H2><P>When the enemy was roaring, a few of us brothers in this locality (those who pray in one accord) gained a living experience in the matter of spiritual warfare. At the same time, we proved the reality of the truth. Therefore, on May 7 we were willing to serve the brothers in the dormitories.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Beginning of the May 7 Conference</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Preparation of the Meeting Place</H2><P>When we sent out the letter of announcement about the conference, we did not yet have any assurance about the meeting place. As the sisters' work was almost over, a brother finally was able to borrow a bigger place, which was the place we had specifically asked for in our prayers. It had nineteen buildings; the dormitories, meeting rooms, and dining halls were all in one place. There were no difficulties.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Brothers Who Came to the Meetings</H2><P>There are more than ten localities in northern Kiangsu with meetings in the Lord's name. With the exception of one or two places who could not come because of obstacles, there were one hundred responsible brothers and sisters from the other localities who came. With the addition of the local congregation, there were a little more than two hundred people. Among these some had overcome everything to come; some put every consideration aside. I really thank the Lord; He can draw people. "My sheep hear My voice." "Where I am, there also My servant will be." This word is true. The people we had notified were not the only ones to come to the conference. Some preachers from the denominations also came to hear the Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Time of the Meetings</H2><P>We met from 9:30 to 11:30 in the morning. There was another meeting in the afternoon from 3:00 to 5:00. In the evening we came together for a prayer meeting from 8:00 to 9:00.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Topic of the Messages</H2><P>The topic was "The Messengers of the Churches." It covered Christ as the Head of the church, how the messengers should obey Christ, who is a responsible messenger in the churches, the relationship between the messengers and the church, and the messengers and their living. The first few days, Brother Chi Yung Tung was responsible for the messages. The last three days, Brother Chiu Jih Chien spoke on the faithfulness and tests of the messengers and on the responsibility which each person should bear in the local churches. Wu Min Hui spoke a little on the battles of the messengers. I spoke something on the warnings to the messengers and the oneness of the church. Brother Ting Yi Yuan wanted to speak something on the authority of the church, but the hateful enemy frustrated him. When it was time for him to speak, he got sick. (He is well now.)</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_066.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_068.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 67</div><br></body></html>
