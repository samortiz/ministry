<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class=msg>(12)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 16:16-24</h1><p>In this message we shall consider the sign of the newborn child (16:16-24).<p>For many years I was bothered by this portion of the Gospel of John, especially by the Lord’s word in verse 21 concerning a man that is born into the world. I asked, “Who is this man? The Lord Jesus was to be put to death. How can a man be born?” I could not understand these verses. Furthermore, I thought that when the Lord told His disciples that they would see Him (vv. 16-17, 19, 22), He was referring to His second advent. I was also puzzled by the words “a little while” in verses 16 through 19. If this refers to the period of time between the Lord’s death and His coming back, it seemed to me that this length of time, which has lasted more than nineteen centuries, is not a “little while.” By this you can see that in the past I had a number of problems with this portion of the Word. Because I was eager to understand the Bible, especially the Gospel of John, these questions kept bothering me.<h2 class=head1>A RECONSIDERATION OF CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2><p>In 1958 the Lord enlightened me regarding certain matters in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John. In my study I was seeking to understand what the Lord means by the Father’s house and what is signified by His going and coming. I was not satisfied with the interpretation which said that the Lord’s going was His going to the heavens and that His coming denoted His second advent. It seemed to me that there was something wrong with this interpretation of the Lord’s word concerning His coming in these chapters. I realized, of course, that the vine in chapter fifteen is not something for the future; the vine and the branches are present now. Today we need to abide in Christ, and today He abides in us. Chapter fifteen describes something that is in the present. This caused me to question even more the common interpretation of the Father’s house and the Lord’s going and coming.<p>In my study of the Gospel of John I saw that the expression “My Father’s house” is used twice in this book (2:16; 14:2). In 2:16 the Father’s house refers to the temple on earth; it has nothing whatever to do with the heavens. In this chapter the Lord indicates that He Himself in resurrection eventually will be the temple (2:19-21). I realized that, according to a basic principle in interpreting the Bible, the phrase “My Father’s house” should not have a meaning in 14:2 that is different from the meaning of the same phrase in 2:16. Therefore, since the Father’s house in 2:16 refers not to the heavens but to the temple on earth, then the Father’s house in 14:2 should also refer to His house on earth. In other words, in both 2:16 and 14:2 the Father’s house refers to the temple.<p>With this understanding of the Father’s house as the basis, I reconsidered how to interpret the Lord’s going and coming in chapter fourteen. Then I saw that the Lord’s going clearly refers to His death and that His coming was His coming back to His disciples in resurrection. I began to understand that through this process of death and resurrection the Lord prepared the way for us to enter into God, and that this is the way for us to be in the Father’s house. Furthermore, I began to see that the abode in 14:23 denotes one of the many abodes in the Father’s house spoken of in verse 2. Certainly, the abode in verse 23 is a believer. Likewise, the abodes in verse 2 are not rooms in a heavenly mansion, but believers. I was happy to have received the proper understanding of John 14.<p>Most Christians think that the Father’s house in John 14 refers to a heavenly mansion. At a funeral a minister will often comfort those who have lost a loved one by saying something like this: “Your departed loved one has gone to be in a heavenly mansion. Because he is in a better place, there is no need for you to weep. One day, all Christians will go to such a heavenly mansion, to a place with gates of pearl and streets of gold.” When I saw the proper understanding of the Father’s house, I realized that the common teaching concerning a heavenly mansion is superstitious and even deceptive. We should not preach any kind of falsehood; instead, we should only preach the truth. The common teaching concerning a heavenly mansion has no basis in the Bible, and especially no basis in the Gospel of John.<p>The Gospel of John speaks of divine things. For example, John 1:1 says that in the beginning was the Word, and that the Word was God. This is divine. In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus says, “I am the way, and the reality, and the life; no one comes to the Father except through Me.” In this verse there is nothing physical; everything is divine. In keeping with this principle, although the Father’s house in John 14 refers to a temple, His dwelling place on earth, it is nevertheless a divine, spiritual matter. The Father’s house is not a physical mansion in the heavens. The Lord’s building is not such a mansion. The Lord’s building today is the church. In the New Testament the church is called the house of the living God (1 Tim. 3:15). This living house of the living God is the Father’s house. Therefore, we may have the assurance to say that what is revealed in chapter fourteen of John is not a heavenly mansion. The Father’s house is not a physical entity. The Father’s house is God’s church, the Body of Christ. Moreover, this house is the vine described in chapter fifteen, and the vine is an organism, not an organization. Hence, the Father’s house in John 14 is the vine, the living organism, in chapter fifteen.
