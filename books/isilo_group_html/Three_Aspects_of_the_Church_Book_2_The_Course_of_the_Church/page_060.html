<p>A person who has truly been called does not need to study theology. Over the past twenty or thirty years, the Lord has raised up many people who never studied theology. Most of those who have studied theology have no spiritual weight. Organized Christianity considers pastoring a profession and theology a skill. The study of theology is treated as if a person is equipping himself with a skill in order to engage in a certain profession; someone who wants to be a doctor studies medicine, and someone who wants to be a pastor studies theology. Yenching University, Chi-lu University, and St. John&rsquo;s University all have theological seminaries; moreover, there are many schools that teach theology exclusively. The thought is that in order to be a pastor, one must first study theology. After the Lord raised us up, there was a testimony that believers could receive revelation directly from God and do not need to study theology. This was a recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF SPIRITUAL WARFARE</h2>
<p>Brother Nee told us that 1928 was a year of strong recoveries. Although there were many recoveries in the beginning in 1920, we still had not recovered the matter of spiritual warfare. Spiritual warfare was not recovered until the first overcomer conference in 1928. The messages in that conference were on God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, the kingdom of God, and the way to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. At that time the matter of spiritual warfare was recovered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF TAKING CHRIST AS THE CENTER<br />
AND OF THE OVERCOMERS</h2>
<p>In early 1934, in the third overcomer conference, Brother Nee shared on Christ as God&rsquo;s centrality and universality and on God&rsquo;s overcomers. The messages in this conference were very high, and they released a great recovery to the brothers and sisters in China.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE OVERCOMING LIFE</h2>
<p>During the three years from 1934 to 1936, we emphasized the matter of the overcoming life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
THE SPREADING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>In the past we were not clear concerning the spreading of the church from Antioch. This light did not become clear to us until 1937.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF KNOWING THE BODY</h2>
<p>We began to see the matter of knowing the Body in 1938 and 1939.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY<br />
OF SERVICE IN COORDINATION</h2>
<p>In 1939 and 1940, after we began to know the Body, we started to see the service in coordination in the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
THE CHURCH PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>The matter of the church preaching the gospel was completely recovered in the years between 1940 and 1943. This recovery reached its peak in northern China. Whenever the church preached the gospel, it involved all the saints moving together; that was a living and strong recovery. The best time period was in 1942 and 1943, when the entire church preached the gospel; everyone opened his home for the gospel. The entire church served in all aspects of the gospel work, including inviting friends, visiting people, and leading people to be saved. At that time the gospel was countless times stronger than it is today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF MIGRATION</h2>
<p>At the beginning of 1943 we saw the light of migration; the gospel spreads not only through the preaching of the apostles but also through the migration of the saints. Wherever the saints go, the gospel is planted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF<br />
EXPERIENCING THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h2>
<p>The recovery of experiencing the indwelling Christ began after 1942 and continued through the end of the Sino-Japanese War. The experience of the indwelling Christ is deeper than knowing the overcoming life. Many brothers and sisters went through trials during the war and learned these lessons very well. Although they had known the overcoming life and recognized Christ as life in their being, their experience was not up to the standard of experiencing the indwelling Christ. Everyone, especially some weighty brothers and sisters, passed through trials at the end of the war, and in many places the work stopped completely. Therefore, many brothers and sisters pursued the inner fellowship with the Lord and learned to experience the indwelling Christ. Thus, after the war ended, many messages spontaneously emphasized this matter.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_059.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_061.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 60</div><br></body></html>
