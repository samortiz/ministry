<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">HOW TO HANDLE THE ITEMS<br />THAT HAVE BEEN HANDED OVER</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:Tuesday, February 7, 1950<br />Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</h1><h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2><p>Brother Weigh: Lord, You are the Head of the church. The church is Your Body. We pray that the church will receive something from You as the Head. May Your Body feel what the Head feels. May it be directed by the Head and receive supply from the Head. May each member in the Body receive the same rich supply from the Head. Lord, in ourselves we can do nothing. May Your anointing be with us, and may Your church speak the right things and make the right decisions. May the church be under Your full control. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHURCH ON EARTH<br />BEING THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2><p>Watchman Nee: The gospel is a work that the Lord has assigned to the church. The church exists on the earth for the gospel. The entire New Testament shows us clearly that the responsibility of the church is to preach the gospel. Last night we went one step further and saw that the preaching of the gospel by the church means that the preaching is not done by just a few people. We do not preach when we are hot and stop when we are cold. It is not a preaching in which each person takes turns being burning and preaching by himself. The whole church has to rise up to preach in coordination. Evangelism is a matter of the whole church. The whole church has to further the gospel of God in one accord. The church has the responsibility of joining hands together to preach the gospel. The church is the Body of Christ; it is always active. Therefore, the gospel should always be moving; there must not be any lull. In the early church, we find men who handed themselves over. Today we should see men doing the same thing, not just in ones and twos, but as a whole. Everyone has to offer up himself as well as his all. If only a few offer up themselves, or worse still, if none offer up themselves as in the past, the gospel will never reach the uttermost part of the earth.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE ITEMS THAT WERE HANDED OVER</h2><p>Tonight we will address the brothers and sisters who have handed themselves over. We are not going to give a message. Instead, we would like to have a talk with you. We want to say something on the negative side as well as something on the positive side. Presently, we have a good number of saints who have handed themselves over. I hope that you can testify to the other brothers and sisters how you have willingly forsaken everything to follow the Lord. We want to make suitable arrangements concerning the items that have been handed over. We want to do this according to the Lord's heart. We do not want to make mistakes with the things that have been handed over. We hope that we can make proper arrangements. We should address two matters&mdash;first the things that have been handed over and then the very persons who have handed themselves over, including what to do with their future. There are two groups of people among those who have handed themselves over. One group is the brothers and sisters who have been holding a job in the world for a number of years. The other group is the young brothers and sisters who are still in school and have not touched many of the things of the world yet. A man goes through only a limited number of crises in his lifetime. If he fails to gain something beneficial through these crises, he will stumble and falter before the Lord. We will make some arrangements concerning their future. Our hope is that they will be brought into coordination and that their way ahead will be straight. Tonight we will deal with the items that have been handed over.</p><h2 class="head2">Sister Cheng</h2><p>Sister Cheng is a student. On her consecration slip she consecrated her whole life to the Lord. In the items that were handed over, she included three U.S. dollars and a few dresses. Sister Cheng, you are living with your parents at home. Do they have a problem with your consecration? God does not want us to steal or rob for Him. The heaven, the earth, and everything therein are His. He does not need us to give Him anything. Whatever is in your house that you do not have a full right to dispose of should not be offered to God. Even if you are giving these things to God, He will not take them. Concerning your personal clothing, you should go home and discuss this matter with your parents. You can sell one or two of them and give the money to the poor. You have handed over your belongings to the church. Now the church hands them back to you to be placed under your trust. These things are no longer yours.</p>
