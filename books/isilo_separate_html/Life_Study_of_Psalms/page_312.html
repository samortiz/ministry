The Psalmist's Rejoicing</H2><P>The psalmist rejoiced when others said to him, "Let us go to the house of Jehovah" (v. 1).

In verse 6 he says, "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem./Those who love you will prosper." The "you" refers to Jerusalem. This verse expresses the intimate feeling of the psalmist concerning Jerusalem. Verse 7 indicates that the psalmist is concerned not for his own comfort but for the peace and prosperity of Jerusalem. Thus, in verses 8 and 9 he goes on to say, "For my brothers' and companions' sake I will now say,/Peace be within you./For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God/I will seek your good."</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_311.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_313.html">Next</a> </body></html>
