   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another important verse is 1 Corinthians 6:17, But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are not only one with the Lord, we are one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit, and we have a human spirit purposely created by God that we may take Christ as the life-giving Spirit into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now these two spirits have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Our spirit is one with the Lord, because as the life-giving Spirit He indwells our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Lord in our spirit is not like a drop of oil in water, never mingling with the water.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He mingles with us in our spirit as tea mingles with water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why many times it is difficult to distinguish whether it is we or the Lord doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have some burden, yet it seems the Lord wants to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is because we are one with the Lord in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After tea is put into water, it is difficult to separate the tea from the water.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is why I call it tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is both tea and water.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two mingle as one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same way, the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit mingles with our spirit as one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is in us, and we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It seems that a brother is speaking, but while he is speaking, the Lord is also speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He speaks within that brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His speaking is the brother s speaking, and the brother s speaking is His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, a mingled one is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are really one spirit with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we must come to 2 Timothy 4:22.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most Christians have never realized that there is such a verse in the Bible, telling us that the Lord Jesus is with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The most they have heard is that He is in their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But Christ first of all does not come into our heart, but into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I come to visit you, I do not come into your bedroom first, but into your living room.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord first of all comes into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That is our living room.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our heart is the bedroom, the closet, and all the other rooms.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He will get into all those parts only with our consent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we do not agree, He will never go there.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord that He has come into our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then Romans 8:9-10 tells us that this Christ in our spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The indwelling Christ is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is just the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praise the Lord, they all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By these verses we can see that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is just Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Spirit of God dwells in us, so we have the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then if we have the Spirit of Christ in us, Christ Himself is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This proves that the very Christ that indwells our spirit is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>REVEALED IN US, LIVING IN US, FORMED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul tells us in Galatians 1:15-16 that it pleased God to reveal Christ in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when it pleased God...to reveal his Son in me.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then in chapter two he tells us that Christ lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, the Christ that lives in us must be formed in us: ...until Christ be formed in you Gal 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This can be illustrated by putting a hand into a glove.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Sometimes the hand may be in the glove, but not fully formed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fingers of the hand may not be all the way into the fingers of the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The hand is in the glove, but not in a good shape.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not formed in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Gradually the fingers of the hand get into the fingers of the glove, and finally the hand is fully formed in the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise the Lord that Christ is within us, but He must be formed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Paul travailed that Christ would be formed in the Galatian Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Christ should not only be revealed in us and living in us, but also formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>HOME IN OUR HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ must make his home in your hearts by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>First of all He is in our spirit; then gradually He will spread into every part of our heart until He has fully made His home there.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now He is not only formed, but completely settled in our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is why Paul could say in Philippians 1:21, For me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul says that regardless of what kind of circumstance or situation he is in, for him to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do you realize how much work is needed in us in order to say this?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Yet Paul could say that his living was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then one day the Christ within us will become the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory Col 1:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today Christ is within us as the hope of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But while we are living out Christ, we are waiting for the day when this indwelling Christ will become our outward glory.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We were made with a spirit, a soul, and a body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The parts of the soul are the mind, emotion, and will.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>These three parts combined with the conscience part of the spirit constitute the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have seen that Christ as the life-giving Spirit has come into our spirit; but He needs to spread from our spirit into all the parts of our heart that He may make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is why Paul prays in Ephesians 3:16 that our inner man will be strengthened that Christ may make His home in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The inner man is just our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This part of our being needs to be strengthened that Christ may spread into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>From our spirit He will spread into our mind, our emotion, and our will.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is a gradual work.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It could never be done overnight or even over one year.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Gradually Christ spreads Himself from our spirit into every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This takes much time and much dealing by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>So many of us must confess that although Christ is within us, He does not have much ground within us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have opened our spirit to Him, but we have closed our mind, our emotion, and our will to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the meetings we shout Amen, but when we get home we will not let the Lord touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>However, He does not give up.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Gradually, little by little, we open our inward parts to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is in this way that Christ will make His home in us.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Then our very living will become the manifestation of Christ, and we will be waiting for His coming to become our outward glory.</S>
