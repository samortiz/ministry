   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST'S ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Psalm 68 speaks concerning Christ's ascension v. 18a; Eph 4:8a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. Ascending on High</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 68:18a says, "You have ascended on high."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This refers to the highest peak in the universe cf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isa 14:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>B. Leading Captive Those Taken Captive,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Included in the Train of Vanquished Foes</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we have pointed out, in His ascension Christ led captive those taken captive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we need to see that these ones, the redeemed of Christ, are included in the train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Amplified New Testament renders "He led captive those taken captive" Eph 4:8 as "He led a train of vanquished foes."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Christ's ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes, led as captives from a war, for a celebration of Christ's victory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although, as Colossians 2 indicates, the evil spirits tried to hinder Christ in His ascension, Christ nevertheless ascended to the Father leading a train of vanquished foes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not appear before the Father empty-handed but had a great many vanquished foes following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CHRIST RECEIVING THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Psalm 68:18 also reveals the matter of Christ receiving the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A. Taking the Gifts among Men,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>even the Rebellious Ones</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"You have taken gifts among men,/Even the rebellious ones" v. 18b . When Christ ascended to the Father, He presented to the Father all the ones He had captured and brought with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Father then returned all these captured ones to Christ, making each one of them a gift to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all were held captive by Satan in his prison, but we have been captured by Christ, presented by Christ to the Father, and then given to Christ by the Father as gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although as gifts we may differ in size and quality, we all are gifts given by the Father to the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. The Gifts Becoming the Gifted Believers</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The gifts received by Christ have become the gifted believers, like the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not believe the lie that we are not a gift or that we have not been gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Every saved person is a gifted believer.</S>
