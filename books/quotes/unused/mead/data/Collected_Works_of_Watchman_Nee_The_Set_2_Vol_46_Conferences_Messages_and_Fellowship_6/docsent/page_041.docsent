   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETY-TWO THE FOUR ASPECTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE LORD'S DEATH Scripture Reading: Exo 12:13; Rom 6:6, 11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The imparting of life was not an afterthought on the part of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God did not desire to impart the divine life to man only after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This thought was in His very heart from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even before the fall, God wanted to give His Son to man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's eternal purpose is for there to be a race of beings who can share His uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He offered His life to Adam in the form of the tree of life before sin ever came in. Adam was innocent, being neither sinful nor holy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was a man living by his natural life; he was a living soul.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When sin came in, Adam and God were separated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Adam was afraid of meeting God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was a need for redemption only after sin came in. Before the fall man's need could have been supplied by simply receiving life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But instead of receiving life, he chose something else.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When sin came in, God had to do something in addition to His original purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Redemption is not an end in itself, but it is a necessary means to reach God's end because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The work of the Lord Jesus was twofold: 1 bringing about the purpose of God, and 2 bringing about the redemption of man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The latter aspect was remedial.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The death of the Lord Jesus was not just remedial in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It also included a positive aspect quite apart from the matter of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Remedially, it dealt with what man had brought in, and positively, it carried out the original purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There are four aspects of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Two of these four aspects are for the undoing of the devil's work and man's sin, and two are for the bringing about of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These four aspects include: 1 the blood for remedy, 2 the crucifixion for remedy, 3 the flesh for God's purpose, and 4 the bearing of the cross for God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is man's need?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As soon as disobedience came in, the question of guilt had to be addressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of guilt, God and man became separated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A blockage came between them, and this gives Satan ground for attacking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, there is a need to have that guilt the ground of attack and condemnation removed so that man can be brought back into full fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before Adam sinned, he was a natural man; after the fall he became "the old man."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We not only have "products" on the street, we also have a "factory" of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sins have to be done away with so that there is no case before God, and I the factory which produces the sins also have to be done away with so that there will be no more cases!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, the blood is for sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, the cross is for me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Third, the flesh releases His life into me which was represented by the tree of life .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fourth, the bearing of the cross is the working of death that keeps the natural life or soul-life in its proper place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The blood is toward God, man, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Primarily, the blood is for God, not for man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is required by God, but if we do not realize the value of the blood to God, we will not realize its value to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Old Testament the blood is mentioned over four hundred times, and in each case, it is always for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the day of Atonement the blood was sprinkled before the Lord seven times, and no man except the high priest, typifying the Lord Jesus, was allowed to draw near to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Egypt the blood was smeared on the outside of the door for God to see; those who were in the house could not see it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The life is in the blood, and God requires blood to satisfy His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The blood was God's portion and was never allowed to be eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes we feel our sins are more real than the blood, yet we have to accept God's valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to believe that the blood is precious to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If God accepts it for our redemption, then we can believe that the debt is paid.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First John 1:7 says, "The blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the business world, if I pay a debt, the one to whom I pay the money has to see that the money is good!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If God says the blood is enough to satisfy His requirements, then it must be.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our valuation of the blood must be in accordance with His valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The result will be that our hearts will be purified from an evil conscience Heb 9:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The blood cleanses our conscience, not our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We know how important it is to have a clear conscience, because without this we are unable to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If our conscience condemns us, faith leaks out.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The temptation to many is to think they must live up to what they regard as God's standard before they can come with confidence to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But the blood is the way of access, and our approach is always with boldness because it has nothing to do with our attainment or holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The blood is the only thing that is needed; it is absolutely sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The first time we came to the Lord, we were made near by the blood, and every subsequent time that we come to Him, we are made near by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Penance will not make our approach any easier.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The blood is our only plea.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since our conscience is cleansed before God we have "no more conscience of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From this ground we can face the enemy and all of his efforts to bring us under condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The blood puts God on our side, and we can be fearless.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The fall brought in something which gave Satan some footing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore, man was put outside the garden, and God was outside of man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The blood restores us to God and God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The blood of the Lord Jesus cleanses us not only from sin but from every sin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As He is in the light, we can walk in the light, and the blood will cleanse us from every sin those which we think are unforgivable and even those which we are not conscious of.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is only as our conscience is clear that we can overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His attacks are based on his accusations, and if we accept these accusations we will go down.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why do we come under his accusations and believe them?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is because we still hope to have some righteousness of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We often may be disappointed in ourselves, but God is never disappointed with us because He expects nothing from us!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If we accept God's verdict that no good thing dwells in us, and judge ourselves to be worthy of nothing but death, and if we see that the blood more than pays every time, Satan will have no ground of attack.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Our attitude only will be, "Lord, I cannot hope to be any better, but Your blood is always sufficient."</S>
