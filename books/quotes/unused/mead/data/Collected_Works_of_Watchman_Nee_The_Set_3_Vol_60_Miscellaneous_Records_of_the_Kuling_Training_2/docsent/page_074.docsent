   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO COMINGS OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His first coming, the Lord became flesh and was crucified on the cross for man's sin, giving man the power to overcome sin and to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man receives the power of life, but this power is only half of the story, because he is only delivered from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The life that he has received is a life that delivers, but it does not deal with sin itself; sin itself has not been annihilated.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, we can say that the first coming of the Lord liberates us, that is, we are liberated from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But sin still exists on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In one sense the salvation of the Lord is not yet complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Suppose a man falls into the hands of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ's first coming is likened to deliverance from the hands of such robbers; He delivered us from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the robbers are still there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His second coming He will do away with the "robbers."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Sin will be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The cross is a deliverance in our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His second coming is a deliverance in our outward environment.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first coming of the Lord brought us salvation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The second coming of the Lord will bring us a complete salvation because He will wipe out sin altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A Bible seller in Shanghai said, "Once a man is saved, he will not need to sin."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But another person retorted, saying, "As long as a man remains on this earth, he will sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is like living in a coal mine; everyone in it is black with soot."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first brother answered, "But never forget that the sea water may be salty, but all the fishes in the sea are not; they are fresh."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first coming of the Lord made the "fish" no longer "salty."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His second coming will make the "sea" no longer "salty."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His first coming, the Lord saved us individually one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In His second coming, He will save the world as well.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In His first coming, He dealt with everything related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His second coming, He will deal with the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today all of us who are saved through His first coming have a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When He comes again, we will inherit a new environment to match our new life within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although He gave us a new life in His first coming, our bodies are still mortal; they will still die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But when He comes again, our body will swallow up mortality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His first coming does not remove the weaknesses in our bodies; our bodies still pose limitations to God's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In His second coming, our bodies will be fully redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All weaknesses will be gone, and God's work will be fully accomplished in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today a Christian overcomes many things inwardly, but he is not yet delivered from many environments around him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The outward environment is like Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although Lot was a righteous man, it was a suffering for him to live in Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today sin is our neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more we are delivered from sin, the more we feel the evil of sin around us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord comes again, we will be saved even in our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our body will be saved, and death will not have any power over our body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then there will be no more weakness and no more thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are looking for the Lord's soon return.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Those who are under some kind of oppression are even more eager for His return.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The more we hate sin, the more we cry out for the Lord's return.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>How terrible is the environment around us!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only are sin and death unresolved, even Satan is unresolved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's word shows us that the whole world lies in the wicked one 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His power is still operating in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In His first coming, the Lord gave us the power to overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In His second coming, He will deal with the power of Satan Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He will even deal with the sin in our environment and the death in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are full of joy and thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before that day comes, we have to wait for the Lord to finish that second half of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because of their ignorance of the Lord's work in His second coming, some people have formed wrong concepts about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They think that Christians are only interested in a gospel for individuals, that they are not interested in a gospel for society as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Actually we believe in an individual gospel, and we also believe in a social gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The time for the social gospel will be when the Lord comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today the Lord has not charged us to take care of the society around us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The world tries to change society with science.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But we are changing society with life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can do what the world cannot do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are here to save the souls of those in society.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When the Lord comes the second time, the world will not only be saved inwardly but will be saved outwardly as well.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In His first coming the Lord saved individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In His second coming He will save the entire society.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today Christians are engaged in a spiritual work, while others are engaged in social work.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We do not reform society; we only bring men to God and save them one by one.</S>
