<h2 class="head1">LEARNING RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>We had our entrance through the way of righteousness; this is the way we were saved. The result of this is that as Christians, we should learn righteousness. We cannot be careless in anything. Since God has been righteous in saving us, we do not match God and are not compatible with Him if we are not righteous. Redemption makes us an expression of God's righteousness. What redemption has taught us should be expressed as God's righteousness in our lives. We should live our life on earth as righteous ones. We have to remember that God could not be unrighteous in saving us; He could not be unrighteous toward Himself. His nature is such that He has to be righteous. He cannot perform an unrighteous act or let an unrighteous act go unpunished. Since every saved person, every Christian, is a specimen and an expression of God's righteousness, how can we do anything unrighteous? If the unique supreme God has to be righteous, how much more should we spend our days on earth in righteousness? We can learn one lesson immediately: anything unrighteous does not resemble God, any violation of others' rights does not resemble God, and any neglect of our own duty does not resemble God. We must remember that for the sake of righteousness, God paid a righteous price, the price of His Son. God has sacrificed His Son for the sake of righteousness. Jesus of Nazareth, the crucified One, is God's righteous price. For the sake of righteousness, God paid a great price. Now what should we do? We cannot be unrighteous for fear of paying a price. For a while, it may be convenient and advantageous to compromise. But if we are an unrighteous person, we will eat the fruit of unrighteousness in the end.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, in order to advance in this way, we must first consider how we initially entered this way. In saving us, God did not bring us in through the back door; He welcomed us through the front door. Thank and praise God that we were saved in a respectable way. In bringing us in in this way, God shut up every mouth; He saved us in a righteous way. If God were unrighteous in any way, the devil would have something to say, because he is forever standing on God's opposite side. The devil would say that God saved men unrighteously. We thank the Lord that He prepared a salvation that even shuts the mouth of the devil. God saved us in a way that no one can overturn. First John 1:9 says, "He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness." God saved us according to His righteousness. Hallelujah, this is the way we came in! Since God was not loose and unrighteous in saving us, we should not be loose in anything that we do throughout our life.</p><p>We have to learn the principle of righteousness. What does it mean to be righteous? Being righteous is owing others nothing; it is refusing to take what one does not deserve, and refusing to give what should not be given. To repeat, since God is not unrighteous concerning Himself, we who belong to Him cannot be unrighteous either. We cannot owe anyone anything. Whether or not we can be a proper Christian and grow depends on our view and feeling concerning righteousness at the time we entered the gate. It hurts our heart to see some so-called Christians having no sense of righteousness at all. They never feel that they have done anything unrighteous. Some have not even apologized once to anyone since they became a Christian. Does this mean that they have always been right? There can only be two possibilities as to why they have never apologized. Either they have been right all the time and never been wrong, or they have been wrong and not confessed that they were wrong. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we do not deceive ourselves to think that we are never wrong. May we not put aside confession through the hardening of our heart or the saving of our face.</p><h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH UNRIGHTEOUS THINGS</h2><p>In order to learn righteousness, we have to learn to deal with all the unrighteous things. Before we became a Christian, we might have done many unrighteous things, such as taking advantage of others, deceiving others, or unconsciously taking their possessions as our own. All these are unrighteousnesses. Some might even have done worse. Some have been unrighteous not only in material things, but with respect to the rights of others. Everyone has his own right. If you do not respect the rights of others, you are being unrighteous. Some parents argue with each other all the time. There is no peace between them all year round, and their children are deprived of the peace they deserve. As a result, the parents have trampled the rights of their children under their feet. This is being unrighteous. Some husbands have not fulfilled their duty as husbands. Some wives have not fulfilled their duty as wives. These are also unrighteousnesses. Now that we have become Christians, we should learn to deal with these unrighteous things.</p><p>How well we run the race before us depends on how well we have learned the first lesson. God's redemption tells us that God has saved us in such a righteous way that we can no longer live carelessly on earth; we have to be righteous. At least we should learn this one lesson. Once we know of any unrighteousness, we have to deal with it because all unrighteousnesses are sins. Many people only know pride, jealousy, murder, and arson as sins. They have not seen what unrighteousness is. God has to bring us to the point where we see unrighteouseness item by item. When we find any unrighteousness, we have to deal with it. If we do not deal with our unrighteousness, we cannot express God. When others see us, they will not see God's righteousness and not know what God's righteousness is all about. We must let others see God's righteousness in our daily lives. In the following paragraphs we will consider how to deal with unrighteousness.</p>
