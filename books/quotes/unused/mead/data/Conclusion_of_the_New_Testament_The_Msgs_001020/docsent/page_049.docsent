   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ, who is the embodiment of the infinite God without any limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a great Christ needs the Body, constituted of the many sons of God, for His complete expression.</S>
