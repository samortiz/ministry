   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE NINETY-FIVE THE SPIRIT HIS WORK 10</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the third stage of the Spirit's work in the believers for the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the stage in which the Spirit works in us to keep us in fellowship with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>55.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Partaken Of by Them</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Spirit is partaken of by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hebrews 6:4 indicates that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Holy Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and we are partakers of such a One.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have not only received the Holy Spirit; we are now partakers of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we have the Spirit, we are His partakers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The book of Hebrews was written to show the Jewish believers that the believers in Christ have Him as a wonderful treasure, a treasure that is much more precious than the angels, Moses, Aaron, and the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This treasure is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, in our practical experience Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, Hebrews does not say that we are partakers of the all-inclusive Christ but that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, is also the reaching to us of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without being the Spirit, the Father and the Son could not reach us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reaching of the Triune God is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the reality of the new covenant, which is superior to the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now, in a way that is actual and practical, we are partakers of the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because we partake of this Spirit, we partake of and enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the divine fellowship we partake of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>56.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Being the Fellowship the Participation in the Enjoyment of the Triune God to Them</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eventually, the Spirit is the fellowship, the participation in the enjoyment, of the Triune God to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Actually, this fellowship is a totality of all the aspects of the Spirit's work in the third stage, the stage of maintaining our fellowship with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Among the sixty-six books of the Bible, 2 Corinthians is unique in that it concludes with a blessing: "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all" 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This blessing is composed of attributes of the Triune God: grace, love, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The love of God the Father is the source, the fount, and grace is the flow, the expression, of love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Love is with the Father as the source, and grace is with the Son as the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is a matter of communication, transmission.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, love is the source, grace is the flow, and fellowship is the transmission of the flow with the source.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way we have love, grace, and fellowship as our enjoyment, and we participate in them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second Corinthians 13:14 clearly says that grace is of Christ, love is of God, and fellowship is of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the book of 2 Corinthians emphasizes grace, grace is mentioned first in 13:14.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As presented in 2 Corinthians, grace is actually the Triune God embodied in the Son and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, grace is the Triune God as our life, life supply, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This grace issues out from the Father's love and is transmitted into our being by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit the full enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
