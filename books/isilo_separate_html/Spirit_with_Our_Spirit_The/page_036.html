With the Breath of God</H2><P>Job 32:8 says, "But there is a spirit in man,/And the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding." According to the poetic structure of this verse, the spirit and the breath of God, the Almighty, are in apposition. Thus, the spirit is the breath of God, and the breath of God is the spirit. Job 32:8 shows that God made our spirit with the breath of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As the Lamp of Jehovah</H2><P>Proverbs 20:27 says that the spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah. When God created man, He put a lamp into man. Among all the creatures, only man has an inner lamp. God created a spirit within man as God's lamp, but this lamp does not function. This is why most of the human race is in darkness, without light. One day, however, we were saved by repenting and believing into the Lord Jesus. When we did this, we began to feel that something within us was shining to enlighten us. That was the functioning of our spirit as the lamp of the Lord.</P><P>In ancient times a lamp burned to give forth its light by the oil within it. The oil typifies the Spirit of God (Isa. 61:1). We have our spirit as a lamp and we always have to contact God through this lamp. Then this lamp will be refilled all the time (Eph. 5:18). The light shining in the lamp comes from the oil, the Spirit. Furthermore, when the oil burns in the lamp to shine, the oil has mingled itself with the lamp. When the oil soaks the wick, the oil and the wick become one. Then they burn together. On the one hand, the wick is burning; on the other hand, the oil is burning. Without the wick, the oil could not burn, and without the oil, the wick could not burn. They must be mingled together by soaking. This shows that we can be soaked by God and with God in our spirit, which is the lamp of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. For Us to Worship God</H2><P>Our spirit was created by God as our particular organ for us to worship God&#151; to contact and contain God (John 4:24; 2 Tim. 4:22a). We cannot worship God without contacting Him. To worship God actually is to contact God. John 4:24 says that those who worship God must worship Him in spirit. Then 2 Timothy 4:22a says that the Lord Jesus is with our spirit. How could someone be with our spirit? I can be with you, but I cannot be with you in your spirit. Only the Lord Jesus can be with us in our spirit, because He is the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Our spirit is a container and a recipient of the Lord. Thank the Lord that we have a spirit. First, God created our spirit; second, He regenerated our spirit; third, He strengthens our spirit; and fourth, He refills our spirit.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
