   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Ark</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to 1 Peter 3:20-21, the ark made by Noah and into which he and his family entered is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Genesis 6:14-16 we see that the ark had three stories, that it was made of gopher wood, and that it was pitched within and without with pitch.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The ark s three stories signify the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, in the ark we have a type of the Three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that the Triune God is in Christ, mingled with human nature typified by the wood used in the ark s construction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The ark was made of gopher wood, which is a cypress full of resin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This resinous wood can withstand the attack of water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Scriptures cypress signifies the crucified Christ, who can withstand the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He tasted death, and death could not damage Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ark made of gopher wood passed through the waters, but no damage was incurred.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This signifies the solidness of Christ as the crucified One.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the real gopher wood, the real cypress full of resin and strong to withstand the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The ark made by Noah was pitched within and without with pitch Gen 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Hebrew for pitch has the same root as the Hebrew word for atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The main meaning of this Hebrew word is to cover.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word for the cover of the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat, also comes from this same root.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The entire ark was pitched with atonement.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This indicates that in Christ, who fulfills the type of the ark, we have the full covering of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 7:13 says, In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah s wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Noah and his family could not have been saved outside of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They were saved because they entered into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entering in of Noah and his family into the ark is a type of our entering into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only by entering into Christ can we be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The ark was for the salvation not only of man but also for the salvation of all living creatures Gen 7:13-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to Hebrews 2:9, Christ tasted death on behalf of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This reveals that Christ s redemption was accomplished not only for mankind but for everything created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, Colossians 1:20 says that God has reconciled all things to Himself through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is clearly typified by the redemption of Noah s ark, in which not only eight persons but also the living things created by God were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fact that creatures as well as human beings were in the ark indicates that Christ accomplished an all-inclusive death for every creature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, the ark was not only for the salvation of man but for the salvation of all living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Melchisedec</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Another type of Christ is Melchisedec Gen 14:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Genesis 14:18 says, Melchisedec king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Salem means peace, and Melchisedec means king of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Melchisedec is a type of Christ as God s High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not revealed in Genesis 14, but it is found in Psalm 110, where we are told that God s anointed One, the Christ, is the Priest according to the order of Melchisedec, an order that is prior to that of Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Aaronic priesthood dealt with sin, taking care of things on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ministry of Melchisedec, on the contrary, is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Melchisedec did not appear to Abraham with an offering to take away sin, but with bread and wine to nourish him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Nearly all Christians consider Christ as the High Priest who takes away sin, but few pay attention to Christ as the High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As such a High Priest, Christ does not take away sin, but ministers to us the processed God, signified by the bread and wine, as our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Hebrews 6:20 7:3 we have the fulfillment of the type in Genesis 14:18-20.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Christ is forever a High Priest according to the order of Melchisedec Heb 6:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Christ s purification of sins is typified by the work of Aaron, whereas His sitting down on the right hand of the Majesty on high Heb 1:3 is according to the order of Melchisedec Psa 110:1, 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ s work on the cross typified by the work of Aaron affords us forgiveness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>His ministry on the throne in heaven ministers to us the heavenly supply for the overcoming of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whenever most Christians speak about Christ as our High Priest, they have the concept that He is the High Priest who sacrifices to God for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This, of course, is correct, but it is on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ as the High Priest offering sacrifices to God is typified by Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That was in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today Christ is no longer offering sacrifices for sin; instead, He is ministering the Triune God to us as our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the past Christ offered sacrifices to God for our sins as typified by Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today He is ministering the Triune God to us as our supply according to the order of Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is proved by the coming of Melchisedec to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As the priest of the Most High God, Melchisedec did not offer sacrifices to God for Abraham s sin; he ministered bread and wine to him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As indicated by the symbols of the Lord s table, in the Bible bread and wine signify the processed God as our supply.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our High Priest, Christ, is not according to the order of Aaron offering sacrifices to God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is according to the order of Melchisedec ministering the processed God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Melchisedec was a king, and his name means king of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Isaiah 32:1 this title refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Christ is the King of righteousness, today s Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As the King of righteousness Christ has made all things right with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He has reconciled us to God and has appeased God for us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Righteousness issues in peace Isa 32:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>By His righteousness Christ has brought forth the fruit of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Melchisedec is also the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, signifying that Christ is also the King of peace Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As the King of peace through righteousness, Christ has brought in peace between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In peace He fulfills the ministry of His priesthood, ministering God to us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>According to the type in Genesis 14, after Melchisedec, the king of righteousness and the king of peace, came, there was righteousness and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In such an environment and condition of righteousness and peace Melchisedec ministered the bread and wine to the victor.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This portrays the ministry of Christ, our kingly High Priest.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Our kingly High Priest is perpetual, eternal, without beginning or ending.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hebrews 7:3 says of Melchisedec that he is without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, abides a priest perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because our Melchisedec is eternal, He has no genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This also is a fulfillment of the type in Genesis 14.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>For all the important persons in Genesis there is a genealogy, but not for Melchisedec.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the divine writing the Holy Spirit sovereignly gave no account of the beginning of his days or of the end of his life so that he might be a proper type of Christ as the eternal One to be our High Priest perpetually.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is like the presentation in the Gospel of John of the Son of God, who, being eternal, has no genealogy John 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But as the Son of Man Christ has a genealogy Matt 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is such a Christ who is the High Priest ministering the processed God to us as our daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He is the perpetual One, the constant One, the eternal One, having no beginning of days nor end of life.</S>
