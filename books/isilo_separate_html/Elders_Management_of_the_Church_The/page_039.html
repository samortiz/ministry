Authority in Catholicism is something abnormal. As a result of this, those who belong to God have a very bad impression concerning this matter. They think that there should not be any authority among God's children. To them, once authority comes in, there is Catholicism, and it becomes organized Christianity. God's children are greatly affected because of the background of the abnormal concept of authority in both Catholicism and Protestantism. They regard authority with considerable misunderstanding and contempt. Nevertheless, brothers, we have to admit before the Lord that as long as there is a church, there is the need for administration, and, as long as there is administration, there is the need for authority. Whether the authority is exercised normally or abnormally is a different matter. The need for authority is the main issue. Therefore, unless we ignore the administration of the church altogether, it is impossible to neglect the question of authority or to despise it.</P><P>Please forgive me for saying that when I was a young Christian, I too somewhat had the thought that the question of authority should not be brought up among God's children. I thought that in Matthew 20 the Lord has clearly told us that among the Gentiles there are rulers and officials, but among us it should not be so because we are brothers. This is right in one sense. However, we must admit that there are two sides to all truths in the Scriptures and that the two sides balance each other. At the beginning, we thought that authority could be dispensed with altogether, because the matter was so abnormal in Catholicism and Protestantism. From the Bible, we also found the Lord's words that we are all brothers; no one should rule over you, and no one should rule over me. If anyone is to rule over us, it can only be the Lord Himself. Who can be a substitute for the Lord in ruling over others? Whoever wants to rule violates the lordship of the Lord and usurps His position. This is really a blasphemy to the Lord. Such a statement has its point, and it is not altogether wrong, but we need to see the other side. Gradually, due to our love for the Lord, we realized more of the spiritual life and saw the light concerning the church and the Body of Christ. Then we saw that if you and I are merely brothers, there may be no need of authority, but we are also members one of another in His Body. Thus, the question of coordination is brought in. Of course, I do not mean that with the brothers there is no need of authority. Gradually, you will realize that even as brothers there is the need of authority. However, the most obvious place where authority is required is in the mutual coordination of the members in His Body. This is a corporate matter, a church matter. In the church there must be authority. Once we pay attention to the matter of the church, we have no choice but to face the issue of administration. Once administration is brought in, we have to confront the practical problems.</P><P>I still remember clearly that thirty years ago a group of us in North China was raised up; we cast away organized Christianity and came together to meet. When we first came together, we said, "We are all brothers. Only the Lord is our Head. We do not want man to rule over us." Gradually, however, practical issues arose. For example, how should we arrange the chairs for the meeting? The brothers insisted to do it one way, and the sisters insisted on another way. With a few brothers and sisters there were a few different ways of arrangement. How were we to solve the problem? If we were to use the democratic way, we could first have everyone express his opinion and then have everyone vote by the raising of hands; if the number were in the majority, the resolution would be passed. However, not only is there no such example in the Bible; even we ourselves did not have the peace and assurance within. Here was a practical problem which we could not deny.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
