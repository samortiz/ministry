   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD Being Girded with Truth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most of the items of the divine armor of God in Ephesians 6 are for protection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we must gird our loins with truth v. 14a . Truth here does not refer to the doctrine of the word of God, because the word is related to the sword in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Truth refers to faithfulness, sincerity, and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we practice the church life, we must be real.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I must be real to you, and you must be real to me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There must be no falsehood and no pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have pretense and falsehood, we do not have truth among us; that is, we are not real.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A Chinese proverb says, "To have a pretense is to stand on melting ice."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church life, everything we do and speak must be real.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Otherwise, we should not do it or speak it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we love a brother, we should love in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not love, we should not love in pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To pretend to love without real love is false.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This causes us to lose the ground to fight the battle because the evil spirits will attack our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The evil spirits know where we are, what we are, and what is in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we must be real, not only before God but also before the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then we will have the ground to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 14 speaks of being girded with truth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To be girded is to be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not have truth, but rather everything in the church is false, we lose our girding up, and we can never be strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A soldier must be girded up in order to be strong to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we do not have truth but are pretending and false, not speaking real things or doing real things, we are finished; we cannot fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to maintain truth, sincerity, faithfulness, and reality among the saints, we must do everything in a real way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must do nothing in a pretending way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must hate pretense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am sorry for the situation among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even some of the spiritual persons play politics.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may speak well to a brother, but an hour later they may speak evilly about him to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is politics.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we want to realize the church by the grace and mercy of God, we must speak truthfully and faithfully to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may say to one, "Brother, in this matter I do not agree with you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I feel you are wrong."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, we must say this in the spirit and not in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we are not able to say it in the spirit, we should not say it at all, but we should not pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not tell a brother that nothing is wrong and then turn around and say something different to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It makes the church false and not real.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then the church loses the ground to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are defeated already if we speak lies to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you pretend to love me, and I pretend to be nice to you, we have already been defeated by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How then can we fight the battle?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must be sincere to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we realize that a brother is unable to receive a word from us at the present time, or if we do not feel that we are fully in the spirit, we should not say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not play politics; do not be political among the Lord's children.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of course, we should not lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not be angry with people, but we should be genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Breastplate of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We also need the breastplate of righteousness v. 14b . We must be righteous; we cannot be unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we lose our righteousness, we lose the ground to fight the spiritual battle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we lie to one another, for example, there is falsehood and unrighteousness among us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Righteousness must be maintained among the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Otherwise, the enemy will take the unrighteousness in the church as the weak point to attack.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is why we must deal with all unrighteous things in order to maintain the righteousness in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we do not have righteousness, we do not have protection for our breast.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This has much to do with the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need righteousness as a breastplate to protect our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do not have righteousness as a covering, there will be attacks on our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Being Shod with the Gospel of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 15 speaks of having our feet shod with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here the gospel is likened to a pair of shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we walk, we touch the earth, and there are many things that can make our feet dirty or hurt them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, we need a pair of good shoes to protect our feet from being dirtied and hurt by the touch with the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What are the Christian's shoes?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Christian's shoes are the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The gospel is a good pair of shoes to protect our Christian "feet" from being dirtied and hurt by the earthly touch.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we need to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Wherever we go, we should tell people that we are Christians and that they must believe into Christ Jesus as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we do this, we will be protected.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We must have some outreach through gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is a protection to us.</S>
