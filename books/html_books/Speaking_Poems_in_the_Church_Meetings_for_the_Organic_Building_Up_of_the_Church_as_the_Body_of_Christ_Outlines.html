<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>Today the Lord is recovering the organic building up of the Body of Christ. The contents of the outlines in this book are from the writings of Brother Witness Lee that have been published during the past four years. The outlines cover the matter of speaking poems&mdash;psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs&mdash;in the meetings of the church for the organic building up of the church as the Body of Christ. Our desire is that the Lord would use these outlines to help perfect the saints unto the work of the ministry, equipping them to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal economy to build up the Body of Christ.</p>

OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-21; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The scriptural revelation concerning speaking poems (psalms are long poems, hymns are shorter ones, and spiritual songs are the shortest).
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs&rdquo;&mdash;Eph. 5:18-19.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs&rdquo;&mdash;Col. 3:16.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm...Let all things be done for building up&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26.</li>
	<li>Ephesians 5:19; Colossians 3:16; and 1 Corinthians 14:26 reveal that psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs are firstly for speaking, not mainly for singing.</li>
	<li>Paul&rsquo;s letters to the churches in Ephesus, Colosse, and Corinth reveal that speaking poems in the church meetings is exceedingly profitable.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord&rsquo;s charge through Paul concerning speaking poems was emphasized three times in the New Testament.</li>
		<li>This charge was written to four churches&mdash;the church in Corinth (1 Cor. 1:2), the church in Ephesus (Eph. 1:1), and the church in Colosse (Col. 1:2), plus the church in Laodicea (Col. 4:16).</li>
		<li>The charge was directed to churches in both continents, Asia and Europe, where Paul labored.</li>
		<li>In 1 Corinthians 4:17 Paul said, &ldquo;As I teach everywhere in every church.&rdquo;
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>These words show that Paul taught the same thing in all the churches.</li>
			<li>His words in this verse further reveal that the apostle&rsquo;s teaching is the same universally and does not vary from church to church.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>1 Corinthians 14:26 indicates that the first words spoken in a meeting are usually a hymn; it is the first item covered by Paul, indicating its importance in the meetings of the church.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We all should speak in the meetings of the church.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>But many of us may not know what to speak.</li>
	<li>The poems in our hymnal, <em>Hymns,</em> supply us with material to speak.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The poems provide us the riches of Christ to speak.</li>
		<li>The poems give all the saints a way to speak Christ to God and to speak Christ to one another.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>All the attendants in the meeting should speak the poems in mutuality:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Speaking to <em>one another&rdquo;</em>&mdash;Eph. 5:19.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Teaching and admonishing <em>one another&rdquo;</em>&mdash;Col. 3:16.</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Exhorting <em>one another&rdquo;</em>&mdash;Heb. 10:25.</li>
	<li>When a proper poem is spoken in the church meetings, all speak <em>one by one</em> to <em>one another</em> a high, complete, and full revelation.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 5:18-21 says, &ldquo;...be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father; being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.&rdquo;
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Verses 19-21 modify &ldquo;be filled in spirit&rdquo; in verse 18.</li>
	<li>To be filled in spirit with Christ causes the believers to overflow with Him in speaking, singing, psalming, and giving thanks to God and in submitting themselves to one another.</li>
	<li>Speaking, singing, psalming, giving thanks to God, and subjecting ourselves to one another are not only the outflow of being filled in spirit but also the way to be filled in spirit.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Colossians 3:16 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.&rdquo;
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>&ldquo;Teaching and admonishing&rdquo; and &ldquo;singing&rdquo; all modify the verb &ldquo;dwell.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>This indicates that the way to let the Lord&rsquo;s word dwell in us richly is by teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in our hearts to God.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Ephesians 5:18 speaks of being filled in spirit and Colossians 3:16 speaks of the word of Christ dwelling in the believers richly.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When we are filled in our spirit with the dispensing Triune God, we speak to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is a speaking by our being filled in spirit.</li>
		<li>It is an infilling of spiritual life that is related to the Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When the word of Christ dwells in us richly, in all wisdom we can teach and admonish one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It is a speaking by the word of Christ dwelling in us richly.</li>
		<li>It is an infilling of spiritual life that is related to the Word.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>This indicates that the Spirit and the Word are identical (John 6:63b).</li>
	</ol></li>

OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-19; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:23a, 26; Heb. 10:24-25</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="7">
<li>The characteristics of proper poems:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>They are written according to the divine revelation.</li>
	<li>They are written to express genuine spiritual experiences.</li>
	<li>Through our speaking they dispense the divine life and illuminate with the divine light.</li>
	<li>They are the cream of a person&rsquo;s:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Spiritual experience.</li>
		<li>Learning.</li>
		<li>Thought.</li>
		<li>Utterance.</li>
		<li>Writing.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To speak the composed, poetic writings is more accurate, concise, and powerful than ordinary speaking.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>When we speak the hymns one to another with the exercise of our spirit,
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Every sentence uttered by us touches the being of others.</li>
	<li>Every sentence we speak ministers Christ into others&rsquo; being.</li>
	<li>It does not build up a congregation, but it builds up the organic Body of Christ.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The issue of speaking psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs in mutuality, one to another, in the church meetings.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The word of Christ is ministered&mdash;Col. 3:16.</li>
	<li>The Spirit is dispensed&mdash;Eph. 5:18-19.</li>
	<li>The Body of Christ is built up&mdash;1 Cor. 14:26.</li>
	<li>Teaching and admonishing are realized&mdash;Col. 3:16.</li>
	<li>Exhortation results&mdash;Heb. 10:25.</li>
	<li>Truths for enlightenment are revealed.</li>
	<li>Life for supply is imparted.</li>
	<li>Experiences of the Triune God are unveiled.</li>
	<li>God is manifested.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>By speaking poems in the church meetings, the meetings will be uplifted, strengthened, supplied, enriched, enlivened, and refreshed.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The speaking of the hymns works best in the group meetings with a smaller number&mdash;Heb. 10:24-25.</li>
	<li>However, we should learn and practice speaking the hymns in the larger meetings of the church for the mutual edification of the saints and the building up of the church&mdash;1 Cor. 14:23a, 26.</li>
	<li>In every church meeting it is good and profitable to use a proper hymn in a living way.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Necessary points to care for in speaking psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Exercise to have your whole being in full harmony with the Lord:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A sober, clear mind.</li>
		<li>A calm emotion.</li>
		<li>An exercised spirit.</li>
		<li>A heart free from all condemnation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Overcome the two things that damage the meetings and the Lord&rsquo;s recovery:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Our face.</li>
		<li>Our pride.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Speak out of the enjoyment of Christ.</li>
	<li>Speak to dispense God into people.</li>
	<li>Release your spirit&mdash;our spirit must be open, strong, real, genuine, and released, not weak, timid, false, or closed.</li>
	<li>Be living and impressive in your speaking.</li>
	<li>Speak to impress people with the points of the hymn.</li>
	<li>Digest the portion spoken thoroughly.</li>
	<li>Speak without anything religious or natural.</li>
	<li>Speak without any routine, without anything traditional, and without any oldness.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Speak in a living and flowing manner with flexibility.</li>
		<li>A river flows straight and crooked, fast and slow, gentle and rough, and quiet and loud.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>In developing our exercise in speaking to one another in psalms, hymns and spiritual songs:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We must be poor in spirit.</li>
	<li>We must have a learning attitude.</li>
	<li>We must be sincere in our exercise.</li>
	<li>We will spontaneously adjust our practice as we corporately exercise ourselves in the speaking of the poems.</li>
	</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">SPEAKING POEMS<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="13">
<li>For the greatest profit in speaking poems in the church meetings, we must be familiar with the crucial poems in our hymnal, <em>Hymns,</em> that contain the rich speaking forth of the divine truths, i.e. the apostles&rsquo; teaching.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>If we want to know the hymnal, we must spend time in the table of contents and discover the riches.</li>
	<li>We have to praise the Lord that we have a Bible and also a hymnal with poems composed according to the truths of the Bible.</li>
	<li>There are hundreds of poems in our hymnal that contain vital points:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The blessing, worship, and experience of the Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit.</li>
		<li>The filling of the Spirit&mdash;inward and outward.</li>
		<li>The identification with Christ.</li>
		<li>The experience of Christ.</li>
		<li>The experience of the cross and the resurrection life.</li>
		<li>The various aspects of the inner life.</li>
		<li>Prayer and service.</li>
		<li>The church and the kingdom.</li>
		<li>The assurance of salvation.</li>
		<li>Consecration.</li>
		<li>Comfort in trials and encouragement.</li>
		<li>Spiritual warfare.</li>
		<li>The gospel.</li>
		<li>The meetings.</li>
		<li>The hope of glory.</li>
		<li>The ultimate manifestation.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Concerning the poems that we may speak in the church meetings:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>We should know the crucial points of the contents of the hymns.</li>
	<li>We should care for the standard of the hymns:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We can know the standard by sensing the hymns.
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The sensation of a hymn is based upon the thought in the hymn.</li>
			<li>The sensation of a hymn also refers to its taste.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Two examples of the standard of the hymns are as follows:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>Hymns,</em> #19 (not so full of revelation, low) and #18 (full of revelation, high).</li>
			<li><em>Hymns,</em> #70 (low in life, truth, experience, and revelation), #154 (a higher standard), and #152 (the highest standard).</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We should discern the wording of the hymns.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>A hymn must have the proper thought.</li>
		<li>A hymn must have the proper poetic wording to take care of the rhyme and rhythm.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>We should know the tune of the hymns; many good hymns can be killed by a poor melody.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The practice of speaking the poems (see XI):
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Take the words of the hymn as your own words and speak them forth.</li>
	<li>Function in coordination with the other saints in speaking the hymn to release a full message in mutuality.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Each hymn may be considered as a message.</li>
		<li>Many persons speaking the same hymn speak a complete message for the meeting.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Function as a player on the same team playing with one ball (the poem being spoken).</li>
	<li>Keep a good continuation.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Speak so that others can &ldquo;catch&rdquo; the &ldquo;ball.&rdquo;</li>
		<li>Speak with complete clauses, phrases, or expressions so that others can follow.</li>
		<li>Take care of the proper connection.
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Keep a good sequence.</li>
			<li>Connect the points in the poem.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Speak in order (without discord or confusion).
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Do not overlap others&rsquo; speaking.</li>
			<li>Exercise to listen to others&rsquo; speaking as well as caring for your own.</li>
			<li>Wait on others.</li>
			<li>Do not &ldquo;fight&rdquo; with one another for an opportunity to speak.</li>
			<li>Speak with one voice.
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Speaking by yourself.</li>
				<li>2) Speaking with others.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Refrain from scattered speaking.</li>
			<li>The more clear the speaking is, the more beautiful it is.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Speak in a conversational manner without formality.</li>
	<li>Speak in an informal way&mdash;free but not wild.</li>
	<li>Speak by repeating and stressing the crucial words, phrases, and clauses.</li>
	<li>Speak with different lengths.</li>
	<li>Use the poem to speak a fresh utterance.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Reading is more according to the letter.</li>
		<li>Speaking may or may not be according to the letter and is free, automatic, and spontaneous.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Look at each other when you speak; do not concentrate on your hymn book.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>&ldquo;John, &lsquo;Did you know....&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Sue, &lsquo;Our Christ is....&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
		<li>&ldquo;Brothers, &lsquo;May we all run the race!&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Pay full attention to the way of speaking:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Not too low without loving the saints&rsquo; ears.</li>
		<li>Not too loud to hurt the saints&rsquo; ears.</li>
		<li>Not too slow to exhaust the saints&rsquo; patience.</li>
		<li>Not too fast to puzzle the saints.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Do not do anything to distract others from the flow of the hymn.</li>
	<li>Do everything in a living way, not in a legal way.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Legality brings in death and deadness; we must stay away from the legal deadness.</li>
		<li>We should try to do everything in a very living way that is flexible and applicable.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Practice staying away from routine, deadness, oldness, and tradition.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Consider the following illustrations:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>Speak a whole hymn individually or corporately, and then sing it individually or corporately (maybe sing or speak the entire hymn again).</li>
			<li>Speak a verse of a hymn individually or corporately, and then sing the verse individually or corporately (maybe speak or sing the verse again before going to the next verse of the hymn).</li>
			<li>Sing a hymn individually or corporately, and then speak it individually or corporately.</li>
			<li>Sing a verse individually or corporately, and then speak it individually or corporately.</li>
			<li>Speak and sing only one verse of a hymn.</li>
			<li>Speak and sing only a few verses of a hymn.</li>
			<li>Sisters speak a verse.</li>
			<li>Brothers sing a verse.</li>
			<li>One saint speaks one line, the rest of the brothers and sisters speak the second line, etc. Alternate to speak the whole poem.</li>
			<li>Proclaim individually or corporately a part of a hymn or the whole hymn as an enlightening message.</li>
			<li>Etc., etc., etc.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>There are at least one hundred ways to speak a hymn.</li>
		<li>Learn not to be redundant&mdash;speaking the poetry the same way time after time.</li>
		<li>Learn to also keep the freshness in your speaking by the continuous exercise of your spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As in the Psalms, have a Selah sometimes while speaking the poem.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Offer a prayer.</li>
		<li>Speak something briefly from the Word.</li>
		<li>Explain a little.</li>
		<li>Share a short testimony.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Be free in your spirit to speak, &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hallelujah&rdquo;&mdash;1 Cor. 14:16.</li>
	<li>Give a conclusion to the poem sometimes.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Stress some of the main points of the poem.</li>
		<li>Sum up the entire poem.</li>
		<li>Give a testimony of your experience regarding the content of the poem.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>

<h1 class="title">SPEAKING POEMS<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16; 1 Tim. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:15b; Psa. 95:1; 100:1; Rev. 2:6</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="16">
<li>We believe the psalms (long poems), hymns (shorter poems), and spiritual songs (the shortest poems) spoken by the early saints in the meetings when the church came together were not just the old psalms of the Old Testament but even more the new psalms, hymns, and songs that the saints composed according to the teaching of the apostles.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>When the saints met together, they used the psalms, hymns, and songs very much.</li>
	<li>First Timothy 3:16 was probably a quotation of a short song that was popular in the apostles&rsquo; time.</li>
	<li>When we speak the proper hymns written according to the teaching of the apostles, we will taste and see the riches of Christ in them.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>We should not take the way of the clergy-laity system; rather, we must overthrow this system that produces a hierarchy.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In this system the so-called laymen do not know how to speak; only the clergymen who have studied theology and learned to speak are the ones who speak.</li>
	<li>Everyone can speak in the meetings of the church by speaking the hymns according to what has been presented; we overthrow the clergy-laity system by exercising our spirit to speak (Rev. 2:6).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Although we will speak the spiritual poems to one another in the meetings of the church, we should still sing the psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs.
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The New Testament tells us that we should sing&mdash;Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16; 1 Cor. 14:15b.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Both Ephesians 5 and Colossians 3 say that when we are filled within, we will be full of grace to sing with our hearts, to speak to one another, and to praise the Lord.</li>
		<li>According to 1 Corinthians 14, we should sing out our feeling in the spirit.</li>
		<li>Our singing should be full of the Lord, full of the spirit, and full of life.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The Psalms in the Old Testament tell us to make a joyful noise to the Lord&mdash;Psa. 95:1; 100:1.</li>
	<li>The reasons the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the meetings when the whole church comes together are not that living is because first there is a lack of all speaking and second a lack of singing.</li>
	<li>We may not be an accomplished singer, yet we should still enjoy singing to the Lord.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The Lord enjoys the singing of all the saints.</li>
		<li>The Lord does not care for the proper melody, but He likes to hear a joyful noise full of praises to Him.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we sing in the spirit and with the spirit and with Christ as the content, this is pleasing to God even though we cannot carry a tune; this kind of singing is sweet to the Triune God.</li>
	<li>Whenever we have some free time at home, we should sing the hymns.
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We should sing the hymns until we know them well.</li>
		<li>In this way it will be easy for us to sing hymns in the meetings.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Singing is an outstanding trait of a Christian.</li>
	</ol></li>
