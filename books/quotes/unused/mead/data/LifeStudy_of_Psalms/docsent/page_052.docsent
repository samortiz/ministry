   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Psalm 16, on the other hand, is a psalm revealing the God-man, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 16:1 does not say, "Preserve Me, O God, for I keep the law, and I meditate in the law day and night."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 16:1 says, "Preserve Me, O God, for I take refuge in You."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was as if the psalmist said, "I don't care for the law; I care for You and I enjoy You."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then Psalm 16:2 continues, "O My soul, you say to Jehovah, You are My Lord;/No good have I beyond You."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the Lord Jesus was a man on this earth, He always held such an attitude of recognizing God the Father as His Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His attitude toward the Father could have been expressed by His saying, "I do not have anything beyond You which is good.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have no blessing, no pleasure, and no enjoyment other than You."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 3 says, "To the saints who are on the earth and to the excellent,/All My delight is in them."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus loved God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He also had His delight in the saints, in the believers, in the members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not delight in the commandments of the law, but in the members of His Body, the saints in God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 4 says, "Sorrows will be multiplied to them who bartered for some other god;/Their drink offerings of blood I will not offer,/Nor will I take up their names upon My lips."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their names refers to the names of the idols, the names of the other gods.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 5 says, "Jehovah is the portion of My inheritance and of My cup;/You maintain My lot."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God is the portion of two things: of the inheritance and of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The inheritance refers to the substance of the lot, and the cup refers to the enjoyment of God as our blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the Lord's table, we drink the cup of blessing 1 Cor 10:16a .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Stanza 3 of Hymns, #223 points out that in this cup God is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, we have God as the portion for our inheritance and for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God the Father was the very portion of these two things to Christ as a man on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 5b says, "You maintain My lot."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The lot is the portion of the inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 6a says, "The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for Me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To understand this verse, we have to read Psalm 2:8, which says that God will give to Christ the nations as His inheritance and the limits of the earth as His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The limits are the measuring lines of God in His divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has measured the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whatever God has measured will be Christ's possession.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The measuring lines have fallen on pleasant places for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the whole earth is not a pleasant place, not a place of pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though people are trying to have their amusements, that is not the real pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The earth today is a messy earth, not a pleasant earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Genesis 2 the earth was a pleasant garden, but after the fall of man, this pleasant garden became a messy earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when the earth will be measured and given to Christ, it will become a pleasant earth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 6b says, "Indeed the inheritance is beautiful to Me."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the nations with the earth will be not only pleasant but also beautiful to Christ as the man who inherited God's inheritance.</S>
