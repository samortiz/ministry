<h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION OF THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL</h2><p>Unfortunately, the actual condition of Israel was very poor. If we read the long record in Ezekiel from chapter two to chapter twenty-four, we may feel like weeping over Israel&rsquo;s pitiful condition.</p><h2 class="head2">A Rebellious House</h2><p>The people of Israel were God&rsquo;s elect, but they became rebels against God. Many times in these twenty-three chapters God said that Israel was a rebellious nation, a rebellious house. In 2:3 the Lord said to Ezekiel, &ldquo;Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me.&rdquo; In verses 5 and 6 God referred to them as &ldquo;a rebellious house,&rdquo; and in verse 7 He said that &ldquo;they are most rebellious.&rdquo; They were God&rsquo;s elect, but they had become rebels against God.</p><h2 class="head2">Briars and Thorns</h2><p>The people of Israel were God&rsquo;s vine, but they became briars and thorns (2:6). A vine should produce grapes as fruit to eat and for making wine. Instead of producing grapes, Israel became briars and thorns. They became a pricking, injuring, and damaging plant which yielded no fruit and no wine. God&rsquo;s elect became rebels, and God&rsquo;s vine became briars and thorns.</p><h2 class="head1">A Harlot</h2><p>Moreover, although the people of Israel were God&rsquo;s bride, they became a harlot. They had a &ldquo;whorish heart&rdquo; and they went &ldquo;a whoring after their idols&rdquo; (6:9). What a miserable situation! In chapters sixteen and twenty-three God said that His heart was broken because of their whorish heart. As a dear Husband, God was grieved because His people had become a whorish wife.</p><h2 class="head2">Scorpions</h2><p>According to the record in Ezekiel, what became of Israel as God&rsquo;s flock? In 2:6 we see that God&rsquo;s flock became scorpions. As God&rsquo;s flock they should have been sheep producing meat to nourish people and wool to warm people. But they became scorpions, and with scorpions there is no producing, only stinging.</p><h2 class="head2">Dross</h2><p>Ezekiel 22:18 says, &ldquo;Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.&rdquo; This reveals that Israel, God&rsquo;s precious treasure, had become dross, the waste material that remains after gold and silver have been refined. As God&rsquo;s elect, they became rebels; as God&rsquo;s vine, they became briars and thorns; as God&rsquo;s bride, they became a harlot; as God&rsquo;s flock, they became scorpions; and as God&rsquo;s treasure of gold and silver, they became dross.</p><p>This picture of Israel can be applied to the situation of today&rsquo;s Christianity. In their standing Christians are God&rsquo;s elect, but many have become rebels against God. Instead of being a vine, they have become briars and thorns. Instead of being a wife, they have become a harlot. According to Revelation 17 and 18 today&rsquo;s Christianity is not a bride but a great harlot with many daughter harlots. Thus, today&rsquo;s Christianity is altogether a whoredom. Moreover, among Christians what we see today is not a flock producing meat and wool for others but stinging scorpions. Finally, although some Christians today may be a treasure to God, most have become dross.</p>
