   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING THE PROCESSED GOD AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God the Father is in the Son John 14:11 , and the Son as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The last Adam, who was the Son with the Father John 16:32 , became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, what we need to do is simply to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, We...were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We drink of the Spirit by calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we use our mouth with our spirit to call on the Lord, the Spirit is dispensed into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit whom we receive is Christ 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as the watermelon juice is the essence of watermelon slices, the Spirit is the essence of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we exercise our spirit to call on Him, Christ as the Spirit is dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Assimilating Christ into Our Being for Christ</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>to Make His Home in Our Heart</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ as the Spirit is dispensed into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For our body, God created a stomach to receive what we eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we drink juice, we take the juice into our stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the juice does not remain there but is digested and assimilated into all our cells to constitute the organic tissue of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This reveals that what we eat and drink eventually becomes what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our spirit is our spiritual stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We receive Christ as our spiritual food and drink into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this organ, Christ is assimilated into all our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is already in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 , but we need to allow Him to spread from our spirit into our heart so that He can settle down in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is Christ s making His home in our heart Eph 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Spiritual Growth Being the Increase of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>in Us through the Metabolic Change</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By our drinking the Spirit and allowing Christ to make His home in our heart, Christ dispenses Himself into all our being.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we experience growth by the increase of Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>True growth always comes from the increase, and the increase always comes from the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After being dispensed into us, Christ immediately becomes our nourishment, and we have the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this increase we will grow with Christ and into Christ 4:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is dispensed into us, and we grow into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a mutual mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, all the rich elements of Christ will be wrought into our being, and our negative elements will be discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is transformation, a metabolic change in which something new is brought in to replace something old, which is discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>How wonderful that there is such a metabolism taking place in our being day by day!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we drink the Spirit by calling on the Lord and eat the Lord by pray-reading the Word, Christ as the life-giving Spirit and the living Word is dispensed into our spirit and gradually assimilated into all our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the adding of a new element.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This flow within us will simultaneously discharge every negative element.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The change we experience is not an outward correction but an inward metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This change is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>TRANSFORMATION ISSUING IN BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more we are transformed in this way, the more we will desire to be with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are not transformed, we may be happy to stay home and be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, if we are being transformed, we will spontaneously have an appetite to go to the meetings and fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Building is to put on the new man v. 24 . According to Ephesians 2:15, the new man is a corporate entity composed of two peoples the Jews and the Gentiles and was created by Christ through His work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are putting on the new man by putting on the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In other words, we are being built together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is our experience of the corporate Christ, the Body-Christ, and our foretaste of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE CHURCH LIFE TODAY BEING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF THE CORPORATE CHRIST AND THE BUILDING OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Jews know God as the Creator, the fundamental Christians know God as the Redeemer, and the inner-life people know that Christ is our inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We too know God in all these ways, but today by the Lord s grace we have been brought on to enjoy Christ as the Body-Christ in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is our building, our recovery, and our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is this recovery that will bring the Lord back.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is coming, and we are going forth to meet Him Matt 25:1, 6 not in an individualistic way but in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through the building in the church life, we will eventually have a jasper wall, clear as crystal and expressing God s image Rev 21:11, 18; 4:3 , a city of pure gold with a street of pure gold 21:18, 21b , and gates that are pearls v. 21a . The gold, the precious stones, and the pearls are all here in the church life.</S>
