   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>P. As the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Supplying Us with His Bountiful Supply</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The all-inclusive Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, supplying us with His bountiful supply that we may magnify Christ by living Him Phil 1:19b-21a .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Quite early in my Christian life I was told that I should live out Christ and magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, I did not have the way to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Philippians 1:20 speaks of magnifying Christ, and verse 21 mentions the matter of living Christ, but I did not see that the way to live and magnify Christ is found in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not mention the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Surely this is the processed Spirit, the compounded and consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Spirit of God has become the Spirit of Jesus Christ because God the Spirit has been processed and has been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With this Spirit there is a bountiful supply, and the bountiful supply of this Spirit is the way for us to magnify Christ by living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Spirit's supplying is undoubtedly a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The bountiful supply is dispensed into our Christian life, and then we magnify Christ by living Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Q. As the Indwelling Spirit, Strengthening Us through the Divine Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>into the Inner Man</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The life-giving Spirit, the compound Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, is the indwelling Spirit, strengthening us through the divine dispensing into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, that we may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the breadth, length, height, and depth, that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God, which is the church Eph 3:16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Ephesians 3:16 Paul prayed that God would strengthen us through His Spirit into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To live in the outer man does not require us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every morning when we rise up we are in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we are not watchful, we will be in the outer man the whole day.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We talk in the outer man, we laugh in the outer man, we express our attitude in the outer man we do everything in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are just an outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But we should live in the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, this can take place only by our entering into our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Ephesians 3:16, the way to enter into the inner man is by the strengthening of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit strengthens us into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we have morning watch and experience a morning revival, we are in the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Before that time we might have wanted to argue with someone in the outer man; but after ten minutes we were in the inner man by being strengthened through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, ten minutes later we might be back in the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that point we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is why the Bible tells us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only prayer and calling on the name of the Lord can strengthen us into the inner man and keep us in the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of strengthening is also a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It dispenses the divine element into our being and strengthens us into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is in our spirit, but He needs to spread from our spirit into our hearts to make His home there that we may be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints the breadth and length and height and depth, that is, the dimensions of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to know this unlimited Christ that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The fullness here simply means the manifestation, the expression, of God, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When Christ makes His home in our hearts, we will be able to know His dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is altogether by the inner dispensing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First the Spirit strengthens us into the inner man; then the Spirit strengthens us so that Christ may make His home in our being, making us the expression of God, that God may be fully expressed.</S>
