   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Divisions Being Produced by Keeping the Church in the Hands of the Workers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The more gift a person has and the bigger the gift is, the more danger there is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He will be tempted by the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He may think he can do everything, so it will be difficult for him to trust others to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to stress this because we have learned from the past.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some of the local churches in the Far East have the proper practice.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can see persons produced there all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Co-workers are raised up, elders are built up, and deacons and deaconesses are produced because the work is carried out in the proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, in some local churches this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For many years they have had only pastors, even though they do not call them that.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In fact they are simply pastors, doing everything for the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the wrong way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In name they are not a division, but in fact they become a division, because what is there is merely a work, not a local church built up by the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we work in the wrong way, sooner or later there will be a division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more we work, the more the work must be passed on to the saints, and the more the responsibility must be in the hands of the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The local saints need to be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some will learn to be the called ones, called by the Lord to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some will be built up as the elders, and some will be perfected as the deacons and deaconesses.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then whether or not workers are there, they will be able to go on by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, all the matters of the church must be in the hands of the local saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we are not clear about this, then the longer we work, the more things will be in our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the contrary, it must be that the more we work, the more things are out of our hands.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After three or four years, everything should be out of the worker s hands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if he is raptured, the church still can go on, even in a better way, because the local saints will improve it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, the saints are perfected by the worker, and then eventually according to how they are perfected, they can build upon the work and make some improvements.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the right way, and in recent years we have been practicing this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sometimes people come to me and ask, These brothers are too young.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They cannot do this job.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why do you let them do it?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must let them do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We cannot stay here for our whole life, and our ministry is not to build up our work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our ministry is to build up the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only this way can save us from making divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually a local church must be built up under the hands of all those persons who have been perfected by the gifted ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the gifted persons must learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, the many gifted persons will make many divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Taking the Proper Way</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>to Perfect and Raise Up All the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have learned this lesson in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For many years there were many prevailing co-workers with Brother Watchman Nee, but no divisions were formed among us because we all learned the lesson not to keep any work in our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not work for our own work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is no work that belongs to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We work only for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I can testify from the depth of my heart that Brother Nee kept nothing in his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His work was wholly for the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was perfected by him very much.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He perfected many by his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He raised up, perfected, and trained the saints to be the elders, deacons, and deaconesses in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all have to learn to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am not merely giving a lecture here.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, I beg you to put these things into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Always learn to do things to perfect others, not simply to do things by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While you are doing things, you need to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In certain large local churches in Taiwan, twenty to fifty co-workers were produced after only five or six years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In addition, many elders, deacons, and deaconesses were established.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you go there, you will realize that these are genuine, proper elders, not in position or name but in reality and in bearing responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Likewise, the deacons and deaconesses have a genuine service.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In other places, however, even after fifty years it is still difficult to find a co-worker who was produced there.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There may be ten or twelve elders, but many are elders only in name and position.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There are also deacons and deaconesses there, but they do not know how to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The responsibility is still in the hand of the one worker.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Does this mean that the Lord had only one person He could raise up there?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We cannot believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord would have raised up more saints.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The only problem is that the co-worker there took the wrong way, working all the time without perfecting others.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I look to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I must exercise my spirit to have the assurance that after five years in the locality where I am there will be a good number raised up, some as co-workers, some as elders, some as deacons, and some as deaconesses serving in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Moreover, after five years some must go out from this country to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is not right for us simply to meet together and fellowship without anyone being raised up by the Lord to go out for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After a certain time there must be some who would be willing to sacrifice everything for the Lord to go out to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>By the Lord s mercy and grace we must work this out.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We cannot work it out ourselves, but if we coordinate and cooperate with the Lord, He will work this out through us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Being Dealt With in Our Motive</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There is a proper technique to learn, but first we need to be purified in our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If our inner motive for working in a certain place is to build up something for our own desire or purpose, it is not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This motive must perish.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is even an idol; we are building up an idol for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to be dealt with in our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must be able to say, We are working here not for ourselves but for the Lord s testimony, His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way many saints will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We all have to learn this, and we must also learn how to be perfected by others.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is why we have our trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The trainings are simply for the purpose of perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I believe that after a certain number of years my responsibility will be discharged.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I will be innocent before the Lord, and you all will be responsible because all these matters will be passed on to you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All these matters are not insignificant, and we all need to learn them.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>On the one hand, we are working, while on the other hand, we are perfecting others by our working, not simply doing things by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We do things in a coordinated way so that others can be perfected by us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we work in this way, eventually all the saints will be brought into their function.</S>
