The more we go on, the clearer the way becomes. The church in Ch'ang-ch'un has been blessed by the Lord more than we could ask or think. There have been a total of four weeks of message meetings with two breaks for days of prayer. The Lord's own word came upon us and resolved all kinds of problems. We saw some matters in the Word for the first time. Today is a great day because God is coming forth! He establishes what is of Himself, and He tears down what is not of Himself. He did not allow us to continue serving Him in the flesh. The day in which God speaks is the day in which His light shines. We can only worship Him and give ourselves more to Him while waiting for His cleansing. I am in more fear and trembling. We have such a great responsibility because we hold the spiritual future of so many brothers and sisters who are pursuing the Lord in our hands! I am so poor and weak in myself! After returning, I have had a time of prayer and spiritual pursuit with the brothers every morning. On the one hand, I desire to be an unwavering and uncompromising person for the sake of the Lord's truth. But on the other hand, I want to pour myself out in loving the brothers. I want to be faithful, but I do not want to hurt others.</p><p>I deeply feel that all work begins from our service before the Lord. Once we meet the Lord we have the way, and once we meet Him we have the truth. Our plans are not the way, and our doctrines are not the truth. Indeed we do not move in ourselves, we can only move when He moves. I do not know how many tears I have shed while I have been looking to Him. We cannot make any more mistakes in the spiritual work in Manchuria. If we make another mistake, we may not have another opportunity to serve for the rest of our lives! Therefore, I am bringing my scars to the brothers. We wait on Him in fear and trembling concerning all matters. Hymn #188 has become our prayer for this fresh start.</p><p>Concerning the principle of Antioch, I have recently felt that Barnabas and Saul were sent out and the brothers commended Paul and Silas to the grace of God. The apostles were the sent ones of the church, so there should be a sending church, and they should go forth in the spirit of oneness. I really say "amen" to having no workers in the central church because the workers are always sent out and commended to the Lord's grace. The spiritual center chosen by God is the center of God's work, and the apostles are sent out in a spirit of oneness. I really feel that the Lord has prepared Ch'ang-ch'un in Manchuria. Therefore, the work in Manchuria as well as the work in Ch'ang-ch'un should proceed according to this principle. If it does not, there will not be much blessing or protection. This has been my main consideration, and I dare not be relaxed in this matter.</p><p>With regard to my occupation, chicken farming takes up too much of my time, and other occupations require too much thought. I want a job that does not require much thought. I want a change in occupation, one that exercises my physical body instead. There is a brother in Harbin who owns a bakery. I plan to go there for two or three months to learn how to make bread on the one hand and to serve the brothers and sisters on the other hand. Perhaps I will start a bakery in the future. Do you think it will be practical? I have already fellowshipped with the brothers, and everyone is seeking the Lord. Brother Zuo-xin also plans to go to Ch'ang-ch'un. In the ministry of the word, Brother Xi-nian is very strong. Brother Wang Xing-yu is bearing some responsibility for the edification of the new ones. There are a few brothers who are able to serve in the ministry of the word. This conference really showed us the right way, and the preaching of our gospel is with more zeal now. Since I left Ch'ang-ch'un, the brothers are better able to carry out their functions.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Hua Tien-min<br />July 17, 1950</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_090.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_092.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 91</div><br></body></html>
