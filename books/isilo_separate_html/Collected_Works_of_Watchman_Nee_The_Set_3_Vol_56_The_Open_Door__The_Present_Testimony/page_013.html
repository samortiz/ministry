I personally am overjoyed every time I read these materials. It is as if the ointment on Aaron's head already has flowed down to such a worthless member as myself. I want to sing, "Hallelujah." I want to seize the opportunity of the third session. May the Lord have mercy on me that the day would come soon when I would be able to follow at your heels and receive the word you receive from God directly from your mouth. May I touch God's heart and be completely edified, until this weak, old, useless member coordinates in the Body in his few remaining days. May we strive together that the spread of the gospel in the northwestern wilderness might be completed soon.</p><p>If the Lord wills, Brother Yin-hsin and I may take a trip west to visit the churches because Shiahe and Dihua have called several times asking us. Please pray for us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />John Lee<br />November 14, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">Supplying One Another (Zhengzhow)</h2><p>For these many years (I have been saved for seven years now), I have been groping in the darkness, unable to find the way and suffering greatly. In God's light I have seen that I am not a person with a stable foundation. If I had met with great temptation, I would have fallen long ago. My life is not only immature, but my knowledge of the truth for the edification of new believers is fragmented as well. I have not touched the central matters, and there are many things that I simply do not know. I am not the only one in this condition; all the brothers and sisters in Zhengzhow are like this.</p><p>The brothers and sisters in Zhengzhow began serving the Lord in 1948. At that time, the brothers and sisters who came from Anyang and Tangyin met together. Brother Pu, who had learned something more in the Lord, was helping them a little. In 1949 Brother Pu returned home, and I began to visit them frequently so that we could supply one another.</p><p>Finally, I beg the Lord to give you a burden to pray for us much and to send us letters frequently according to the Lord's leading. We hope even more that you could come here once to help us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Lee Xi-chen<br />October 11, 1950</p><h2 class="head2">May the Lord Give Us More Tears (Changsha)</h2><p>The church here clearly sees the Lord's leading. There are fruits of the gospel. There was a baptism meeting on the tenth of this month in which seven brothers and sisters testified concerning the Lord. One of the sisters was clearly saved a few days before the meeting, and one of the brothers was my father. The number of people breaking bread has already increased to more than thirty. In the fellowship meetings, the testimonies of the brothers supplied us. The Spirit of the Lord is clearly working in each meeting. After passing through loneliness and desolation in the past, we finally see the Lord working here today. We thank the Lord. "Those who sow in tears/Will reap with a ringing shout." May the Lord give us more tears.</p><p>There are more than ten fellowship groups in the schools in Changsha. Their condition is very good. There are zealous brothers and sisters among them who hope to receive some supply. Sometimes they invite us to speak to them. They are seeking to know the truth and the Lord's straight way. They took the initiative to come fellowship with us. When we saw their situation, we could only ask the Lord to give them the same grace. "O Lord! Remember us who have Your way in this generation!"</p><p>Because the church has been raised up somewhat, the work has become a little heavier, and my own poverty and pitifulness have been exposed. "O Lord! How do I lead Your recently saved children? What do I use to feed those who are hungry and thirsty for you? O Lord! Grace Your own church and remember the desire of Your children. Break my pitiful self. May Your life come out to heal the wounds of others!" O brothers! Remember us often so that in our groping we would find the proper way.</p><p>We have already started a meeting to edify the new believers (Thursday evenings); Brother Chin and I are temporarily taking turns bearing the responsibility. We have already spoken about "Selling All." Some of the word left us in fear and trembling! O Lord! May we not touch Your word loosely.</p><p>Your little brother,<br />Chang Fang-zheng<br />October 23, 1950</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> </body></html>
