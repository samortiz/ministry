   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECURING A CHOICE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that Isaac enjoyed all the wells.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Wherever he went there was a well for his enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This reveals that whether we are right or wrong in our standing there is a well for our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition to enjoying the wells, Isaac secured a choice bride 24:61-67 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He gained her without doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As he was meditating in the field, she came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaac was not a doing person; he was an enjoying person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His father and his servant did everything to secure a bride for him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Isaac did not even go to Rebekah; Rebekah came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In all of history I have never heard of another case in which the bride came to the groom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All Christian natural doings are just a type of supplanting, a type of heel holding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Never supplant or hold the heel of others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rebekah is your portion and she will come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Before the foundation of the world, it was destined that Rebekah would be yours.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do you believe this?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do you dare to claim it?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Isaac received his Rebekah simply by meditating in the field, not by doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GAINING TWIN SONS</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After twenty years without having a child, Isaac gained twin sons 25:20-21, 26b .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Did God not say in His promise that Isaac, the only seed of Abraham, would be the one in whom all the nations of the earth would be blessed?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose Isaac never had a son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How then could this promise be fulfilled?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And if this promise were not fulfilled, how could God's purpose be accomplished?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, it was not only Isaac who needed a son, but also God who needed a seed out of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because Isaac did not realize this for twenty years, God did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God had a need and intended to do something about it, but He required the cooperation from the human side.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For twenty years Isaac was only enjoying, not caring about his need for a son.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But after twenty years, he realized that he had such a need and that his need corresponded to God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once he realized this, he prayed and God answered his prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same is true with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we realize that our need corresponds to God's need and then pray accordingly, God will answer our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Actually, His answer to our prayer is the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our need must be God's need, and the prayer for our need should also be the prayer for God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When our need corresponds with God's and when we then pray for our need, God's need will be met also.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When Isaac prayed for a child, whose need was greater Isaac's or God's?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Surely God's need was greater.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Nevertheless, the greater need of God could only be fulfilled in the smaller need of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only when man realizes his need and prays for it does God have the way to come in to fulfill His need.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has a purpose, and we have a need which corresponds to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But God cannot do anything until we realize our need and pray about it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then God will answer our prayer to meet our need for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, Isaac had a son, Jacob, who not only fulfilled Isaac's need but also fulfilled God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Out of Jacob came Christ, who brings in the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All these eternal things came about through the meeting of Isaac's need, a need which corresponded with God's need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Enjoyment is our destiny, and wherever we go there will be a well.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But in the enjoyment of God's grace, we must render Him our human coordination that He may fulfill His eternal purpose through us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This means that our enjoyment of grace will never be in vain, for the enjoyment of grace on our side eventually becomes the fulfillment of God's purpose on His side.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>RECEIVING A HUNDREDFOLD HARVEST AND BECOMING GREAT</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Isaac received a hundredfold harvest and became great 26:12-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The word great in 26:13 means rich.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Isaac "became great and continued to grow great until he became very great" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He became rich by fulfilling the regular duty of sowing and through the Lord's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This also was a matter of enjoyment, but this enjoyment was not on the proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Isaac might have said to himself, "My standing must be right.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If it were not right, how could the Lord have blessed me with all these riches?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But God might have said, "Isaac, you are settled here and have gained great riches, but I do not agree with your standing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I shall raise up the circumstances to force you to leave this place."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>May the Holy Spirit show us such a vivid picture here.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the one hand, there is the proper enjoyment; on the other hand, there is the improper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even if we lack the proper standing, we may continue to have the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But do not think that this enjoyment justifies your standing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as we have the enjoyment, our need is met.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, we need to get on the proper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Nevertheless, even if we are not on the proper standing, God still grants us His rich provision.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What a wonderful God!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What a wonderful provision!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have been destined for the enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even when we are wrong in our standing, we may still have the rich enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But God will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He will use our circumstances to bring us back to the proper standing that the fulfillment of His purpose might be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>FINDING THE "WELL OF LIVING WATER"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Before Isaac came back to Beer-sheba, he had enjoyment after enjoyment, grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After receiving the hundredfold harvest, he found the "well of living water" and came into the "broad places," the "broad ways" Rehoboth, 26:15-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although he had enjoyment in such a rich way, his standing was not right and he was forced to leave the broad ways and to come back to Beer-sheba.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>COMING BACK TO BEER-SHEBA</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When Isaac returned to Beer-sheba 26:23-33 , the Lord immediately appeared to him, speaking to him and confirming His promise, saying, "I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake" 26:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then, here in Beer-sheba Isaac began to have the proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He built an altar, called upon the name of the Lord, and pitched his tent 26:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Here in Beer-sheba he had a life for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Eventually, here in Beer-sheba the opposers were subdued 26:26-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Beer-sheba is the right place, the place where we can have the proper standing, and the proper standing means a great deal both to God and to us.</S>
