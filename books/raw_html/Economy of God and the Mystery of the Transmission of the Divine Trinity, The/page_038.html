<h2 class=head1>THE DIVINE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2><p>In order to receive the divine transmission, every morning we must spend time to contact the Lord. As a result, we will have the motivating power for the whole day. For example, if you want to take a trip by car, especially a long trip, the safest thing to do is to go to the gas station first to have the car filled up with gasoline and to make sure your battery is fully charged with electricity. In like manner, every day we need to be “filled up with gas” and “charged with electricity.” What is the “gas” with which we are filled? And what is the “electricity” with which we are charged? John 16:15 shows us that we need to have the Triune God added to us and transmitted into us. This transmission is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.<h2 class=head1>BEING A CORPORATE EXPRESSION</h2><p>Once the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are dispensed into us, They are mingled with us and become one with us. For example, there are twenty to thirty fluorescent lamps in the meeting hall. once the electricity is transmitted, all the lamps light up. Outwardly, there are twenty to thirty lamps, but inwardly there is only one flow of electricity. The lamps are many, but the electricity is one. Moreover, there is only one shining and one light. Therefore, the twenty to thirty lamps have only one flow of electricity and give out only one light. This is a corporate expression.<p>If there is only one lamp in the room, although it may shine, the shining is not corporate but individual. There is only one lamp, one flow of electricity within, and one shining without. The electricity in the lamp, the lamp itself, and the illumination of the lamp are all one. This is an individual expression. This was the situation when the Lord Jesus was on the earth. He was an individual “lamp,” and His shining on people and His expression of God were both individual. However, today, as His multiplication, we are thousands and millions of “Jesuses,” thousands and millions of “lamps.” Yet the “electricity” within is still one and the “shining” without is also one. This is a corporate expression.<p>Stanza 3 of Hymns, #501 says, “All things of the Father are Thine; / All Thou art in Spirit is mine; / The Spirit makes Thee real to me, / That Thou experienced might be.” This stanza, which is written exactly according to John 16:15, says that all that the Father has is given to and received by the Son; all that the Son has received and all that He has is in the Spirit; the Spirit makes the Son real to us by entering into us; and as a result, this reality may become our experience. This means that if we listen to many messages concerning Christ, the Son, but do not have the Spirit of reality coming into us, none of the messages will be reality. When the Spirit comes into our spirit, this is the coming of the reality of the Son, and the result is that this reality becomes our experience. This may be considered the best explanation of John 16:15.
