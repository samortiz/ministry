   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>How can I distinguish between a prayer burden and my own desire to pray for something?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Just go to the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not have your mind made up about what you will pray.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Simply go to the Lord and be taught by Him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Just as a little child gradually picks up new words and learns to talk, so little by little you will learn to talk to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This kind of prayer helps you to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not worry about praying for your family.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether you pray for them or not, the Lord takes care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He says to seek the kingdom and righteousness of the Father first; then whatever you need He will add to you Matt 6:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While I am driving, I want to talk to the Lord, but I don't know what to say, and it seems as though the Lord is not really there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not exercise your mind so much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Remember you have an inheritance of the Spirit within and the Bible without.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are the unique means by which to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As you are driving and have the desire to contact the Lord, begin to talk to Him in a spontaneous way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just follow the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you have a sense to thank the Lord, just say, "Lord, thank You."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you say this, some further feeling will be there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Lord, thank You that You are so good to me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thank You that You are now with me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I enjoy Your presence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thank You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You are one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am one with You."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To your surprise, all these words will come.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the moving of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unbelievers have no such living sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whatever you are doing, just address the Lord in a talking way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"Lord, I am here again with You.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What shall I say, Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank You for this day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a day for me to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today I can experience Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Something will come from within because you have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sometimes you may feel dull.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Take out your Bible and turn to the portion you have been reading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It would be helpful for you all to have a pocket version of the Bible at hand all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not open it at random.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the Ephesians training I have been on Philippians, going through it very slowly, perhaps only two or three verses a day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These verses become my prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Spontaneously, the verses you are reading through consecutively become your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They will give you prayer for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you contact the Lord like this, you will have more and more of Him added to your being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This way will cleanse, enlighten, correct, and transform you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes I feel I am dishonoring the Lord if I speak to Him in a normal way, in a conversational tone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In all our daily life we should respect the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The whole day we are to be in His presence, even if we are not praying or reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Anywhere and at any time we can talk to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The best prayer is not a religious prayer but a talk with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To pray in a talking way does not dishonor the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we live a life of constantly respecting Him, however we pray honors Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have gone to the Lord and repented of certain things that happened before I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They still keep coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is this of Satan, or do I need to deal with them further?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No doubt this is of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The principle is found in 1 John 1:9 and 7.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whatever sin you confess before God is cleansed by the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God is faithful and righteous to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is not only a promise but also a speaking of the fact; whenever we confess a sin, we must believe that it was cleansed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many believers are bothered by sins they have already confessed.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then they confess again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once you do this, you fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you confess the same sin a second time, it means you do not believe the blood has cleansed you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I remember when I was young I confessed to the Lord that I had offended someone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to the word of the New Testament surely I was washed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But Satan came and said, "No, you did not confess in detail."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I then went back to the Lord and confessed in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Again Satan said, "No, you have left out some of the details."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I made a further confession.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then Satan said, "You have confessed, but you were not sincere."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>So I told the Lord I was sorry I had not confessed sincerely and asked Him to make me sincere.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Again Satan said, "You didn't say in the name of the Lord Jesus.'</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>" Eventually I got clear and told Satan, "Get behind me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Why should I confess more than once when I was washed the first time?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Bible doesn't say that if you confess your sin in detail, sincerely, and in the name of the Lord Jesus, you will be washed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It only says, if you confess your sins God is faithful, and the blood of Jesus cleanses."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>That shut the door to the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do not confess a sin you have already confessed.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Satan is subtle.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Either he will keep you from confessing, or he will push you to keep confessing the same thing over and over.</S>
