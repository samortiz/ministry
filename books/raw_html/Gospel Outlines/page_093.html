<h1 class="title">THE RICH MAN AND LAZARUS&mdash;<br />
The Second Contrast in Luke</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Luke 16:19-31<br />
The stories in Luke 15 through Luke 23 are all in contrast.</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Two different persons<br />
<span class="normal">One is rich; the other is poor.</span></li>
<li>The difference while alive
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The rich man was clothed in purple and fine linen and was living in mirth and splendor every day. To be clothed in purple indicates that he was honorable and wealthy. To be clothed in fine linen indicates that he was living in abundance. Describe how the rich man enjoyed his life.</li>
	<li>The poor man was full of sores, and was laid at the gate of the rich man.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The difference after death
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Describe the condition of the beggar after he died. In this portion of the Bible, it mentions the rich man first and then the beggar, because it was the rich man&rsquo;s world while they were alive. On the street, you see that the rich man walks in front and the beggar follows after. But after their death, the order was reversed. It mentions the poor man first and then the rich man, because it was the poor man&rsquo;s world after death. Dogs came and licked the poor man&rsquo;s sores while he was alive. When he died, he was carried away by the angels. How lonesome he was when he was laid at the gate of the rich man. Yet after he died, he was in Abraham&rsquo;s bosom. How comfortable and how sweet it was then!</li>
	<li>The rich man also died. Not only the poor ones will die, but the rich ones too! Money cannot buy life. As the poor people will die, so also will the millionaires die. <em>Emphasize the word &ldquo;also.&rdquo;</em> No one can escape death. Poor or rich, lowly or honorable, man or woman, young or old makes no difference. They all will die someday. And one day you <em>also</em> will die. Use the word <em>also</em> to cover all classes of people, such as the laborers, college students, taxi drivers, university professors, guards, school superintendents, etc. The sick ones shall die, so also shall the doctors die.</li>
	<li>The rich man was buried. The rich man had quite a funeral, but there were no angels coming to carry him, nor was he put into the bosom of Abraham; rather, he was in torment in Hades. And he lifted up his eyes, and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom. He used to drink soda, coke, beer, and wine, but now he could not even get a drop of water. Formerly his tongue enjoyed blessings&mdash;his speech was so powerful and influential, and with his tongue he scorned so many people. But now it is in torment in the flame. This is only the flame of Hades, not the flame of the lake of fire yet. Abraham said, &ldquo;Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and Lazarus in like manner evil things: but now here he is comforted, and thou art in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, that they that would pass from hence to you may not be able, and that none may cross over from thence to us.&rdquo; If you do not ask God in your lifetime, it will be too late to ask God after you die.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The reasons for the difference
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Their difference was not a matter of being rich or poor, nor was it a matter of enjoying or suffering in their lifetime.</li>
	<li>Their difference was a matter of whether they believed in God&rsquo;s words. For the Lord said clearly that they should believe in Moses&rsquo; words. To believe in God&rsquo;s words is to believe in Christ, because God&rsquo;s words are centered on Christ. Here &ldquo;the one from the dead&rdquo; refers to Christ. The rich man would not believe in the Bible or Christ in his lifetime so he was in torment in the flame after he died.</li>
	<li>Because the rich man did not believe in God&rsquo;s words, so in his lifetime he indulged himself in all kinds of luxurious pleasure and never cared about his future problem. The poor Lazarus believed in God&rsquo;s words, so he could be careless about his suffering in his lifetime.</li>
	<li>Friends, if you do not believe in God&rsquo;s gospel, if you only care for the present life and never take thought about after your death, how pitiful it is! Please quickly believe in God&rsquo;s words and believe in Jesus.</li>
	</ol></li>
