   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Considering Himself a Son to Him</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verses 2 through 9 David sought help from Nabal, a wealthy man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David sent ten young men to Nabal, instructing them to say to him, "Live long; and peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have" v. 6 . The young men were also to say, "Give whatever you may have on hand to your servants and to your son David" v. 8 . Here David was very humble, considering himself a servant and a son to Nabal.</S>

   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There are many servants today who break away from their masters.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then David said, "It was certainly in vain that I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that he has; for he has repaid me evil for good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May God do so to David's enemies, and even more, if I leave so much as a male child of all that he has until morning" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>21-22 .</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He bore the cross under Saul, but in this small cross he failed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If David had taken the cross in this situation, he might have praised the Lord for Nabal's refusal to provide food.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then God might have come in to inspire Nabal to repent and come to David with an abundance of food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, with Nabal David did not take the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The situation is often the same with us today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It may be easy for us to prevail in bearing the bigger crosses, but we may be careless in bearing the smaller crosses.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Through the small crosses the flesh is exposed.</S>
