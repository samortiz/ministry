   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Staying with God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Moses was on the mountain of God, he stayed with God under His glory for forty days and forty nights.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the Bible, the number forty signifies tests or trials.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is difficult for us to stand God s tests.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We prefer to see the vision very quickly, within the space of a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But to see a revelation from God requires a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It took Moses forty days and forty nights to see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From my experience I can testify that it has taken me forty years to see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Little by little throughout the years, the Lord has shown His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not think that we can see the divine revelation in a hasty way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some experiences we had in the Lord s recovery years ago demonstrate that it takes time to see God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 1964 some brothers decided that they would move to different cities in the United States to spread the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At first I agreed that such a move would be good for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A few weeks later, however, I encouraged the brothers to wait for a period of time, perhaps three years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some brothers nevertheless went out to different places and tried to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Each situation was a failure, and the brothers came back convinced that they should wait a period of time before trying to spread the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Three years later, in 1967, I encouraged the saints to wait for another three years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some brothers could not pass this test of time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Unable to wait any longer, they went out on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>History has proved that all those who went out in this way were not successful.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This indicates that spiritual things take time.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to see the vision Moses had to spend forty days and forty nights under the glory on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The forty days Moses was with the Lord on the mountaintop were a test to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They were not able to wait for Moses to come down from the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They demanded that Aaron make them a god.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The people took golden rings and brought them to Aaron, and he fashioned them with a graving tool into a calf 32:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the people said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt v. 4 . Instead of seeing a vision, the people, unable to bear the test of time, made a god for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They could look at the golden calf and declare that this was the god that rescued them from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, it was an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The situation is the same in principle among many Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They may boast that they have seen a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, what they have is nothing more than a calf, a self-made idol.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not able to take the time needed to see God s revelation, they make idols for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CONCERNING THE MATERIALS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 25:1-7 God revealed to Moses the materials, the basic elements, to be used in building the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All the materials represent basic elements we should use in building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every element, however, is lacking among today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of caring for the materials which correspond to God s revelation, Christians are taught how to organize and how to use psychology.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the Lord s recovery we do not teach psychology or organization.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to know all the heavenly materials in a thorough way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A. Referring to the Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>of Christ s Person and Work</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the materials described in 25:1-7 refer to the virtues of Christ s Person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that these materials signify different aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They signify the virtues of what He is in His Person and of what He has done and will do in His work.</S>
