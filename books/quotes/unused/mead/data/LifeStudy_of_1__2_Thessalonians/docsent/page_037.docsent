   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING WORTHILY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have placed a strong emphasis on the fact that, according to 1:1, the church is an entity in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us go on to consider 2:12: "That you should walk worthily of God, Who calls you into His own kingdom and glory."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does it mean to walk worthily of God?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To walk worthily of God is to have a life in the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Thessalonians 2:12 is an explanation of 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does it mean for the church to be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For the church to be in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ in a practical way is for there to be a company of human beings who walk worthily of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What can compare with God?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What can match Him?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The answer to these questions is that only God Himself can compare with God or match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that to walk worthily of God actually means to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our daily life must actually be God Himself, since only God can be worthy of God, match God, or compare with God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, in our living we must express God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because we have God's life, we can live God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A dog obviously has a dog's life and therefore lives a dog.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same principle, we have God's life and therefore we can live God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah, God is our Father, and we are His children!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As God's children with His life, it is possible for us to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whereas 1:1 speaks of the church in God the Father, many Christians instead speak of the church in God the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Christian services often that hymn is sung which begins, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To you, is God only the Almighty, or is He also your Father?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we have been born of Him, God is now our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Almighty, God does not have any life relationship with you, and you may not have anything to do with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may be apart from Him and outside of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But if God has become your Father, you now have a life relationship with Him, and you are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whom do you love more, the President of the United States, or your own father?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The President may be wealthy, and your father may be poor, but certainly you love your father more than you love the President.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In a far deeper way, we love God more as our Father than as merely the Almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hallelujah, because we are children of God we can live God!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We all should declare boldly, "Because I have God's life, I can live Him."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we see what it means to walk worthily of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only God can be worthy of Himself, and only God can match Himself or be compared with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, to walk worthily of God is to live God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Praise the Lord that we have God's life and that we can walk worthily of Him by living Him!</S>
