   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CRUCIFIED WITH CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not only in Romans, but other places in the Bible say that we are crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is no longer I who live, because the "I" has been crucified with Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Read Galatians 5:24 again.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We do not do the crucifying; we are crucified already with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen that Christ bore our sins on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we see that He also bore our very person on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He has become a substitute for our sins as well as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On that day on the cross, there were not only our sins, but also our person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has included both our sins and our person in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When Christ was crucified, so were we.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we see this one point, the rest will be clear.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A hymn describes well this fact:</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am crucified with Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And the cross hath set me free;</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have ris'n again with Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And He lives and reigns in me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Oh! it is so sweet to die with Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To the world, and self, and sin;</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Oh! it is so sweet to live with Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As He lives and reigns within.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hymns, #482, verse 1</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>CHRIST IS A CORPORATE MAN</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can see from the Bible that Christ is not an individual person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is a corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is like a legal term, a "juristic person."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone is incorporated into such a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whatever the juristic person does signifies the act of everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Using our previous analogy, it is the same as saying that if Hwang-ti had died, all of his descendants would have died; the whole Chinese race would have been terminated there.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are included in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When Christ died on the cross, we who are in Him died on it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>By the judgment of Christ we are forgiven; by His death we are set free from ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the negative side, we receive the forgiveness of sins outwardly and the termination of the old life inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the positive side, we start afresh in Christ with the new life obtained from God.</S>
