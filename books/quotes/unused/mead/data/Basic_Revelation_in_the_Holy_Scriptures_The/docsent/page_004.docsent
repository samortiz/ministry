   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>His Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9 the word oikonomia is used for household administration, which is God s plan to dispense Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 3:2, Colossians 1:25 and 1 Corinthians 9:17 the same word refers to Paul s stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word stewardship is used in the sense of dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s stewardship was the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With Paul the word stewardship refers to the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word steward is used in 1 Peter 4:10, which says that we all need to be good stewards, dispensing the varied grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The varied grace of the rich God needs many stewards to dispense it; this dispensing is their stewardship.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What I am doing in the ministry is to dispense the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you tell me I am a good Bible teacher, I appreciate your word, but I do not like to hear it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not consider me a teacher!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am a dispenser!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am not merely teaching the Bible; I am dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I once went to get a flu shot.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There was a long line of people, and all of us had to offer our arm so that we could get the shot.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In my ministry I want to give people a shot, an injection, of the riches of Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I have the full assurance that whoever comes to this ministry will get such an injection!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our stewardship today is the same as Paul s. Paul s stewardship was simply to give people an injection: that is, to distribute, to dispense, the unsearchable riches of Christ into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is God s economy, His plan, His administration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>GOD S SELECTION</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God had a good pleasure, and according to His good pleasure He made a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Following this, He arranged a universal administration of His household to dispense His riches into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He selected us, not only before we were created, but also before the foundation of the world Eph 1:4; 1 Pet 1:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nothing of His creation had yet come into existence when He selected us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is difficult to buy things in a shopping center because there are so many things to choose from.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>People do not buy blindly; they consider and choose carefully what they will buy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In eternity past, before His creation, God saw you and said, I like that one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without being selected, I do not believe I could have become a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even though I was born into Christianity, I was not a Christian until I was nineteen years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was educated within Christianity, but I still did not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, one day God touched me and said, I want you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That day I was caught.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How about you?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Behind the scenes there is an eternal and almighty hand directing everything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our selection is a wonderful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our heavenly Father is happy when He sees us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are His heart s desire, His good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s pleasure is not with the moon, the sun, the heavens, or the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He tells us clearly in His Word that He is not satisfied merely with the earth and the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What satisfies Him is His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are His good pleasure, and His plan was made for us.</S>
