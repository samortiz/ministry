   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO REPENT IS NOT ENOUGH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How does God forgive our sins?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people have an erroneous concept concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that although they have committed many sins, the sins can all be pardoned if they repent of their evil conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But repentance can never remit a sin that you have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No matter how much you repent, your sins are still there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You may regret your sins as much as you want, but they will not be removed simply by your repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I was preaching in Kaifeng, some government officials were present.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I told them, suppose a bandit committed many crimes and murdered many, but was not caught for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then one day he appeared before you, saying, "I repent of all my past misconduct.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From now on I am going to reform.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have determined to be a law-abiding citizen and a good man."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Please tell me, would his repentance annul his former crimes, the cases brought up against him by his victims, and the prosecutions conducted against him by the law?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Would they be nullified?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Would the law let him go?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>MUST BE MAINTAINED</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Bible shows us that all sins incur certain kinds of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Nothing we do is lightly passed over.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The outward manifestation of our life is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only do we sin against ourselves, but we sin against others and, above all, against God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He cannot evasively bypass our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His righteousness does not permit Him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I remember a true story.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a man murdered someone and stole a sum of money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He then took refuge in another town.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There he married and had some children.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The people in that place knew nothing of his past.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day, three detectives came to look for him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They found the man and were about to take him away.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The man turned to his wife and asked, "For all these years that I have been with you, have I not been a good husband?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The wife agreed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then he turned to his children, saying, "Am I not a good father to you?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The children also nodded.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally he turned to his neighbors: "In all these years, have I ever intruded upon your property or done any wrong to you?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Would you not consider me a good neighbor?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They all consented unanimously that he was a fine person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He then turned around to the three detectives and defended himself, saying, "See, I have been a good man all these years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here are all these witnesses testifying to my goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You should let me go!"</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The three replied, "You may be justified before everybody, but you are not justified before the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Your repentance may guarantee your future innocence, but it can never remove your past guilt, nor can it deliver you from the judgment of the law."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the end, he had to face his trial in court.</S>
