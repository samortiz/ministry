The gospel demands not only that we preach it, but that we live it. The gospel not only must be heard, but also must be seen. No preaching can match the act of a martyr. More people are gained through an act of martyrdom than through the work of preaching.</p><p>There was a sister who was nineteen or twenty years old. For the Lord's sake, she was banished to Siberia. On her way in the train, she comforted her family and said to them, "Do not cry for me. Cry instead for those who do not have God. What I have far exceeds what they have. I am happy to suffer for the sake of my beloved Lord. The suffering that I endure can never match that of my Lord.'' A young thirteen-year-old boy sitting close by heard this word, and he was greatly moved to believe in the Lord. Later, he became one of the great workers used by the Lord in southern Czarist Russia.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Impact in the Gospel</h2><p>Strictly speaking, we need men of Acts 2 before we can have messages of Acts 2. What we have to do today is not simply preach, but have an impact on others. If we preach the gospel in this way, a fleshly man will not even be able to come into the church, let alone to go on afterwards. If there are such men and there are those who live this kind of life, corporately there will be the impact and the influence, and others will catch on to the warmth and the joy. Life is a matter of consciousness and feeling. With some people, you can only shake their hands; you cannot touch their spirit or their real person. If a person has the things of God, others will only sense the things of God in him. If a person has the life of God, others will sense the life of God in him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY BEING A MATTER<br />OF THE INWARD BURDEN</h2><p>All proper ministers are burdened with a message. If a man has a ministry, he will always be burdened with a few strong words that remain with him. These few words become his burden. Sometimes the burden may appear very small, but the more the person explains it, the more words there will be. It is like woolen yarn; the more you pull it, the more yarn you see. Any ministry that is of any worth is a ministry with a burden. Within the ministry there is a specific burden.</p><p>When some people are preaching on the podium, their minds are always spinning. With others, only empty words come out of them. When others listen to their words, they do not receive any Spirit; they only receive sounds. All real ministries have a burden within their words. The ones speaking may come feeling heavy, but they should leave feeling light. When they speak, they speak with a burden from within. If a man does not have a burden, any preaching he conducts with his mind and thoughts will be useless. A ministry must have a ministry's burden. The greatest suffering is for a person to come with something but find no one picking up his words. In the end he carries back the same burden that he brought with him.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MOVE OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES</h2><p>The problem of the move of the local churches must be solved in the Body. It is useless to try to solve it separately. The Lord must first have a way among us. Only when He has a way among us will He have a way among the churches. If He does not get through with us, He will not be able to solve the problems separately in the different localities.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 39</div><br></body></html>
