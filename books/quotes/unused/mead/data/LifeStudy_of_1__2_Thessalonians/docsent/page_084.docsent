   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>POSSESSING OUR BODY IN SANCTIFICATION AND HONOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As Paul was writing chapter three of 1 Thessalonians, he must have had the intention to go from the inner being, the heart, to the outer being, the body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the reason he gives the charge concerning abstaining from fornication and concerning possessing our body in sanctification and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Fornication is a gross sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to the Bible, Satan's purpose is to use sin to defile the man God created for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any kind of vessel is defiled when it becomes dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the function of a dirty and defiled vessel is annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, we do not use a cup that is dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Before a dirty cup can be used, it must first be cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God created man as a pure vessel, but Satan injected sin into man with the intention of defiling him and spoiling him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The most defiling sin is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Stealing is sinful and unclean, but it is not as defiling as fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fornication damages God's purpose, it damages the human body, and it damages the family and society.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing else damages humanity as seriously as fornication does.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, after speaking concerning the sanctification of the heart, the inward being, Paul could not forget to speak concerning the outward being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fornication always comes from a changing heart, a heart that has not been established.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If your heart has been established, it will be difficult for Satan to seduce you to commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But it is easy for those who are changeable and fickle to fall into the snare of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As Paul was writing chapter three, he probably had the thought of going on to write concerning the believers' outward being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He may have said to himself, "Paul, you are speaking concerning the inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Faith is a matter of the heart, and love is a matter of the emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both are related to the inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But what about the body outwardly?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul was an excellent writer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When he writes about a matter, he writes about it to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, when he comes to the matter of outward sanctification, he deals with the most defiling sin, the sin of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Stay away from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you become involved in fornication, you will open the door wide to all kinds of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Believers and unbelievers have been damaged by the gross sin of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, Paul commands the believers to abstain from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He tells them that sanctification is God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because God's will is to keep us always in sanctification, we should abstain from everything that is unclean so that the body may be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At this point I would like to say a word to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As Christians, we may need to read the newspapers to know the world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I read a newspaper nearly every day, but certain pages I would never read, for they are defiling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once your mind has been defiled by looking at a certain picture, it will be very difficult for you to remove this defiling element.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, we should not listen to certain kinds of conversations or touch things that are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But most important we should abstain from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must keep, preserve, safeguard, our vessel clean in sanctification before God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It must be holy, separated, and saturated with God and also kept in honor before man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man was created by God with honor, for man was made in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, we are to express God and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have been assigned a most honorable position.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Marriage is a holy and honorable matter, and it is for the fulfillment of God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the reason the Bible tells us to honor marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But fornication destroys mankind and causes the one who falls into it to lose his honor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we must preserve our body clean in sanctification and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A HOLY LIFE FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I believe we have touched the burden in Paul's spirit as he was writing chapters three and four of 1 Thessalonians.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First he dealt with the inward being represented by the heart and then with the outward being represented by the body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Inwardly, our heart must be established in holiness; outwardly, our body must be preserved in sanctification and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is to have a holy life, and this holy life is for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we have a heart established blameless in holiness and a body preserved clean in sanctification and honor, then, in a practical way, we shall have a holy life for the church life.</S>
