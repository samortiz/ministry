<p>When Solomon dedicated the temple to God, there were priests in the temple and kings in the city. The temple was the holy temple, and the city was the city of Jerusalem. The priests were Levites, and the temple was where God&rsquo;s presence was found and God&rsquo;s glory was manifested. The kings were Israelites, and the city was where God reigned and His will was carried out unhindered. The priests and the kings took heed to the word of God, that is, the revelation of God and the books of law.</p>
<p>Later the kingdom of Israel became desolate, the temple and the city were lost, and the books of law were taken away. This means that the presence of God, the authority of God, and the revelation of God were lost. According to the history of the church, the church also became desolate, losing the presence, authority, and revelation of God. When the church degraded into Roman Catholicism, God&rsquo;s presence and authority were lost, and all that remained was human rule (cf. Rev. 2:20). The revelation of God was also lost, and the church became filled with the teachings of the deep things of Satan (v. 24) and human opinions.</p>
<p>When God began His work of recovery, He carried it out according to three lines: the temple of God, the city of God, and the word of God. People such as Ezra, Zerubbabel, and Nehemiah came out of Babylon and returned to the original ground to rebuild the temple and the city. Particular heed was given to recovering the word of God. Ezra mainly recovered the teaching of the law of the Old Testament. His expounding of the law in the Scriptures was even more enlightening than the Scriptural exposition at the time of Moses (Ezra 7:6, 10). The final two lines in the recovery work of God include the temple and the city. The temple is a matter of God&rsquo;s presence; the city is a matter of His authority. The temple was recovered by Zerubbabel, and the city was recovered by Nehemiah. Ezra, as a scribe, recovered the priesthood, and Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, as heads of the province, represented the kingship.</p>
<p>The recovery consists of three things: the recovery of God&rsquo;s word, God&rsquo;s presence, and God&rsquo;s authority. Since Martin Luther, there have been some Zerubbabels, Ezras, and Nehemiahs in the process of the recovery of the church. When we read the books that these ones have written, we sense that a certain one was an Ezra and that another was a Zerubbabel or a Nehemiah. Some recovered the matter of the authority of God and the word of God, and others recovered the matter of fellowshipping with God, which is the recovery of the temple. For example, George M&#252;ller surely had the presence of God, which is represented by the temple.</p>
<p>The recovery of the children of Israel in the Old Testament is a precise type of the recovery of the church in the New Testament. In the period of recovery, the light that the teachers among the Brethren received was far beyond what others had previously seen, especially in relation to the word of God. The recovery of God&rsquo;s word is a great matter in the Lord&rsquo;s work of recovery. Of course, the temple and the city also needed to be recovered. The temple is related to God&rsquo;s image, whereas the city is related to God&rsquo;s authority. The two lines of image and authority spoken of in Genesis 1 continue all the way to Revelation. First, the recovery of the temple occurred, that is, the recovery of God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s image; then came the recovery of the city, the recovery of God&rsquo;s authority. Ezra brought in the recovery of God&rsquo;s word, Zerubbabel brought in the recovery of the temple, and Nehemiah brought in the recovery of the city. The history of the recovery of the church is the history of the recovery of the word of God, the temple, and the city.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Christ&rsquo;s Second Coming</h2>
<p>The books of Zechariah and Malachi speak of awaiting Christ&rsquo;s coming. After the children of Israel were recovered, even though they still had weaknesses and failures, they had a glorious hope: the coming of Christ. In the church the matters of the word of God, the temple, and the city have been recovered to a certain degree. In certain ones we are able to see God&rsquo;s presence in a strong way, which is the recovery of the temple. In others we are able to see God&rsquo;s authority, which is the recovery of the city. Moreover, God&rsquo;s word is transparent in the church and is filling the church. Throughout the past two thousand years the Bible has never been so thoroughly known by men as it is today. We can say that today in the church the Bible is a transparent book. In the age of Moses, men&rsquo;s knowledge of the law was not as clear as it was in the age of Ezra. In the same way, in the church today the Bible is much more transparent to us than it was fifteen hundred years ago. This is the recovery work of God.</p>
<p>The word of God is recovered, the temple is recovered, and the city is also recovered. Although desolation still exists, in the midst of the desolation there is a continual recovery with a glorious hope: the second coming of Christ.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
