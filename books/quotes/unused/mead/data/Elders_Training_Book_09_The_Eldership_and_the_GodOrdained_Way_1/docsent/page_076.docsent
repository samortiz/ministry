   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD'S PRESENT RECOVERY 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our burden is to fellowship concerning the practice of the Lord's advanced recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beginning in 1984 I began to have a new study that lasted about four and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The subject of my study was the New Testament way of Christian service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We needed to see how to serve God, how to meet together, how to function, how to carry out the work, and how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We needed to investigate how to carry out these things according to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, throughout the history of the church, some of the seeking saints saw certain things concerning how to serve, how to meet, how to function, and how to preach the gospel to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They saw the truth concerning such things as baptism by immersion and the administration of the presbytery, the eldership, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A big advance concerning the practice of the church life was with Zinzendorf and the Moravian Brethren in the eighteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then in the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the British Brethren to recover more.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the twentieth century, the Lord brought us in mainland China into His recovery through Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He took the lead to read about the history of the church and to read the main writings of the seeking ones throughout the centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We put many of the things we saw into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later, we found out that some of the things in our practice were not so fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 1931 the Brethren sent some saints to visit us in Shanghai, and their visit caused a lot of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Brother Nee went abroad to visit them in 1933, and he saw the real situation among them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through that visit, he saw the shortages in the practice of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then he saw the boundary of the local church and the local ground of the church to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Brethren did not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Later he saw the revelation of the meeting of the church as unveiled in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to this revelation, when the whole church comes together, each saint should have something to share, so "each one has" v. 26 . Brother Nee called this kind of meeting a meeting of mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This meeting is not according to the traditional way of meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such a traditional way of meeting has become the major meeting and the major structure of the practice of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the meeting with one person speaking and the rest listening were taken away from Christianity, the entire structure of Christianity would collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Nee saw that this meeting was not scriptural, and he said that it was according to the customs of the nations 2 Kings 17:8 NASB .</S>
