   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Place of the Male and the Female July 28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible the male represents truth and stands for objective things, whereas the female represents experience and stands for subjective things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a family the male must assume the responsibility of authority and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Talk with George Cutting July 28</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was in England, I visited George Cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At that time he was quite old.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I talked with him for about half an hour.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The clearest word that came out of his mouth was, "Our Lord needs us and we need Him."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Cutting's book, Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, has sold more than 10 million copies.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Next to the Bible, it is the most widely circulated book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Living in His Presence All the Time July 25</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mr. Sparks said that many people do not live in God's presence during ordinary times; they turn to God only when there is a crisis.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we practice living in His presence during ordinary times, we will save ourselves from many cumbersome procedures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Reckoning at the Time</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of the Resurrection of the Righteous July 25</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once I went with an older brother to shop.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When he was ready to leave, he paid his money quickly, turned to me, and said, "It is better to reckon everything now than to reckon it at the time of the resurrection of the righteous."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I asked him what he meant, and he answered that a debt today will cost more on that day; a dollar today is worth only a dollar, but on that day, it will be compounded through interest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Famous Examples</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>of Answers to Prayers July 28</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 Once George M ller was going to Quebec.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was scheduled to arrive on Saturday afternoon, but the fog was too heavy and his ship was detained for twenty four hours.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He tried to persuade the captain to set sail in spite of the fog, saying that he had to arrive in Quebec by Saturday afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At first the captain would not give in, saying, "Do you not know how heavy the fog is?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>M ller answered, "No, my eyes do not see the fog; they only see the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The captain thought that this man must have just come out of a mental asylum.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Mr. M ller turned back into the cabin and prayed to the Lord, "I have promised others that I will be there for my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I miss the appointment, I will let them down.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let the captain of this ship know that you are God by blowing the fog away."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After he prayed he went back to the deck and told the captain, "You can set sail now.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The fog is retreating."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Indeed, the fog began to move away.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, the captain of the ship testified that he had thought that Mr. M ller was mentally sick.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, when he saw with his own eyes how God had heard Mr. M ller's prayer, he could not help but be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>2 Once there was a famine in the province of Shensi, and a few believers were praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Suddenly a strong wind blew toward them and brought chestnuts which piled up three or four feet high.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Later when they testified about this in a meeting, a few hundred believers from the province of Suiyuen remembered that at the time they prayed, a strong wind came and cleaned up the chestnuts from their threshing floor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The huge black cloud took all the chestnuts and moved in the direction of the Shensi province.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>About Evan Roberts July 28</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One of Mr. Evan Roberts's frequent prayers was, "Bend me low, Lord." Another frequent prayer was, "Bend the church low to save the world." These two prayers were his lifelong prayers and were recorded in The Overcomer magazine between 1913 and 1914.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Mr. Roberts was an uneducated coal miner.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>During their meetings, one could hear children crying and carrying on, yet there was no disorder because God was presiding over the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One man by the name of Williams was a newspaper reporter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He went to the meetings to look for Mr. Roberts but did not find him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, he found him in a school where many elementary school students were gathering together to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the children saw Mr. Williams, they surrounded him and asked him to preach to them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Mr. Williams was taken by surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He had spoken on numerous occasions, but he did not know what a message was.</S>

   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When he knelt down to pray, the children surrounded him.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Mr. Williams went over and sat by him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Mr. Roberts was silent for a long time and only opened his mouth to adjust one man who was calling a hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After Mr. Williams saw all these things, he resigned from his work at the newspaper company and followed Mr. Roberts to learn from him the way to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Mr. Roberts preached between the age of nineteen and twenty-six.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then he became sick, and he is still too sick to work today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is still alive today and in his fifties.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A believer who talked with him for about two hours testified later that he had never met a person with as little self-consciousness as Mr. Roberts had.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In collaboration with Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis, he wrote War on the Saints, a book on spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Prior to him, no one knew anything about the spiritual warfare spoken of in Ephesians 6.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Experience of Healing August 31</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I was sick for one hundred sixty-five days.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The last episode was the most trying of all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I could not sleep at night, and I was constantly sweating.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>During my sickness, many prayers seemed to have disappeared from me; I was not able to hold on to any promise from the Lord or trust in His healing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Once when Brother Chang Kwang-rong saw my pain, he said, "I wish I could die for you."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I would not allow others to give me any medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I said, "I will not take any medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If I die, God is responsible for my death.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But if you give me medicine and I die, you will have to be responsible for my death."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>On the last day of my sickness, the head nurse in the Health Department called my friends and relatives and asked them to make preparations for my funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Many people came and wept.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>On that day, I heard a soft voice coming from afar, saying, "Watchman Nee, I have healed you."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then I asked someone to fetch my clothing and shoes and to hire a car for me.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I took the car and rode to Miss Dora Yu's house.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>She thought that I was a ghost.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After I was healed, I was able to walk downstairs by myself.</S>
