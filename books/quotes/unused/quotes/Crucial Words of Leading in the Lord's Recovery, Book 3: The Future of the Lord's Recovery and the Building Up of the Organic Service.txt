By the Lords mercy the Lords recovery has spread from the Chinesespeaking world that is from the Chinese language to many other languages
In this message we will consider the history of the Lord's recovery in Taiwan during the past thirty-five years, beginning from 1949
Before 1948 the Lord's recovery was not fully established in Taiwan; hence, that time should not be considered as the initial stage
Before 1949 local churches were not clearly established in Taiwan, because no elders were appointed prior to this time
After this the Lord's recovery in Taiwan began to take shape; that was more than thirty-five years ago, a third of a century
We must look back and consider those early years in order to learn and to receive practical light instead of being idealistic
If it had not been for the change in the political situation, the church in Shanghai would have been a great success
His visit gave rise to a storm among us, and after that storm, all that we had done from 1949 to 1957 was diluted
We did not overemphasize any point; rather, we paid equal attention to truth, life, the church, and the gospel
When we came to Taiwan, we did not meet only in halls, which were equivalent to what Brother Nee called districts
Due to the constant increase in our numbers, we had to consider how to take care of the new believers who were being added to us
The Lord reminded us of what He had done in the wilderness when He distributed the loaves-He had the people sit down in groups
Based on this principle, we began to further divide the districts into groups, and we met in halls, districts, and groups
In those seven years our numbers increased from five hundred to fifty thousand; that was a hundredfold increase
If we had not changed our direction, we could have gained at least two hundred thousand in the following seven-year periods
If we use this fifty thousand increase as the base, in another seven years we should have gained another fifty thousand
After the Lord brought us to Taiwan, we continued the useful practices and dropped the practices that were not useful
Austin-Sparks because we wanted to receive spiritual help; however, as a result of his visit, our practice was diluted
After 1958 we stopped paying attention to the district meetings, and we did not establish any more district meetings or group meetings
It is an undeniable fact that the way of meeting in halls, districts, and groups is beneficial to the increase of numbers in the church
We have abandoned our strong point, our special skill, which is the practice of meeting in halls, districts, and groups
Although we cannot say with assurance that our condition in life would be better than it is today, we believe that it would not be worse
The same applies to the church life, we dare not say that our condition would be better than it is today, but at least it would not be worse
As soon as we gain people through the gospel, we must bring them to the meetings in the districts and in the groups
We have received over a thousand letters of appreciation from the five continents concerning the Life-study messages
As we have the opportunity, we want to print these letters so that everyone can read the words of appreciation
We have observed that during the past fifty years Christians have begun to treasure the Bible morethey like to read expositions of the Bible
The main direction of our work is to strengthen the truth; the truth among us should surpass our experience in the divine life
Since the time of the apostles, we are probably the only group of believers who practice the church life by meeting in districts
At the time of Pentecost the Lord saved three thousand people in one day through Peter, and on another day He saved five thousand
If we pay attention to education and gaining knowledge at the expense of our physical health, in the end we will have nothing
When their parents were young, their families were very poor, but today these young people have doctoral degrees
If one has descendants, he has hope; having descendants is more beneficial than having a doctoral degree or great wealth
One son of a brother who was a cab driver obtained his doctoral degree in America, and his brother became a medical doctor
If we had continued the work according to our service during the first seven years in Taiwan, our numbers today would be very large
Hong Kong has a population of more than five million people, and the church there has a thirty-five-year history
If the church had continued to increase at the same rate, there would be at least thirty thousand saints in the church in Hong Kong
We need to serve with the truth, the divine life, the church, and the gospel, and we need to meet in halls, districts, and groups
Sometimes, however, the people they sent out would preach the gospel for seven to eight years and gain only five or six people
Many young people have been constrained by the Lord's love, and they desire to be trained and sent out to preach the gospel
There were over a hundred high schools, colleges, and universities, and there were many brothers and sisters in these schools
At present, we do not have even two thousand children in the children's meetings; there may be only five hundred
If we had worked with ten thousand children in 1966, we would have ten thousand young brothers and sisters today
Some may say that our present situation is according to God's will; otherwise, there might be false believers among us
Now we are busy doing our best to preach the gospel, but the number of people we have saved still has not reached six thousand
There may be reasons to continue some of the practices from the past, but why should we continue the things that do not work?
We need a new start with more Christ, more life, more zeal for preaching the gospel, more people, and more open homes
We care for the truth life the church life preaching the gospel and meeting in districts and small groups to gain people and preserve them
At the same time, we cannot have district and group meetings without paying attention to the truth, life, and the church life
We are the Lord's recovery because we have seen the divine revelation of the Body of Christ and the golden lampstands in every locality
The Lord Jesus first gave the loaves to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowd, which was divided into groups
When the Lord Jesus distributed the bread, He did not call a meeting of the board of directors to elect a chairman
The church does not do things in this way; instead, the church makes arrangements according to practical needs
If there were no poor saints, that is, if everyone was moderately well-off, there would have been no need to have all things common
On the day of Pentecost three thousand people were baptized and added to the church, and some among them were poor
The book of Acts does not record how Stephen served tables, but it does record his disputing the truth with the Jews
In those days there were many synagogues in Jerusalem, and one of them was called the synagogue of the Libertines
In Acts 8:5 Philip left Jerusalem and went down to Samaria to preach the gospel, and in 21:8 he is called Philip the evangelist
When the people of Israel were established as a nation, God did not want them to have a king; He did not want them to have organization
When there were problems among them, the high priest would bring the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim into the presence of God
Later the children of Israel followed the custom of the nations and insisted that Samuel appoint a king for them
It was Jehovah who sent Moses and Aaron to lead their fathers out of Egypt; He also saved them out of the hands of their enemies all around
David was not of the tribe of Levi; he was not a priest who was required to wear an ephod or the breastplate, yet he wore a linen ephod
Many think that when the apostles laid their hands upon people at the time of Pentecost, they were setting up an organization
When the pope dies, the cardinals hold an election among themselves to choose the next pope from among themselves
The pope is at the top, the cardinals and archbishops are beneath him, next are the bishops, and under them are priests
It was truly the Lord's leading that in six to seven years we had an increase of one hundred percent; our numbers reached fifty thousand
Our numbers are not even at fifty thousand, because we gave up our initial practice of meeting in districts and groups
Philip's true ministry was that of an evangelist, but when a temporary need arose, he helped with serving tables
On the one hand, we must understand that we do not have organization and that we make arrangements to meet the needs in the church
We are here to experience life; however, in the process of experiencing life, we must coordinate practical matters
Even if a brother is an evangelist, when there is a need, he can serve in the meeting hall and work with electrical equipment
From the speaking of the saints from Taipei, we can see that many of them can quote the Bible and the ministry books
The church in Taipei has two thousand high quality, young working saints between the ages of twenty-five and forty-five
Some brothers say that our low numbers are because some saints passed away, others moved abroad to study, and still others have backslidden
No matter what the excuse may be, we cannot justify our numbers decreasing, instead of increasing, over a period of more than twenty years
These were brothers and sisters who came to Taiwan with government agencies or hospitals; very few saints came on their own
In the seven years after 1949, we went from less than five hundred saints to fifty thousand; this was a hundredfold increase
It is as if for the past eighteen years we have been the only persons in our family, while many other brothers and sisters have left home
We must consider a strategy to bring back the seventeen thousand brothers and sisters who have been absent from the meetings for a long time
In a routine church life we may be very busy but still be unable to bring the seventeen thousand saints back to the church life
We cannot guarantee that all of them will return, but we will be able to recover at least forty percent-that is almost seven thousand saints
If we had had ten thousand children in the children's work, there would be at least five thousand saints in the church life today
Even if only half of the children came into the church life, we would have four to five thousand saints meeting with us
We have about three thousand five hundred saints in the meetings, and of these numbers there are at least one thousand families
At the peak of the campus work at National Taiwan University, we had more than three hundred brothers and sisters on campus
Today, however, we have very few students at National Taiwan University, and we barely have a gospel work there
We must wake up, be sober, and make some changes; otherwise, our capital, our family inheritance, will gradually diminish
According to our statistics from 1949 to 1956 our numbers increased one hundredfold we increased from five hundred saints to fifty thousand
We recently learned that a meeting has been raised up in Burma, and that the saints there are in contact with the saints in Thailand
Last year we felt to begin a Chinese-speaking work because so many brothers and sisters have immigrated to America
People have a high level of education, there are economic resources, transportation is convenient, and public security is good
We have the essential Spirit within us, and we have the economical Spirit upon us; we have the Spirit within and without for our move
If we had continued our initial practice, we would now have over thirty thousand saints actively meeting with us
Answer: It is a terrible thing when a person does not know the flesh, yet he pursues the truth and sees visions
The prerequisite to knowing the truth is to know the flesh, the natural life, and the self and to deal with these things seriously
In pursuing the truth, the younger saints should not begin with studying the twelve precious stones in the New Jerusalem
You should be able to give a clear word concerning justification before you can speak concerning the twelve precious stones
If we think this, can we say that there are forty to fifty saints attending the training who can speak concerning justification?
We still may consider this to be too elementary and instead want to speak on something higher, such as the twelve precious stones
We have to complete elementary school before we can go to junior high school and then high school; otherwise, we will lack a foundation
We teach a little of this here and a little of that there, and this is the reason that it is difficult to have results
Who would have imagined that the population of Taipei would increase, but the number of saints in the church would decrease?
Even though the elders in all the localities have shown some improvement, the overall situation of our work has not improved
At a minimum, we would have a group of 'elementary school graduates' in six years, and we could continue to teach them
We thought that the training in all of its process, arrangement, and pursuit would be like the operation of a school
Few of us can speak concerning the condition of man, but you are eager to speak about the twelve precious stones
For the past twenty-three years we have emphasized giving messages, but we have not paid attention to perfecting the saints
Our work should not merely consist of giving messages that inspire the listeners but do not impart something solid into them
We must teach them sequentially, topic by topic, the basic truths, such as forgiveness, justification, and regeneration
You must graduate from elementary school and secondary school before obtaining a university education; there is no shortcut
If you rely on your cleverness and consider yourself to be an advanced student who can skip grades, you will gain nothing
Question: If we have not graduated from elementary school, is it all right for us to teach at the kindergarten level?
The church has been on the earth for two thousand years, and the study of the Bible has not yet reached that level
You should diligently study the basic truths, such as the condition of man, justification, reconciliation, and sanctification
During the Sino-Japanese War, there was an educator named Chang, who founded Nankai High School and later Nankai University
He realized that the only way to save China was through education; therefore, he carried out an educational work
When we look at the present world situation, how can any country be well-governed without an educational system?
If China had gathered together her talented people to develop a strong educational system, the situation in China today would be strong
After China overthrew the Manchu Dynasty, she was always in the midst of a revolution, and this dragged the country into a state of poverty
The result was that the common people had no way to make a living, and they even lost the opportunity to obtain an education
They should come back to the church with a heart of repentance, and they should cease from their inward struggles
There are almost one hundred churches in Taiwan, which means there is much work that we can do, and this work can be easily accomplished
We should speak the basic truths that bring salvation, such as the condition of man, justification, and forgiveness of sin
If in the future they are able to do a small amount in the work, will they not feel even more strongly that they are excellent?
As long as you have opinions, there is no need for others to abandon you; you have already cast yourself aside
Over the past sixty years the problems that we encountered in the Lord's recovery are the issue of dissent, opposition, and criticism
Opinions are useless, and opposing others is also useless; the only thing that is helpful is to be practical and quiet in our work
It does not matter who speaks eloquently and who does not; the important thing is how much you supply the church
The subjects that we study in school, such as chemistry, physics, mathematics, or geography, do not always relate to our living
When we hear the truth concerning justification, reconciliation, and sanctification, we should ask ourselves whether it is our experience
In our physical life we have been growing since the day we were born, even though we did not feel that we were growing
The experience of life comes mainly from the opening of the truth; it is rare to have growth in life without the opening of the truth
Our experience of life never surpasses our knowledge of the truth; however, our knowledge often surpasses our experience
In the early days all our meetings were small; hardly any locality had more than fifty saints when it was established
Most localities began with ten to twenty saints and then gradually increased, but few localities ever reached one hundred saints
The increase in the number of saints included many brothers and sisters who were restored and also newly saved ones
The larger our numbers the more difficult it is to meet according to the Scriptures it also becomes especially difficult to lead the saints
In 1 Corinthians 14:26 Paul gives the principle that in the meetings each one has a portion with which to supply others
In 2 Timothy 2:2 Paul charges Timothy to commit the things which he had heard to faithful men, who are able to teach others also
We received help from Brother Nee to see that in the New Testament the principle for Christian meetings is the Spirit
When the number of saints meeting in the church in Shanghai was more than one thousand, we had about sixteen districts
In 1959 we had more than forty thousand saints-half of whom were in the church in Taipei-when the dissenting ones began an undermining work
The way to lead the church in Taipei has been a problem for a period of more than twenty years, from 1961 until the present
In other words for over twenty years we have been unable to find a direction for the churches in Taiwan especially for the church in Taipei
We also met in groups based on Mark 6:39-40, where the Lord Jesus asked the five thousand people to sit down in groups
Anyone who has studied the truth will acknowledge that we must consider our situation when we practice the light of the truth
It may be easy when we are training but when we actually get out on the road to drive we need to be able to respond to different situations
It is as if they have a factory, capital, raw materials, a market, and laborers, but they do not know how to manage these resources
There are more than twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, but less than one-fourth of them actually come to the meetings
We need to find every one of the twenty thousand saints in order to understand the reason they are absent from the meetings
Concerning the children's work, out of the twenty thousand saints there should be at least five thousand families
Even though we have fellowshipped repeatedly concerning this, the brothers have not received my words; they have not received this burden
The brothers must consider every saint on our list in prayer in order to know the condition of the saints and of the church in Taipei
We will then know the names of those who have incorrect addresses, those who have passed away, and those who became weak and left the church
There are not many local churches with more than five hundred saints, including the young ones and the elderly
These more than twenty thousand saints must be our goal; we need to consider what meetings can meet their need
After we preach the gospel, we must speak the truth of the gospel; therefore, we need a meeting to teach gospel truths
We need a meeting to edify new believers, a meeting to pursue the truth, and a meeting to pursue the divine life
For this reason, a school has many different classes; all the students are not in one class taking one general course
After we pray about the services, we should assign responsible saints to different services according to the need
All the saints who are in the meetings have received some perfecting, but we must study how we can meet their need
The co-workers and the elders are all faithful, they are willing to give themselves, and they are of the same mind
If we would do this, the Lord will lead us step by step in our prayer and fellowship so that all the needs of the church are met
When the elders and co-workers are in harmony and have one burden but do not have personal views, the practical needs will be met
In addition to finding out why so few saints come to the meetings, we also need to consider different kinds of meetings
It is best to have only one joint meeting every week when the whole church meets together for a corporate leading
We must allow the brothers and sisters to choose meetings for themselves based on their personal situation and need
If we have a meeting only for new believers, the saints who have met with us for twenty to thirty years will not be interested
We could have gained at least twenty-six thousand children, junior high students, high school students, and college students
In our history we have never had a local church with more than three thousand five hundred saints regularly in the meetings
To have only three meetings a week-the prayer meeting, the mid-week ministry meeting, and the Lord's Day meeting-is inadequate
They must continually consider the way to perfect all twenty thousand saints and how to bring the ten thousand children into the church life
We must dream about the children, the junior high students, the high school students, and the college students
In this way the saints in every meeting hall in the church in Taipei will carry out their function to the highest degree
Some people say that they understand the Bible, but they do not know the truth; they have not labored on the truth
We need to know these things, and we also need to experience the truth that Paul preached concerning Christ as the Spirit
The Lord has chosen and called us, but whether or not we will have a future as a Christian depends on our conduct
Answer: We must learn to focus on what we do, and we should not analyze whether or not we are able to accomplish a job
We should not say that the church in Taipei is too large and that we do not know what to do; we simply need to work
If we are asked to speak concerning gospel truths, our speaking should be very clear, attracting, and inspiring
In this way, when people came into the hall, they would have a sense of newness and realize that we had made improvements
We should never think that we would not have the opportunity to manifest our usefulness if we are in a small town
If you are not a co-worker, you can function as a co-worker; if you are not an elder, you can be as capable as an elder
Do not be concerned about whether your locality is small or large, or whether you are a full-timer or a working saint
No matter where we are, we will meet people to whom we can preach the gospel, present the truth, and minister Christ
We cannot deny that their love for the Lord and their spirit for the work exceed our love for the Lord and our spirit for the work
After studying the situation, this brother stood with a sturdy stick behind a door so that the person inside the house could not see him
After he pushed the mill for half a day, they would feel sorry for him and tell their children to give him a cup of water to drink
For our flesh and our self to be dealt with, we must be in the Spirit and take the oneness of the Body as our goal
In conclusion, we must be practical, simple, not express opinions, and take the oneness of the Body as our goal
With regard to the revelation in the New Testament, Paul's ministry is the most important, and John's ministry is the second most important
The believers call themselves the Church of Christ, and they sometimes put up signs that say, No Creed but the Bible
Besides these three groups, we also have no creed but the Bible; thus, we can say that we are the fourth group
Since our beginning, we have repeatedly asserted that we do not care for the creeds, because they are unreliable and incomplete
Of the nine books from Hebrews to Revelation, only 1 John and 1 Peter were formally recognized at the time of the Council of Nicaea
The council did not use the book of Revelation, which contains important matters concerning the revelation of the Trinity
In the Catholic Church some books have been added to the Bible; they are in addition to the sixty-six books of the canon
The Roman Catholic Church is not the only entity that prints Bibles with these fictitious books; the Bible Society also prints these books
Martin Luther had no intention of coming out of the Catholic Church he merely wanted to resolve the matter of absolute obedience to the pope
In Chinese we call these churches 'The Justification-by-faith Church' because Luther was the first person to advocate justification by faith
A priest can rise to become a bishop, a bishop can become an archbishop, and an archbishop can become a cardinal
Of all the religious groups in the world today, the organization of the Roman Catholic Church is the strongest and the strictest
When Luther left the Roman Catholic Church, he was leaving religious hierarchy, but he fell into the organization of the state churches
Every member of the Anglican Church is subordinate to the Queen of England because the Queen of England is the head of the Anglican Church
At that time central Europe was under the control of the Catholic Church, and northern Europe was under the influence of the state churches
The Puritans were also raised up, and were forced to wander from place to place because of the persecution they faced
The believers with Zinzendorf returned to much of the truths in the Bible, and they met according to the Bible
Their knowledge of the truth surpassed Zinzendorf's, and they received clear light regarding the general practices of the church
Because they paid too much attention to doctrines and fell into dead letters, they divided into many different sects
Spurgeon once praised a teacher from the Brethren named William Kelly and said that Kelly's mind was as great as the ocean
During the last half century, Christianity in America has been influenced mainly by the Scofield Reference Bible
Even though these theological seminaries did not take the way of the Brethren, they fully accepted the teachings of the Brethren
Simpson was spiritual, and his messages that contain the basic revelation concerning Christ as our life are well-known
Based on my knowledge and observation, it is hard to find a weighty spiritual book that was published during this period
Not one of these publications is spiritually weighty in scriptural exposition, in the light of the truth, or in the supply of life
A group of scholars have done an excellent work over the past ten years and put out several lexicons for the Greek New Testament
With respect to light, truth, life, and scriptural exposition, the situation in America is just as poor as everywhere else
Recently a very influential Christian publication printed an article that said that the best way to read the Bible is to pray-read it
A book was recently published in Chinese that said that the best way to study the Bible was the 'life-study' method
We also added over two hundred of our own hymns, and we translated approximately thirty hymns from our hymnal in Chinese
We can say that our hymnal in English was a great help in laying a foundation for the Lord's recovery in America
Some Christians say that in the two hundred years of American history they do not know of a collection like it
When we published the hymnal in Chinese, we felt that there was not the same need, so we simply collected more than six hundred hymns
We found a piece of land in Anaheim that was two and a half acres an acre equals 43560 square feet so we had a total of 108900 square feet
3 million dollars in contractors' fees, because brothers from many different localities came and offered their time to build the hall
We built the hall in the first half of 1976, and approximately seventy to eighty brothers offered their time in this way
After we moved to Anaheim, we began to hold two trainings every year, one in the summer and one in the winter, to expound the New Testament
The Recovery Version of the New Testament is not merely a new translation of the New Testament; it also includes rich footnotes
The Life-studies, which are based on the text, footnotes, and cross references of the Recovery Version, were released as messages
We received many riches when Brother Nee was alive, but the light we received in the Life-study messages has become even brighter
The meeting hall in Anaheim is more than twenty-six thousand square feet, and most of the first floor is used by the ministry office
In recent years every aspect of society in Taiwan, including education, the economy, and transportation, has made tremendous progress
Some people may say that since the economy in Taiwan is booming and the standard of living has improved, people may not want the Lord
There are many factors in the environment in Taiwan today that are better for the advance of the Lord's recovery
After the Lord's recovery began in Taiwan in 1949, our numbers increased one hundredfold during the next six or seven years
When Western missionaries came to China to preach the gospel, the Chinese were not widely educated, and they could not understand the truth
The Lord has given Taiwan the top blessing of having a superior education system that has produced many people with graduate degrees
The way of serving the Lord full time is the way of the cross; it is a way that leads to death, a way without any future
In March and April of 1943 seventy brothers and sisters migrated out of Chefoo to Inner Mongolia in the northwestern region of China
The seventy brothers and sisters migrated in March and April of 1943, and by wintertime they had raised up many churches
Later, we lost contact with them because of the changes in the political situation, and we do not know what happened to them
From the East Coast to the West Coast, the situation is very promising even though their numbers are not large
Last year and this year, we had trainings in Germany with more than eight hundred brothers and sisters meeting together
Our books have not only been translated into German, French, and Spanish; they have also been translated into Russian
The Lord arranged for a Russian-speaking Jewish scholar to be a professor at a university near Seattle, Washington
He has doctorate degrees in both Russian and English, and he is happy to help us translate our spiritual publications
He enjoyed reading the books, and he requested that we send them a set of all our publications in Chinese, English, and any other language
We immediately sent him copies of all our publications in Chinese, English, Spanish, Japanese, German, Korean, and even Filipino
In those days there were no Brazilian saints meeting with us; all the saints were Chinese, and the meetings were in Chinese
More than eleven hundred brothers and sisters attended the meetings, and more than one thousand of them were local Brazilians
Before they took the ground, they sent us a letter inviting the brothers and sisters in America to attend their first meeting
It was called Gold Coast when it was a British colony, and it became the Republic of Ghana when it gained its independence
In recent years the Lord's recovery has also gone to the Republic of South Africa, which is on the southernmost tip of Africa
Due to amendments in their constitution, Chinese people there enjoy the same rights and privileges as the Caucasians
These African countries are economically weak, so we have been supplying them with free publications for the past few years
The testimonies in these countries were not raised up by our going there; they were raised up by the publications
The Lord's recovery has been in China for more than sixty years, but there was nothing happening in India or Burma
The first church has been established in Burma, and the church in Bangkok, Thailand has been in contact with them
They are not very clear concerning the way of the church, but he said that they receive much help when they read the Life-study messages
We have also received a letter from another believer based on his writing use of words and his name he is probably a missionary from England
In the southern part of India there is a brother who is a high school teacher, and he is about forty years of age
During the first six or seven years, our numbers increased one hundredfold, from five hundred to fifty thousand
We confess that we have many weaknesses and shortcomings, but our situation is better than the situation of other Christians groups
Because these students do very well in their studies and get excellent grades, they have improved the reputation of the Chinese people
The secondgeneration Chinese children who grew up in America are also top students in elementary school junior high school and high school
By the Lord's mercy, we have been on this island for more than thirty years, and our brothers and sisters are in all levels of society
The brothers and sisters who want to spread the gospel in northern and southern Europe should not be impatient
We must be the Lord's witnesses in Jerusalem and then all of Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost part of the earth
We believe that one hundred saints going to Africa or three hundred going to South America will not be sufficient
Serving the Lord requires time and energy; thus, we need some saints who will offer up their time and their energy
We should not say that when we are full-time serving ones, we are members of the clergy or that we have entered a religious organization
Even though some brothers do not serve full time, we cannot say that they are not co-workers or that they are not in the Lord's recovery
In Acts 18:1-3 when Paul was in Corinth, he remained with them and worked, because their profession was also tent-making
We have fellowshipped in the past about the need for the church in Taipei to produce five hundred serving ones
Some saints are able to offer up all their time, but others cannot give all their time; they can give only part of their time to serve
We have a desire that our university graduates would not work immediately after graduating or upon completing their military service
During these two years they should spend four hours every morning to read the Lifestudy messages and the Recovery Version with the footnotes
We hope that within one year there will be ten thousand children in the children's meetings of the church in Taipei
If the Mormons can gain people for the sake of their religion, should we not do something even higher for the Lord's recovery?
Many brothers and sisters are willing to enter into the burden of the ministry and to go present the truth to others
As soon as we go out to preach the truth, we will immediately realize how short we are and how much we need to continue learning
The brother discovered that there are more than one hundred brothers and sisters working as doctors and nurses in that hospital
If the Catholic Church were in a similar situation, they would have immediately sent a priest and two nuns to take care of that hospital
On the Lord's Day they would hold mass in the hospital, and the priest would take the bread from the mass to every Catholic in the hospital
When the patient in the bed next to a Catholic asks what is happening, the Catholic would answer that his priest is bringing him the mass
In order to go to the many hospitals and the hundreds of schools to properly preach the gospel, we must equip ourselves
When man fell, he not only broke God's law, which is outward, but also received Satan's poison, which is inward
As a result of man's fall, man has both sinful deeds and a sinful nature; his outward deeds are sins, and his inward nature is sin
The blood redeems us from the eternal punishment related to our sins, and the water saves us from the power of sin
The water denotes the Lord's resurrection life, which enters into us and is the power to deliver us from the power of sin
The condemnation here does not refer to being condemned to go to the lake of fire but to the condemning within us
The Lord does not merely forgive us our sins; He also washes away every trace of our sins from us so that it is as if we never sinned at all
Just as in the parable of the prodigal son, He is happy when a son returns home, because the son who was lost has been found
Most believers in Christianity speak only of Gods redemption which is entirely objective and refers to Gods redeeming us through the blood
In this sanctification the Lord does not sanctify us with His blood; rather, He sanctifies us by dispensing His life into us
Every day the Lord supplies us with a new element, and this new element metabolically discharges the old elements within us
A person with a bad temper should not try to change it, because the more he tries to suppress his temper, the worse it will become
The Lord Jesus said that He was the bread of life which came down from heaven and that those who eat Him will live because of Him
When we eat Him, we will be supplied inwardly; we will receive a new element that will metabolically discharge our old elements
God does not merely want to regenerate us sanctify us and renew us He also wants to transform us conform us and in the end to glorify us
On the one hand, He is growing within us, and on the other hand, He is sanctifying, renewing, and transforming us
In addition to studying the Life-study messages and the basic truths, we must study some important terms in the Lord's recovery
When the Lord Jesus came He was the Son of God who was sent by God and who came from God however He also brought the sending Father with Him
In the Gospel of John the Lord Jesus repeatedly said that the Father was with Him and that the Father never left Him
Modalism annuls the distinction between the Father and the Son by saying that the Father and the Son are one entity
In the table of contents of our hymnal, under the category 'Praise of the Lord' there is a sub-category 'His All-inclusiveness'
We need to know Christ not only in His love His grace His light and His power we should also know His allinclusiveness and His unlimitedness
Even if we were to give ten million messages on the riches of Christ, we would not be able to exhaust the riches of Christ
Those who are not saved do not know what Christians or believers are, and even the believers do not know what they themselves are
The local churches will be brightly shining golden lampstands, preaching the gospel on the one hand and teaching the truth on the other
We believe that the church is the Body of Christ and that every believer as a member of the Body is able to function
You are walking in the way of wickedness and snares; / Why don't you turn back before you fall into the abyss'?
After they finish singing, they can tell them, 'Do you not see that you are like a fish or a bird caught in a net?
The Gospel of John and the book of Colossians are two books in the Bible that speak of Christ as life in a clear and definite way
When we consider our history, we see that, according to scriptural principles, the Lord has led us along a comprehensive path
Christians throughout the centuries, especially Christian leaders, have been prone to make the mistake of not being multifaceted
Christians can be compared to the four living creatures; they have the aspect of being a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle
Some Christians, however, emphasize only the aspect of being a man, and they kick aside the lion, slaughter the ox, and chase away the eagle
The purpose of these events in our history was for no other reason than to allow us to see light and to learn many lessons
Many of the problems that we have experienced in our history were because some of the brothers did not have the view of being multifaceted
The man, the lion, the ox, and the eagle are all present, but they do not have any problems, because Christ is the center
If you read the outlines of the trainings, you will see four main points: truth, life, the church, and the gospel
The four items-truth, life, the church, and the gospel-may be likened to a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle, and Christ is their center
There is a problem with the character of the Chinese, which is that they seem very soft, but they are very hard
When the older ones come together, they may say that there is nothing that they can do with the young people because they are so young
When the young people get together, they may complain that there is nothing they can do with the older saints because they are so old
The older saints have no way with the younger ones, and the younger saints will not go to fellowship with the older ones
After the meeting, the older saints gather with other older saints, and the younger saints want to be with other young saints
Even though the young people have a heart to serve full time, they must pay attention to being multifaceted in their practice
Just as a country needs strong young men when it goes to war, the church also needs strong young ones for it to spread
As long as we pray more and exercise our spirit more, we will go forward together step by step, and the church will have a bright future
He made some of us shy and some of us bold so that we could be multifaceted-able to take care of every situation
Not only should they understand the truth, but they should also be able to use simple words to teach others the truth
In the same way, if there is no life, we have no reality when we preach the gospel, and our speaking will merely be doctrine
We should not emphasize life and neglect preaching the gospel, nor should we overemphasize the gospel and neglect life
We must remember that Christ is our portion, He is the mystery of God, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily
If we fellowship with Christ, we will discover that ninety percent of the time we do not take Christ as our base
On the surface some ancient teachings and family traditions appear to be the same as Christian teachings, but they are not Christ
He is all-inclusive, He is the embodiment of God, and He is our God-allotted inheritance, so we should enjoy Him every day
When everyone grows, the issue is the Body of Christ, which is Christ's household and God's temple, the church
In 1966 there were many junior high school and high school students, in their uniforms, in the audience of a large gospel meeting
If a teacher has thirty students and is able to bring onethird of them to salvation every year by the end of seven years many will be saved
Every saint who is a teacher should not only learn how to educate his students; he should also learn how to gain them
If we are faithful to practice this, after seven to ten years, we will gain one million people in the Lord's recovery
The Lord's recovery is multifaceted, and it requires us to care for the truth, life, the church, and the gospel
Concerning the preaching of the gospel there are three basic requirements being beside ourselves being thickskinned and opening our homes
Romans 65 says If we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection
There are some things that are right in traditional theology, but within those items there is always some hidden error, which is leaven
If we sing this hymn repeatedly, everyone will set their will to 'live for Christ' and 'follow His leading and give Him my all'
When we feel that we are corrupted and sinful, we offer the Lord Jesus as our sin offering or as our trespass offering
Chapter 6 then speaks of our death and resurrection with Christ-we are not the old 'I' but the resurrected 'I'
Chapter 8 says that the Holy Spirit is in us and that the work of the Holy Spirit is to sanctify, renew, and transform us
We do not put to death only the evil practices of the body; we need to put to death all the practices of the body
The apostle Paul's word says, 'The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died'
To live for Jesus' is an awful thing, and it is a suffering, but 'to live is Jesus' is an enjoyment without suffering
Living for Jesus gives people the wrong understanding and makes them think that they have to do something in themselves for the Lord
In reality, however, He does not want us to do so many things for Him; He wants us to simply let Him live out of us
The I, the self, in this hymn does not refer to the body but to the person, which is our natural I, the soul-life
According to what is written in Romans 6, when we present our bodies to be under His direction, we are offering our members to God
One of the problems in Christianity is that before believers give themselves to God, they do not have many difficulties
As soon as they consecrate themselves to God, they have problems that result in divisions and produce many sects
If we do this, we will fall into trouble, and after ten years the full-time serving ones would be divided into five or six different groups
Every way that we take in resurrection is a living way with a tremendous future because Christ is living in us
Those who have been called by the Lord to serve Him full time for their entire lives have a wonderful testimony
When he returned to Taipei, he fellowshipped with a second brother, and the two decided to invite the young brothers to Taipei
Several of the famous Chinese preachers were with us for a time and then turned away to establish their own work
You must adhere to the one principle of not doing any other work and not using gimmicks in the Lord's recovery
We must always remember this principle: we are here only to labor and to expend our energy in the Lord's recovery to build up His Body
We want to explain this matter clearly to the young people because we hope that you will not have ambitions or great aims
In the New Testament there are three designations for the church: the church of God , the church of Christ , and the church of the saints
The church belongs to the saints, and we should only take the position of being one of the many saints enjoying the church
Acts 542 says Every day in the temple and from house to house they did not cease teaching and announcing the gospel of Jesus as the Christ
Later when we came to Taiwan the number of saints increased rapidly and it was not enough to divide into homes we also had to have groups
The practice of meeting in groups is based on the record in Luke 9 where the Lord fed five thousand people with five loaves and two fish
When the church in Taipei first began to practice meeting in groups, there were not many saints in each group; there were only about twenty
According to the Bible, twelve people can be considered a group, because the first group of early disciples was the twelve apostles
There are about fifteen thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and about five thousand of these meet regularly
The groups should not be formed according to the spiritual level of the saints but according to their residential location
Every brother and sister opened his or her home for the preaching of the gospel, and they invited their relatives, friends, and neighbors
At this point we must commend the sisters, because the gospel in the homes is built on the sisters for the following reasons
The brothers are busier during the day because they go out to work; their hearts are not necessarily concerned with the homes
The Bible records two instances of sisters anointing the Lord with fragrant ointment one is in Luke 73639 and the other is in Matthew 26613
We must emphasize the function of the sisters in promoting the preaching of the gospel in the homes until every home is open for the gospel
The brothers who serve with the name lists of those in the church should tell us how many household units there are
If the church in Taipei has twelve hundred households, it means that there are twelve hundred gospel stations in the church
There should not be more than twelve children in a class, and they can have three high school sisters or brothers as their teachers
The full-time co-workers should promote this work, prepare the teaching materials, and take care of all the other matters
Every children's home meeting should frequently preach the gospel and invite their relatives and the children of their neighbors
Apart from these ways to preach the gospel, we must use the small groups to recover the dormant brothers and sisters
We must change our concepts and not think that a 'spiritual' household will be more effective in preaching the gospel
Of course, we are not saying that the saints should not be spiritual, nor are we encouraging the saints to love the world
We should not measure the heart or the appearance of the saints to determine whether their household is qualified to preach the gospel
The New Testament shows that the gospel was preached in the homes of sinners and in the homes of God-fearing people
It does not matter whether a person is experienced; as long as he is saved, he should open his home for the preaching of the gospel
We simply need to bear the responsibility of opening our homes and inviting our relatives, neighbors, and friends
When the saints come together, they must practice speaking for the Lord by giving testimonies of how they were saved
Because believers in Christianity follow the customs of the nations, they cannot avoid the rituals in worship services
True worship is to use our spirit to receive the Lord as life, to eat the bread of life, and to drink the water of life
In the past many Christians thought that breaking bread to remember the Lord was to meditate quietly upon all that the Lord passed through
To remember the Lord we must know that He is the bread of life and then take and eat Him in true remembrance of Him
In promoting the home gospel meetings, we do not want to give the saints a natural understanding or a religious concept
For many years the number of saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei has been around four to five thousand
The spiritual life of the saints has been maintained through their meeting regularly, and they have grown in life
Many brothers and sisters are growing, and many new brothers and sisters are being brought into the church life
If we want to gain people, we all, including the older and the younger saints, must rise up and coordinate together
After children are born, we cannot discard them on the side of the road, nor can we abandon them in a nursery school
Nearly all young females receive a good education, one that is not inferior to the education received by males
He will also be able to beget, nourish, teach, and administrate, and we will be able to continue to gain new ones
Some brothers refuse to be an elder or a deacon, one who takes care of the saints and bears responsibility in the church
From our experience we know that begetting is easy, but nourishing, teaching, and administrating are not so easy
We must care for the people whom we beget through preaching the gospel, and we must nourish and teach them in order for them to be sustained
If we follow the way of the world, we could support, cultivate, and administrate through organization, but the church is not an organization
We cannot lead people to salvation and then rely on the full-timers or co-workers and elders to support, cultivate, and care for them
If we can lead five people to salvation in a year, that is the Lord's mercy; however, we must support them after they are saved
Preaching the gospel requires labor-reading the Bible and studying the truth, including the Life-study messages
It does not matter what kind of attitude others have toward us or in what way they speak to us, we should always be rooted in Christ
We must watch to see that the saints are clear concerning the truth, that they are strong in life, and that they have a normal church life
In addition, it should not be too difficult to have two evening meetings during the remaining six days in the week
We have considered combining the Lord's Day morning meeting with the table meeting, but it is not so easy to combine them
In addition to the two Lord's Day meetings, during the week there is the need for a prayer meeting and for a meeting to study the Bible
Attending these four meetings can be compared to eating regular meals instead of starving oneself and then eating a huge meal
In the future the fulltime coworkers will encourage preaching the gospel on the campuses in the homes to the children and in the community
Full-timers are needed for the gospel on the campuses and in the schools; otherwise, it will be difficult to maintain the gospel work
The number of children in the church in Taipei has dropped to five hundred because there is a lack of co-workers to carry the work forward
In this way, the church will be built up, and the Lord will have a testimony on the earth that will cause the bride to be prepared
We believe that the words in the Bible, regardless of how deep, high, or mysterious they are, will be fulfilled
If we are not willing to cooperate with the Lord to allow His words to be accomplished in us in this age, He will delay His return
To the Lord one thousand years are as a day; if He delays his coming for one thousand years, He will come one day later
We believe that this is what the Lord wants us to do and we also believe that if we are faithful the Lords grace will take us on in this way
When we go out to preach the gospel, we should not think that we are great gospel preachers who can bring one hundred people to salvation
We will not suffer nor will we be in any danger when we go out to preach the gospel even if we lead tens of thousands of people to salvation
Do not say that Apollos is higher than Paul or that Paul is deeper than Peter or even that Peter is older and more experienced
If we say that we are following the way of Paul or that we belong to Peter or to Apollos, we have brought division into the church
Rather, we are for the Lord's recovery, and we love the Lord's recovery, all the churches, and all the brothers and sisters
The Lord has given us a portion, which we must take care of, but we must not push others aside or trample on their portion
We must remember that the Lord has richly given every member to the church and that every member has the Lord's riches
If we want the church to continue to spread, every saint must pick up the responsibility to shepherd and teach
We will form small groups in every district, and every group will have twelve people, just as the Lord Jesus had twelve disciples
On the one hand, we will preach the gospel, and on the other hand, we will take care of the saints by feeding them as our spiritual children
The goal of leading people to salvation is to bring them into the church so that they will be established in the church
If we do not support them, we will lead people to salvation with one hand and allow them to slip away through our other hand
Hymn 212 in the Chinese hymnal was written after we had a thorough study of Ezekiel 1 more than twenty-three years ago
John Nelson Darby says that the electrum is 'an unknown substance' that 'some think a mixture of gold and silver'
According to church history, for the past five hundred years the Protestant churches have been maintained mainly by revival meetings
For this meeting, there is one sentence that we can use: 'O Jehovah, revive Your work / In the midst of the years'
Hymns, 797 is also very appropriate, because the beginning of every stanza and the beginning of the chorus say, 'Revive Thy work, O Lord'!
According to the record in Acts, one hundred twenty disciples prayed in one accord in the upper room for ten days
On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit was poured out, and three thousand people heard the gospel and were saved
It is difficult to know how to build up a local church that has a large number of saints and how to spread in such a local church
There were eleven of us at our first bread-breaking meeting, and we sat around an old-fashioned Chinese square table
The number of new believers we would baptize never exceeded forty at one time; at the most there were thirty-seven or thirty-eight
As soon as we began to practice the whole church preaching the gospel, the number of saved ones increased greatly
During the second year of the whole church preaching the gospel, we received a great blessing-many were baptized
After the church in Chefoo was raised up in 1932, our numbers increased to over a hundred saints in the second year
Since some of the brothers and sisters lived in the northwest district of the city, there was the need to meet in two places
The church in Shanghai had to temporarily close its doors and stop meeting because Shanghai was occupied by the Japanese army
The church preached the gospel during the Chinese New Year holiday, and more than one hundred people were baptized
Due to the political situation, from 1942 to 1946 the doors to the meeting hall were closed, and the saints were unable to meet
The full-time serving ones spread to these localities to care for the churches for the furtherance of the Lord's work
At the time of our increase in numbers we wanted to receive help in order to pursue spiritual growth, so we invited Brother T
As a result of the influence from Brother Sparks, several young brothers had a change of heart and began to dissent
It has been approximately twenty-seven years since that storm, but our numbers have not increased; they have remained stagnant
We became distracted by Brother Sparks's visit and no longer paid attention to the service in the districts and in the small groups
According to our rearrangement, the church in Taipei had more than twenty districts, but there were no more small groups
As a result, our care for the brothers and sisters, especially our cherishing of the new ones, was not as effective
According to the reports they gave me, we had names and addresses for about twenty-three thousand saints in the church in Taipei
Over the intervening years, the population and territory of Taipei changed considerably, and many streets and addresses changed
According to my observation, the main reason for the decrease in number is that we lost our leading at the basic level
Even though the church in Taipei has not increased in numbers for more than twenty years, the church has been growing in life
The level of education in the city is relatively high; hence, most of the saints have a higher education and are quite capable
The church in Taipei has more than eleven thousand saints, but only four to five thousand attend the meetings regularly
The church in Taipei has five thousand saints who meet regularly and over eleven thousand saints on its name list
According to our consideration, two hundred full-timers plus three hundred part-timers would be equivalent to five hundred serving ones
There were five thousand men, not including women and children, so there must have been more than ten thousand people
The people were on a mountain out in the wilderness, and there was a possibility that many would have been trampled in a rush for the food
Before distributing the food the Lord Jesus in His wisdom told the disciples to have everyone sit down in groups by hundreds and by fifties
If they had been standing, it would have been easy for them to move around, but since they were sitting, they remained in one place
We are going to practice the small groups according to the Bible, and we will have twelve or less saints in every group
The four to five thousand saints meeting regularly in the church in Taipei have been divided into more than four hundred small groups
In another sense someone is taking the lead because everyone is a coordinator everyone is a responsible one and everyone is a group leader
From our experience, we discovered that appointing group leaders has drawbacks; therefore, the groups will not have leaders
In the past, those who were appointed as leaders or as responsible ones felt as though they were a government official
Everyone is a group coordinator and everyone is a group leader; no one can escape responsibility, and no one can condemn anyone else
If someone stumbles, everyone must bear the responsibility to support that saint; no one should push aside the responsibility
Regardless of whether you are a small brother or a small sister, you are a group coordinator, and this is good
If you do not have enough chairs in your home, you should not be troubled; it is all right for the saints to sit on the floor
The homes in Taiwan are all very elegant, even the floors are very clean, so it is not bad for saints to sit on the floor
If every home takes turns to have the meeting, everyone will bear responsibility, and the small groups will be a success
The church in Taipei of approximately six hundred saints has been formed into districts by joining fifty or so small groups together
Before the full-time co-workers encourage the saints to be in the group meetings, there is a need for training
We need to train the saints in such things as how to use the Bible, how to speak the word, and how to care for people
These co-workers must serve full time; otherwise, they will not have the time to encourage the saints to practice the group meetings
In todays society people who work for corporations must be competitive and do their best to improve otherwise they will not have a future
Those who are employed by contract must produce results; otherwise, when their contract expires, their employer will not hire them again
The ones preparing to serve full time must be trained, and after they have served for some time, they should be tested
Two to three hundred full-timers might not be enough to encourage the saints who meet regularly in the church in Taipei to function
Other dormant brothers and sisters live near group 9, so the brothers and sisters of that group should take care of them
We cannot rely merely on the brothers and sisters in the groups to take care of this; we must also depend on the full-time co-workers
The co-workers should encourage the brothers and sisters to find the time and the way to recover the dormant saints
If we can work on recovering the ones at home, we will be able to recover at least three thousand saints by next summer
We might not be able to recover one hundred percent of the dormant ones, but we should be able to recover two-thirds of them
The full-time co-workers should help the saints to encourage the dormant ones to open their homes for the gospel
According to my experience and observation, the best way to recover a dormant saint is to preach the gospel in his home
Once he starts to speak, he might become more fervent, and he may even shed tears as he speaks of the Lord's grace to him
After he speaks such a word, he will not be able to sleep at night, and the wind, the cloud, the fire, and the electrum will come to him
When the wind and the cloud come, he will become a 'man of wind and cloud,' and his home will become a 'home of wind and cloud'
If we will be earnest in having the dormant saints preach the gospel, at least seventy percent of them will be recovered
When we go to recover the dormant households, we should not speak to the brothers, because they have their dignity
We should not be afraid as long as we have faith and boldly go through the door of the sisters we will be able to gain the dormant household
The parents will not follow the children to do evil things, but when the children do something positive, the parents will follow them
If the children are recovered, the father will consider the effect that his not being in the meetings has had on his children
He will be encouraged to meet with the saints since his children have been blessed and God has shown mercy on his household
The full-time co-workers must be trained, and they must pray much when they go to help the saints enter into their function
The co-workers must pray for more than half an hour every day; it is best if they can pray for an hour or more every day
We need to pray desperately for every family that we are responsible for, and we must pray for every saint by name
After your parents believe, and you go to them with words of building up, encouragement, and comfort, you are a prophet
When you are sent to preach the gospel, you are an apostle; when you prophesy for the Lord to encourage others, you are a prophet
Since Christians have completely lost this matter, they think that they are not apostles or prophets or teachers
A Christian who graduates from seminary and who is hired by a congregation to be their pastor and preacher does everything
Even though the churches abroad speak highly of the church in Taipei, the church in Taipei is not yet up to the standard
It has a convenient transportation system, a highly educated populace, sufficient economic strength, and good public security
One day as he was getting ready for bed, he suddenly remembered that he had not preached the gospel to anyone that day
It was the middle of the night, and he could not find anyone except for a policeman standing at the street corner
Lord, take us forward to pray for Your churches and for all the saints so that none of us would miss Your grace or lose Your presence
We testify to the universe that we are one spirit with the crucified, resurrected, ascended, and reigning Christ
Lord, supply us with grace every minute and every second so that we can live You every day to be Your testimony on this island
We praise You as the essential Spirit who transforms us inwardly and as the economical Spirit who anoints us without
Lord, You charged us to go to disciple all the nations because all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to You
We look to the Lord's grace to lead us in life and to cause us to rise up corporately so that every household would be for the gospel
There are also many brothers and sisters who are on these campuses either as students or as teachers and professors
The educational system cares only for the soul within man, paying particular attention to the mind within the soul
If they never receive the Lord's gospel or hear the Lord's truth, the center of their human existence will not be strong
We would welcome any young saint, especially between the ages of twenty and thirty-five, who can join the campus work
On the other hand, they will spend time in the afternoons to pray and to contact people for the gospel, especially on the campuses
In order to advance the campus work, we will also need some experienced co-workers to take the lead in the campus work
We worship the Lord that the environment and situation on the island of Taiwan are favorable to the campus gospel work
There are nearly six hundred brothers and sisters all over Taiwan who have decided to serve the Lord full time
Among the saints in Taipei there are at least several thousand household units, and all of these households have children
There are also many children in the households of our neighbors, friends, relatives, colleagues, and classmates
The inhabitants of this island would be happy for their children to know the Lord's truth and gain genuine benefits
We might have only one thousand children, but we hope that after one year or less we can have five thousand children
Upon their graduation from college, they will be a group of young Christians who are cultivated in and equipped with the truth
If we have them on Saturday or any other day of the week, every district will have many homes for the children's meetings every week
If there are two hundred fifty meetings we immediately need seven hundred fifty collegeage brothers and sisters to bear this responsibility
The community gospel is another great work that requires the help of the full-time co-workers to promote it and to be involved in it
Through the small groups we will recover the dormant saints and preach the gospel in the community from house to house
The full-timers and all the saints in all the churches in the Lord's recovery need to give themselves to be equipped with the truth
The Recovery Version of the New Testament in Chinese with footnotes and cross references will soon be ready for publication
We should have a Life-study and the Recovery Version of the New Testament in our hands at all times and in all places
We have spent eleven years speaking on all twenty-seven books of the New Testament in the summer and winter trainings
If we cannot find two hours during the day, then we should spend one hour a day and complete the New Testament in eight years
In Ephesians 1:13 Paul says, 'In whom you also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation'
If we carefully read the book of Romans, we will see that Romans 1 speaks of sinners, who are wicked, dark, defiled, and vicious
In this book of the gospel, Paul speaks of the church in Cenchrea and highly recommends a sister named Phoebe, who was a deaconess there
When they were in Rome the church that was there met in their home and when they were in Ephesus the church that was there met in their home
Paul says that this couple risked their necks for his life, and that he and all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks to them
When we compare the book of Romans to the gospel preached by most believers in Christianity, we see that there is a great contrast
The gospel preached by Christians today is either concerning escaping hell and going to heaven or concerning material blessings
If we can speak logically and clearly, we will bring the heavens to the earth and the earth into the heavens, and they will be moved
When we preached the gospel in the past, we told people that if they believed in Jesus, they would go to heaven
When a person's business was not going well, we would tell his entire family to believe in Jesus so that his business would do better
We would also tell a family that if they believed in Jesus and prayed to Him daily, their children would get into the best university
When they open their mouths, the truth will flow out, and when they go out to preach the gospel, they will speak the truth
When we understand the truth, we should discuss the truth with other saints instead of talking about the weather and politics
We should be steeped in the truth and equipped with the truth to the extent that we breathe the truth, eat the truth, and live the truth
Our entire being should be full of the truth, and our conversation with other saints should be nothing other than the truth
After a period of time, they will understand what they could not receive at first, and the truth will enter into them
America has many immigrant Chinese families with elderly men and women who did not understand English when they immigrated
Since their grandchildren speak English, the grandparents gradually learn to speak English, because they hear it every day
Every family and every saint must get into the Recovery Version of the New Testament to equip themselves with the truth
Some of us must work in a profession, as nurses, doctors, teachers, professors, or clerks, to earn a living and support our families
The brothers and sisters who have a heart for the full-time serving ones can give their offerings to the church in their locality
Even if it is not indicated on an envelope, the church can use the offering to take care of the full-time serving ones
There will also be more saints encouraging the various activities of the church, and their work will produce results
They must also observe how society is developing and note the locations that will be suitable for meeting halls
If we live in a city, we give our offerings to the church in that city, and the church will distribute the offerings
Most of the offerings will be used to support the full-timers, to spread the gospel, and to build meeting halls
If the churches in a country cannot use all the offerings they receive, they can care for the churches in other countries
If we rise up, then after five to ten years we will be able to praise the Lord, and the condition of the churches will be clearly manifested
Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being for choosing us before the foundation of the world and for setting us apart
We need Your Spirit in us to daily give us the light from heaven, the light in the Holy Place, and even the revelation in the Holy of Holies
You are mingled with us; divinity is mingled with humanity, and the human spirit is joined to the divine Spirit
Not remaining in oldness means that we do not remain in anything apart from the Lord, regardless of whether it is good or bad
If we insist on keeping our former understanding of the Bible, we will remain in oldness, and God's light cannot enter into our being
We should never think that only the elderly saints have old and stale things within them; even the younger saints have old things
There are many sisters in every locality, but who can say with confidence that she is in one accord with another sister?
Some saints have served the Lord full time for many years, but it is still difficult for them to be in one accord
In these thirteen chapters of the Bible, we must find and study the crucial points concerning those who serve the Lord
These three books speak about the different conditions of the Lord's serving ones and give us the pattern of a serving one
We should never give people the impression that we are dishonorable or that we do not keep our word or that we do not regard contracts
Suppose a brother is thirtyfive years old and has only a high school education but he is an electrician and his business is very successful
If he were to give up his profession, he would eventually become a burden to the church related to his support
It would be more profitable for this brother to remain in his profession and use his job as an opportunity to preach the gospel to people
We must encourage them to use their businesses as an opportunity to contact people, to preach the gospel, and to lead people to salvation
As a result, her husband came to the meeting hall and complained about her, saying, 'What are you doing in this church?
In 1938 there was a sister in Chefoo who was so zealous in serving full time that she did not even stop to eat
Paul says, 'We exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men'
In Taiwan the term full-time serving one became so prevalent that the full-time serving ones were considered a special class of saints
Brother Nee once said that serving the Lord is our primary profession and that our job is our secondary profession
Christianity is an organized religion, and the assignments in Christianity are often made by a centralized committee
After they are approved and assigned to the work, the leading brothers might discover that they do not need so many serving ones
We should not forget that in our natural man, we are all like politicians who set their heart to grasp power and rule over others
We should not think that the full-time serving ones produced by a church should necessarily stay in that church
Neither should we think that a church that produces only a few full-time serving ones is deserving of its lack
His placement in the work should be decided in the fellowship of the Body and according to the Lord's leading within him
We can testify that those who tried to keep some extra glory in their locality found that it did not last long
The serving ones whom they vie for are like the night-blooming cereus flowers that bloom only at midnight and wilt before dawn
Even if we have many flowers, they are like the night-blooming cereus flowers that fade and wilt in a very short time
After the groups are formed, the full-time and part-time serving ones should be assigned to care for the groups
The groups should be formed according to where the saints live, and there should not be group leaders or coordinators
The saints in a group should live near one another, and one full-time or part-time serving one should be responsible for helping them
The elders should take care of the administration of the entire church, and a few co-workers should take the lead in the districts
Concerning the campus work, we must consider how many campuses in a locality are ready for the serving ones and how many campuses are not
Every locality must be aggressive in the children's work, because there is a greater future in the children's work than in the campus work
When we preach the gospel, we frequently have to go out to gain people; we even go to the campuses to gain people
Every local church must do its best to form small groups, begin the campus work, and develop the children's work
If this brothers spiritual function clearly manifests that he should serve the Lord full time then he should become a fulltime serving one
The young people must learn to speak and write in both Chinese and English, because English is an international language
Answer: These matters require us to go before the Lord and then make decisions according to the situation in our locality
Question: What should we do about a saint who is individualistic and has a peculiar disposition, yet he wants to serve the Lord full time?
He should not be perceived as a brother from Taiwan; otherwise, he will be like a butterfly instead of a honeybee
In the Lord's recovery, especially in our training, we are all honeybees, despite the fact that we are of different nationalities
For this reason, the responsible brothers in every locality must spend time and effort to labor on brothers who are individualistic
Serving full time should not interrupt a marriage, nor should it affect a sister's place as a wife and a mother
If her mother and mother-in-law cannot help her children with their homework, then this sister must help her children
She must not say that she has to help her children with their homework and therefore has no time to pursue the Lord
For the sake of coordinating with the brothers and sisters, we should take care of their feelings and do things properly
No matter how much we love the Lord or how spiritual we are, we are still people in the flesh, and our living is in the physical realm
The full-time serving ones must also advance the gospel in the community through the brothers and sisters at all levels of society
The saved ones in Christian groups are also in the Lord and are brothers and sisters, but we are not meeting with them
When the Lord raised up His recovery in China, the first thing we emphasized was the recovery of the practices in the Scriptures
Regrettably, we have observed that even among us, most brothers and sisters rely on the elders as if they were pastors
Suppose a sister follows her so-called sense of life, or the anointing of the Spirit, and goes to serve in Kaohsiung
Although the church in Kaohsiung may acknowledge her burden and allow her to serve on the campus, they may feel that there was no fellowship
They may feel that she is able to carry out a spiritual function, but that she is unable to carry out any practical service
On the other hand, we are extremely limited in what we can do in the service and must rely on and enjoy the service of other saints
The elders should ask themselves whether they are a part of an organism or an organization inside the organism
The Bible never says that the church is the church of the elders, nor does it say that the church is the church of the apostles
The important point here is that the New Testament does not have the thought that the elders are lords over the church
If your husbands were not elders, you would not be slave-ladies, but once your husbands became elders, you became slave-ladies'
We must always remember that an elder is not the owner of a church or a superior official; he is just one sheep among the flock
An elder is an elder because he obeys the Lord; he grazes when he should graze and drinks when he should drink
He grazes when it is time to graze, he drinks when it is time to drink, and he is more obedient than the other sheep
Peter seemed to be saying, 'It is true that the elders should not lord it over you, but they are patterns of the flock
In other words, the younger sheep must obey the older sheep, and the older sheep must listen to the younger sheep
If this were the case, kings would lose their status and position; they would be on the same level as everyone else
It seems that Paul considers the service of the deacons to be higher than that of the elders, so he placed the elders after the deacons
According to 1 Corinthians 12:28, the first three gifts established by God are apostles, prophets, and teachers
Today's Pentecostal movement promotes the gift of healing, but it disregards prophesying and teaching the Bible
If the formal approval of the elders is not a condition for full-time service, some elders might ask why their consideration is needed
If the elders have a proper understanding, they will follow their inward sense and the anointing of the Spirit
If they stand on the ground of organization and serve as elders with an organizational view, they are part of an organization
An elder who functions in an organic way will be in fear and trembling as he considers whether a saint should serve full time
We need to be in fear and trembling; otherwise, we will not pay attention to the Spirit's operating, and we will make our own decisions
We must ask ourselves how many times during the day do we obey the sense of life and the anointing of the Spirit
The Bible does not command the wives to love their husbands, because God knows that the wives love their husbands
Even though the wives love their husbands, the main problem with wives is that they do not submit to their husbands
The greatest danger in the elders' administration of the church is not administrating according to the operating of the Spirit
It may be that only a few of their decisions related to the administration of the church are according to the operation of the Spirit
Nearly every elder feels that he understands the truth and has clear insight; therefore, he is strict to carry things out
We should be clear that if we do not carry things out according to the truth, we are not obeying the operation of the Spirit
In other words, we are concerned that the elders will not follow the Spirit but will merely consider outward qualifications
For the past two thousand years this problem has caused the church to not grow much and to not be useful to the Lord
Our consideration of those who wish to serve full time must not be based on what is good or bad or on who is qualified or not qualified
We must be fearful before the Lord and learn to follow the Spirit by obeying the anointing and the sense of life
When we asked the elders in every locality to consider those who desire to serve full time, we did not use the word examine
In America marriage is one of the most popular topics, but the more it is discussed, the more people get divorced
There might be disputes concerning who should decide matters, when to visit the saints and when the meetings should be held
The elders must be in fear and trembling before the Lord and follow the leading of the Spirit to help the young people in life
It might be his excitement and not the anointing, or it might be his impulse and not the operation of the Spirit
When there is fellowship, the elders should not act as if they are sitting on thrones to issue edicts and quick decisions
If a saint is not in spirit, and the elders act like government officials, then fellowship with the elders will be without effect
The full-timers must learn the sense of life and obey the anointing, and they must learn to fellowship with the elders
We should never consider that being an elder means that the saints need our approval to determine whether or not they can serve
Some elders are proud; they think that no one can serve without their approval and that not listening to them is to not listen to the church
Although a young saint loves the Lord with a pure heart and wants to serve Him full time, his present sense may not be entirely accurate
If he disobeys the elders and insists on going to the campus to serve, the organic nature of the Body will be damaged
We might be able to accomplish things by taking the way of organization, but we will lose the testimony of the Lord's recovery
Suppose for example every saint in the church in Kaohsiung is exercising to live in the spirit and the church in Taipei lacks serving ones
Even if we had the leading of the Spirit in the past, we dare not assume that the Spirit is still operating in the same way
The elders who are gentle and do things in a refined manner are troubled by saints who are impatient and quick
The church in Taipei might not ask for additional serving ones, and the elders in Kaohsiung might not feel to send anyone to Taipei
Even if your elders are willing to send you to Taipei the saints serving on the campus there might not want fulltimers from other localities
Such a group might accept only those who were raised up locally, because they have their local way of doing things
The local saints should be careful not to refuse anyone who comes to serve, because we are all in one Body bearing the same testimony
Just as our physical body can become infected with many illnesses, so the Body of Christ can also have different kinds of sicknesses
The burden of this message is to have special fellowship concerning the organic function of the Body of Christ
People began to consider the church as an organization, that is, a group of people who gather together to take certain actions
The Catholic Church has highly elevated such representatives to be not only representatives of Christ but also to be fathers to the church
The Roman Catholic Church says that Peter was the first representative and that after Peter there have been popes throughout the centuries
Originally, the Protestant Reformation wanted to overthrow only the heretical teachings in the Catholic Church
Throughout the centuries, the Lord's serving ones have confronted the question of whether the church is an organization or a Body
A professor knows that he should listen to the dean, but many saints who are serving full time do not know to whom they should submit
If this question concerning being organic and being organizational is not resolved we will have no way to go on and no way to make decisions
We all have many theories concerning being organic and being organizational, but we are not clear in our practice
In theory we know that to serve full time is to live before the Lord and to let the Lord's life live out of us
We also know that the Body of Christ is living, that all the members must function, and that every part must be living
To be organic the elders should not have the sense that they are elders nor should they stand on their position as elders to make decisions
They should not have the slightest thought that their decisions are supported merely by the fact that they are elders
Once we act, speak, and handle matters according to the position, name, and status of being elders, we fall into organization
A young sister who desires to serve the Lord full time might think that she should submit to elderly saints because she is a young sister
In the church we do not talk about cultivating the self, putting the family in order, ruling the country, or living peacefully in the world
Those who are unsaved do not have the Lord, the Triune God, the divine dispensing, or the inward moving and anointing of the Spirit
A husband should only have the feeling that the Triune God is in him and that he has to speak according to the operation of the Triune God
If we are organizational, our activities will be organized, and we will be an organization, an organized entity
Before a brother is appointed as an elder, he may have had no sense of being anything but a saint who simply served the church
If a sister serves only because she has been given an 'assignment' by the elders, her service is organizational
Prior to being appointed to the eldership, a brother may be good, always exercising to be in spirit and organic
As soon as someone is assigned to be in charge or to take the lead, he undergoes a change in disposition and behavior
Prior to the assignment he had one disposition, but after the assignment he behaves organizationally based on his position
In Acts 2 Peter, standing with the eleven apostles, preached the gospel to the multitude, and about three thousand were saved
These three thousand new believers, in addition to the one hundred twenty disciples, became the church in Jerusalem
A large family may consist of multiple generations, including a grandfather, twelve sons, and the children of the twelve sons
When the church was established at Pentecost, three thousand souls were saved, and afterward another five thousand were saved
There was no need to appoint elders, because it was obvious to all the believers that Peter and the other eleven apostles were the elders
Concerning the appointment of elders, the Bible does not say that elders were appointed in the church in Jerusalem
They must have been considered as elders because they were a little more mature than the other believers in their locality
In order to avoid confusion, the apostles appointed elders in the churches, even elders who were not very mature or experienced
Even though the disciples were fearful of Paul, Barnabas contacted him, served with him in the work, and ministered together with him
After he participated in the work and gained experience, he was charged to appoint elders by the laying on of his hands
If an elder in a locality sinned, the witnesses could go to Timothy to present their accusation against the sinning elder
In chapter 14 Paul appointed elders in every church , but in chapter 20 he said that the Holy Spirit appointed the elders
Timothy was a young apostle, but he could appoint elders, reprove elders, and even remove someone from the eldership
Paul encouraged Timothy not to be timid, because God had not given Timothy a spirit of cowardice but of power, love, and sobermindedness
Paul also said that Timothy should know how to conduct himself in the house of God based on the Epistles Paul had written
Everything we do in the house of God must be organic; it must be according to the mysterious manifestation of God in the flesh
We truly hope that while leading the churches, the elders in all the localities would not forget that we are in the house of the living God
When we serve as elders, all our actions and decisions must be the manifestation of the living God-they must be organic
Timothy was probably saved through the elders' preaching of the gospel, and he was probably baptized by the elders
If the church and the work were based on the concept of organization, the elders would be his seniors, and he would be their junior
When an elder sinned, Timothy even had the position and qualification to receive an accusation against the elder from two or three witnesses
When this gift was manifested in Timothy, he appointed elders and laid hands on them according to his organic function
The young full-timers that are raised up in the church in Taichung do not need to be approved by the brothers in Taipei
If they cannot hire people who are trained, they send young people to seminaries for training and then assign work to them
Their submission should involve an organic operation that is much more than their human submission to parents or teachers
According to organizational thinking, the Corinthian believers could have told Paul not to speak until Christ, the Head, spoke
Since our knowledge concerning service may not be thorough, we may have concepts that we think are spiritual but are actually organizational
It seems that in 1 Corinthians 7 Paul had not prayed thoroughly, because it was he, not the Lord, who was speaking
The significance of Paul's word is that we should not be organizational, nor should we say, 'I am doing this because the Lord said so'
After this fellowship, we should be clear that our service is not a matter of keeping a position or obeying commands
If we are one spirit with the Lord, instead of keeping a position or merely obeying commands, we will exercise our organic function
We will know to whom we should listen; that is, we will listen to the organic function of the Body, and our living will be in the Body
We will not use Peter as an example, because he was appointed by the Lord Jesus while the Lord was in the flesh
Since we do not have the Lord's physical presence with us today, we cannot take Peter's experience as an example
After Paul met the Lord, he spontaneously and organically followed the Lord according to the divine life he had received from the Lord
When Paul went to Jerusalem, the disciples in Jerusalem were afraid to contact him because he had persecuted the church
In chapter 11 some of the disciples from Jerusalem, who were scattered abroad, went forth proclaiming the gospel, reaching as far as Antioch
Barnabas, according to his organic function in the Body, was sent from Jerusalem to visit the believers as far as Antioch
After visiting the believers, Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, found Paul, and brought him to Antioch, where he and Paul remained
Acts 13 shows that in the church in Antioch there were five prophets and teachers, the first being Barnabas and the last Paul
The church in Lystra was established by Paul in his first journey, and elders were appointed there within a short time
Paul mentioned Silvanus, Silas, and Timothy as his co-workers when he wrote his first Epistle to the Thessalonians
After Timothy was perfected, he was able to lay hands on others and even to respond properly to accusations against elders
Nee did not minister for six years from 1942 to 1948 and the church in Shanghai was restored only after the surrender of Japan in 1946
A year later we began the practice of the whole church preaching the gospel, and hundreds of people were baptized
The next year, 1949, the civil war within China became critical, and government agencies were moved from Shanghai to Taiwan
If we do not properly cultivate the trees, there will be problems: bugs will eat the leaves and branches, and birds will eat the fruit
The young brothers and sisters have a great future, but if their perfecting is flawed, they will not be safeguarded and protected
They may lead some students to salvation but they cannot speak the truth concerning the church because they do not have the proper standing
When these brothers were with us, they were 'married' to the church, but now they are 'divorced' from the church
By the Lord's mercy, some are still willing to read our books; thus, they still have a way to receive some supply
In the future you may be supplied with a great measure of grace by the Lord, and He may perfect you in order to use you to a great extent
You should walk quietly according to the Spirit and minister Christ in the meetings of the church in your locality
If a brother is raised up in a local church, other churches will learn about him, even if he has a quiet manner
Some formed their own groups, others established their own work, and still others gained honorary doctorate degrees
Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all
We should not be governed by our feelings being happy only when we are given sweet soymilk and being sad when we are given hot and sour soup
We should not expect that our service to the Lord will ensure that we have no problems or have a successful career
We cannot say that the church is no longer the church when a cold wind blows, or that the church is the church when a warm wind blows
Wherever we go, whether to Africa, South America, or Australia, the testimony among the churches is that we are all in the same move
If we fall into trouble on this way, we should humble ourselves and immediately make a turn, be adjusted, and stop struggling
Barnabas led Paul to the apostles in Jerusalem , but later, due to his sympathy for his cousin Mark, he separated from Paul
If a person has a thought to leave, he must understand that he is not separating from us but from the Lord's way
Although we cannot be completely void of a special feeling, we should always remember that our work is not for a specific locality
When you go abroad you will see that the result of the Lords work in Taiwan whether in Taipei Taoyuan or Taichung affects the United States
You should thank and praise the Lord if you are in Taoyuan today, and you should thank and praise the Lord if you are in Taichung tomorrow
Sometimes when we discuss the needs in one locality, the brothers and sisters from that locality speak for their locality
When we discuss the needs in another locality, the brothers and sisters from that locality speak for their locality
In order to advance the groups, we must use the serving ones in the homes, including the full-time and part-time serving ones
If we are strict and assign ten full-timers to each category of the work, not many will be assigned to advance the groups
They should study the situation of the meetings, the living situation of the brothers and sisters, and the spiritual level of the groups
Every group may have a different condition, but in principle it is possible to find the direction to lead the saints
The first time we meet with a group, we should give the saints the opportunity to speak freely with one another in a relaxed manner
We should keep in mind that having the group meeting is not for us to hold a large worship service in a small meeting
Of giving them more doctrine or spiritual material, we should give them more reality and an opportunity to speak
In particular, all those who are prepared to serve full time must assist the elders to promote the small groups
We must remember not to turn the atmosphere in the group meeting into an atmosphere of a small worship service
The work of the small groups is mainly to restore the dormant saints and to promote the gospel preaching in the homes
When the groups function, we can spontaneously bring in dormant saints, and it will be easy for them to be restored
Concerning the practice of the group meetings, we are short of experience and personnel, even though we have four hundred groups
If the fire in a group has not been kindled, the serving ones should bear responsibility to help kindle the fire
The members of a group should include brothers, sisters, elderly saints, and younger ones, without any distinction
It is possible for an elderly sister to lead young sisters and for a young sister to lead a group of elderly sisters
The elders should not be involved in grouping the saints and the serving ones together in any way other than geography
Initially, many people are needed to push it, but once the old car starts moving, those who were pushing can take care of other matters
In the same principle, once the groups begin to function, we will not need four hundred serving ones to push them
Suppose a co-worker goes to lead and nurture a small group in which there are many sisters but only a few brothers
Our meetings can be compared to eating, and just as we need to eat three meals a day, we need to meet frequently
We can also ask the saints about their interests, but we should be careful not to hold general conversations about things like the weather
Neither should the conversation center on one person; rather, everyone should be brought into the conversation
Our purpose is to know the spiritual condition of the saints and then to fan into flame the gift that is within them
It is more important for us to fan the gift within you into flame so that you are stirred up to serve the Lord'
We often have meetings with no result, because we continually dribble the ball, but no one takes a shot at the basket
As soon as every dormant saint in the neighborhood has been accounted for, we should wisely stop the conversation
Surely some will have such a burden, and their response will prove that their spirit has been fanned into flame
We should simply let the saints come together in order to arrive at the goal of everyone in the group rising up to serve
The young ones need to be trained so that they are nothing at home but full of boldness when they meet with the saints
Since we have a desire to serve the Lord, the young serving ones, especially the sisters, must learn to be bold
Instead of asking the saints directly, we must understand their situation by contacting them and speaking with them
Answer: In the Lord's recovery we must learn to always begin from a foundation and to reject centralized authority
Every group is a unit in itself, but those who lead the groups should always have fellowship with one another and keep the oneness in spirit
If the sisters feel that they have time to come together for prayer apart from their small group, it would be very good
It is all right for some saints to have morning revival together and then come together again in the afternoon to pray
Even if the groups meet once a week, after three to five weeks, we will cause four to five thousand saints in the church to be burning
They have been meeting regularly and have listened to many messages, so they have reached a certain level of spirituality
Some of the groups are strong, and it seems that they do not need others to lead them, but they may still keep some old practices
