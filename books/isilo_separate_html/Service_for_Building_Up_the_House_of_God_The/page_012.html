AND MORAL CHARACTER</h2>
<p>Let us consider what it means to supply life. Christianity speaks of being good, which involves moral character, good deeds, and good behavior. Christianity does not speak of the divine life referred to in the Word of God. The Bible says, &ldquo;Death operates in us, but life in you&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:12). This means that when the death of Christ operates in us, life operates in others. This life is not moral character or behavior; rather, it is the life of God. This is a great distinction.</p>
<p>Those who serve God should indeed have good moral character, have good behavior, and do good deeds; otherwise, they will hinder others from receiving the divine life. In order not to hinder others from receiving the supply of life, we must do good deeds and have good moral character. However, good deeds and good moral character do not necessarily mean that the life of God is expressed through us. We may be irreproachable and commendable in our service yet express merely good character, perfection, and human virtues, but these are not the life of God.</p>
<p>Few among God&rsquo;s children can distinguish between life and good behavior. If a brother supplies others with copper, they will receive copper. If he supplies them with gold, they will receive gold. If we supply the saints with life, God&rsquo;s children will have a taste for life. People cannot have a taste for something that they have not seen. Christians do not have a taste for life because the element of life is lacking in Christianity. What is expressed in Christianity is good moral character and good behavior. We need to understand that the moral character and good behavior spoken of in the Bible are none other than the life of God being expressed through man. Our service depends on our knowing what is life and what is the outflow of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD BEING TO FLOW OUT LIFE</h2>
<p>Let us consider how the life of God flows out from us. The Spirit is life, and the Spirit is God Himself (John 6:63; 4:24). Through incarnation God became a man by the name Jesus Christ and lived a perfect human life, was crucified, and resurrected. In resurrection Christ became the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is Christ, and Christ is God. Since the Spirit is God, the life of God is in the Spirit. In order to supply others with the life of God, we must be in spirit and we must fellowship with God. When we cease fellowshipping with God, we are cut off from the divine life. Fellowshipping with God must become our experience and not merely doctrinal knowledge.</p>
<p>God and the life of God are inseparable. Hence, a person who receives the life of God also receives God. We cannot say that we want the life of God but that we do not want God, because a person cannot be separated from his life. When we received God, we gained His life, but when we reject God, we cannot gain His life. Likewise, we should not expect the life of God to be expressed through us when we do not fellowship with God and do not live one with Him. Although we cannot be separated from God because we have His life, in our experience we are cut off from the flow of the divine life when we do not maintain our fellowship with God.</p>
<p>If we want the life of God to flow out of us so that we can supply others with this life, we must have unhindered fellowship with God, contacting Him not only every day but every moment. Only when we are contacting God can the life of God flow out of us.</p>
<p>We must have the proper experience of fellowship. We need to daily set aside definite times to fellowship with God. No one can fellowship with God without spending time in prayer. In particular, the saints who serve must daily allocate enough quality time to fellowship with God in prayer. The focus of such prayer is not for God to give us things or to do things for us but for us to commune with God in spirit, that is, for us to breathe in God and enjoy Him. The more time we spend fellowshipping with God, breathing Him in, and enjoying Him, the better.</p>
<p>It is best to have a time of fellowship in the morning. It is difficult for us to let the divine life flow out without having sufficient fellowship with the Lord in the morning. A person who can do such will be quite deep in the Lord. We must spend enough time in the morning to enjoy the Lord and to fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>Besides having set times to fellowship with the Lord, we should also keep ourselves in unceasing fellowship with Him. We should not let anything come between us and the Lord. Anything that comes between us and the Lord becomes a barrier. Such an item can be a thought, an intention, an emotion, a person, or a thing. Once we perceive that something has come between us and God, we must immediately reject, judge, and condemn it. Such condemning and judging will not only maintain our fellowship with God but also deepen it. Only those who have such moment-by-moment fellowship with God can supply others with the divine life. Then no matter what we do, whom we contact, or what we say, life will always flow out of us. Furthermore, those who contact us will sense God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
