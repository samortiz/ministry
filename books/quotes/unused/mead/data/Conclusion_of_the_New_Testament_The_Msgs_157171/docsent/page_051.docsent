   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Putting on the Whole Armor of God to Stand against the Stratagems of the Devil</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Ephesians 6:11 Paul says, "Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the stratagems of the Devil."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To fight the spiritual warfare we need not only the power of the Lord but also the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our weapons do not avail, but God's armor, even the whole armor of God, does.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The whole armor of God is for the entire Body, not for any individual member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers together make up this unique warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only the corporate warrior can wear the whole armor of God; no individual believer can wear it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, we must fight the spiritual warfare not individually but in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The charge to put on the whole armor of God is an imperative, a command.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God has provided the armor for us, but He does not put it on for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, we ourselves must put on the armor God has provided.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this, we need to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although God can empower us, we still must exercise our will to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same principle, we must cooperate with God's command to put on the armor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to put on the armor of God so that we "may be able to stand."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Ephesians 6 the word "stand" is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To sit with Christ 2:6 is to participate in all His accomplishments; to walk in His Body 4:1, 17; 5:2, 8, 15 is to fulfill God's eternal purpose; and to stand in His power is to fight against God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By putting on the whole armor of God we are able to stand against "the stratagems of the Devil."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These stratagems are the Devil's evil plans.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not only does the Devil have an evil will, but he also has subtle stratagems to work out his will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even now Satan is busily working and plotting to carry out his evil, subtle stratagems.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ephesians 6:13 says, "Take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 11 we are told to put on the armor of God, and in verse 13 we are charged to take it up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The armor of God has been prepared and provided by God for us, but we need to take it up and put it on; that is, we need to use and apply God's provision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some items of the armor, such as the sword and the shield, we take up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But other items, such as the breastplate, the helmet, and the shoes, we put on.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether we put on the whole armor of God or take it up, we must exercise our will in a strong way to apply God's provision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In verses 11 and 13 Paul specifically speaks of "the whole armor of God," not just a part or some parts of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In order to wage the spiritual warfare, we need the whole armor.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This requires the Body of Christ, not only individual believers, to take it up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This armor is not for the believers as individuals; it is for the church corporately as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only the corporate warrior, the Body, can wear the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By taking up the whole armor of God we shall be able "to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To withstand is to stand against.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In fighting, the most important thing is to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this fighting we need to stand to the end. Having done all, we still must stand.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to Ephesians 6, Christ is the armor that we put on for our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In verses 14 through 17 there are six aspects of Christ as the armor: the girdle of truth, or reality, the breastplate of righteousness, the firm foundation of the gospel of peace the shoes , the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Of these six aspects of Christ as our armor, only the sword is for offensive warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the other items are for defense. a Girding Their Loins with Truth</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 6:14 says, "Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For us to gird our loins is to strengthen our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For the purpose of standing, our whole being needs to be strengthened with truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Truth in 6:14 refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and expressed by us as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such truth, such reality, is the girdle which strengthens our being for spiritual warfare.</S>
