   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DISTRACTED FROM THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many Christians have received teachings that distract them from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some have been taught in this way: Now that you are a child of God, you must behave yourself and glorify God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Devil, however, is busy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He never sleeps.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He will tempt you, seduce you, and cause you to do many evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Formerly, you were under his control.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now that you have become a child of God, he will not let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, he will do many things to trouble you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, you need to fast, pray, and exert all your effort to live a proper Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have learned from experience that this kind of teaching distracts us from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more we make up our mind to behave ourselves for the glory of God, the more we become like the wretched man described in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Defeated Christians who seek the advice of preachers may be exhorted to pray more or to read the Bible more.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But even these activities, when they are simply our own doings, can cause us to switch off the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The divine electricity has been installed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once it has been switched on, we should not turn the switch off.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, by their innocent doings, many Christians have turned off the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As a result, some begin to doubt if they have truly been saved, or if they really have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This may cause them to go from one Christian group to another seeking help.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the situation among many of today s Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of situation is very different from the good news of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The gospel is this: God selected us, predestinated us, and marked us out in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then one day the Son of God came to accomplish everything for our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection and has become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you heard the proclamation of the good news and acknowledged it, this life-giving Spirit entered into you and began to dwell in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now just stay in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do not do anything that will take you away from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the contrary, just declare that you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Proclaim this wonderful fact: The gospel was a proclamation, and I have acknowledged it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now the Spirit of God dwells in me, and I am in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we declare this in faith, nothing will be able to defeat us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the contrary, everything will be under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the glad tidings, the gospel of Christ, and the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Those who have been Christians for a long time may still have memories of defeats and failures.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, when they hear about proclaiming the fact that since the Spirit of God dwells in us, we are in the spirit, they may ask questions about different things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may wonder about this and that.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to forget all these matters and proclaim that we are in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not say, How about my problems at work or at home?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, say, I am in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The small word in has very great significance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to 8:1, there is now no condemnation to those who are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to 8:9, since the Spirit of God dwells in us, we are not in the flesh, but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no need for us to try to do so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should simply acknowledge the facts and proclaim them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When I was a young Christian seeking the Lord, I bought many books on subjects such as how to pray, how to be holy, and how to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I was always interested in how to : how to be spiritual, how to be victorious, how to please God, how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, eventually I learned that these books could not help me.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Instead of reading books on how to do this or that, it is better to read and pray-read Romans 8 verse by verse.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This will fill you with enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You need to give special attention to verse 9, concentrating on the words in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Again and again, we need to pray over and declare the fact that we are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>THE MINGLED SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is difficult to determine if the word spirit in the phrase in the spirit should be capitalized.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The reason for the difficulty is that this word refers to the mingled spirit, to the divine Spirit mingled with our regenerated human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Verse 16 refers to these two spirits: The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This verse does not say that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It says the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To say that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit is deeper than saying that the Spirit and our spirit witness, for it indicates that the two spirits are one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To say that the Spirit and our spirit witness means that these spirits remain two.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But to say that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit indicates that the two spirits have been mingled and have become one.</S>
