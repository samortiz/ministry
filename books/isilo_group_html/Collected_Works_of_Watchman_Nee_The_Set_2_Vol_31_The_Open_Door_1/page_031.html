I will be able to distribute the latter to the brothers in a few days. When the book arrived, I read it in one sitting. The content is very fresh. My spiritual eyes and ears were renewed, and I learned more about the standard of the work. I was very happy. May all the glory go to the Creator. The gospel work continues as usual, and the number who believe and receive increases daily. We had a Bible-study conference a month ago and many attended. We feel that our meeting place is too small. Some brothers have suggested that we expand our gospel preaching place to the area in front of the big temple. We are already moving this way, but we are still praying and do not know whether it will be accomplished. The Lord willing, I will go to Kutien around the Chinese New Year to have some meetings because they have recently rented a larger hall there. We can probably use it to gather all the believers in the whole county there for a conference. Please do not forget to pray for this. The situation in Foochow is still quiet. All the brothers are living and working in peace. May the Lord be merciful that my life would become a greater testimony to Him. Please pray much for me. I also hope to receive your letters often. Peace to you.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Jeng-fan<br />January 6<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother James Chen, Swatow</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved brother in the Lord, Mr. X:</p><p>I think you published my last letter describing something of the condition here. I would like to give you the latest report to dispel your concerns. On December 18 I received the Lord's marvelous leading through a brother's introduction to do some work in Jieh-Yang. Two brothers and one sister went with me. First we preached the gospel for six days in the West Gate Chapel. Although there were not many people, the spirit of the meeting was very good. We had the Lord's presence, and He worked with us. Later we were invited to the North Gate Chapel to preach the gospel, and we continued speaking for eight days. We must thank and praise the Lord for the door He has opened and the work He has started! Regrettably, our work did not give the Holy Spirit the complete freedom to express His power. For this we feel remorseful. May the Lord have mercy on me and perfect me more each day so that I would become a useful vessel to Him, amen. In my work I have experienced something from the Lord. I was very weak physically and spent most of the time lying down, except when I was preaching. I did not even walk much because I felt as if I would fall down whenever I began to walk. According to my physical condition, it did not seem that I could preach the gospel for two weeks. I thought that since the Lord had opened the door, it was an opportunity that could not be missed. Furthermore, I believed that the Lord's grace was sufficient for me. The Lord's grace is perfected in weakness, so I continued by faith. Thank the Lord, His word is faithful. Every time I stood up to speak, His power covered me. Once I stepped down, I was a sick man again. During this period of time I experienced the words: "Death operates in us, but life in you" (2 Cor. 4:12).</p><p>Now there are many places that have invited us to work. We are not lacking in opportunity, but we do not have the spiritual content and power to grasp the opportunity. If the political condition does not change, I really want to go to many more places. I also hope that the Lord would raise up His testimony in the region of Chaochow and Mei County. Brother Chen Wen-kwang has an illness of the throat; he is taking a vacation and has returned home to rest. According to man's view, it seems as if this region temporarily has lost a brother who can bear the responsibility. However, the Lord always has His good will. Elijah thought that he was the only one left among the prophets of Israel, but God still had seven thousand on His side, one of whom was Elisha. Therefore, we do not need to fear when Elijah is raptured; our only fear is that Elisha would not be raised up. The brothers and sisters here are all in peace. Everything is normal, so be comforted. Peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />James Chen<br />January 7<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
