<h1 class="title">Christ in His Redeeming Death<br />
and Church-producing Resurrection</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 22; Matt. 27:45-46; Heb. 2:10-12</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The subject of Psalm 22 is the Christ who has passed through His redeeming death and entered into His church-producing resurrection.</li>
<li>Psalm 22:1-21 gives a detailed picture of Christ in His suffering of death (cf. Isa. 53), as typified by David in his suffering:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The question in Psalm 22:1 was spoken by David in his suffering, but it became a prophecy concerning Christ in His suffering of His redeeming death.</li>
	<li>Verses 6 through 8 display Christ&rsquo;s suffering unto death through men&rsquo;s reproach, despising, deriding, sneering, head-shaking, and mocking.</li>
	<li>Verses 9 through 11 show that while people were mocking Him and deriding Him, Christ trusted in God for deliverance, that is, for resurrection; He intended definitely to die and expected to be delivered from death, that is, to be resurrected from the dead&mdash;Luke 18:31-33; Heb. 5:7.</li>
	<li>Psalm 22:12-18 depicts in vivid detail how Christ passed through His suffering of crucifixion&mdash;Mark 15:16-37.</li>
	<li>God judged Christ and put Him into death for our redemption&mdash;Psa. 22:15:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>On the one hand, man crucified the Lord Jesus; on the other hand, God killed Him:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>In the first three hours that Christ was on the cross, He was persecuted by men for doing God&rsquo;s will.</li>
			<li>In the last three hours, Christ was our Substitute, He became sin on our behalf, and He died a vicarious death to redeem us from our sins and from God&rsquo;s judgment&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Pet. 3:18; 1 Cor. 15:3.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>All the sin of the world was laid on Christ as the Lamb of God; God judged Him and put Him into death for our redemption&mdash;Isa. 53:6b, 10a; 1 Pet. 2:24a; John 1:29.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>On the cross Christ was forsaken by God&mdash;Psa. 22:1; Matt. 27:45-46:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>While Christ was on the earth, God the Father was with Him all the time, but at a certain point in His crucifixion, God forsook Him&mdash;John 8:29; Matt. 27:45-46.</li>
		<li>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross under God&rsquo;s judgment, He had God within Him essentially as His divine being; nevertheless, He was forsaken by the righteous and judging God economically&mdash;1:20; 3:16-17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The Lord Jesus had been born of the Spirit; thus, the Spirit was one of the two essences of His being&mdash;1:20; Luke 1:35.</li>
			<li>Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon the Lord Jesus, He already had the Spirit of God within Him&mdash;Matt. 3:16.</li>
			<li>On the cross Christ, the God-man, presented Himself to God as the all-inclusive sacrifice through the eternal Spirit&mdash;Heb. 9:14.</li>
			<li>After God had counted Christ as a sinner to be our Substitute and had accepted His offering, God, as the Holy Spirit who had come upon Him, forsook Him&mdash;Matt. 27:46.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Although God as the Spirit left the Lord Jesus economically, Christ nevertheless died as the Son of God, a God-man; hence, in His death there is a divine and eternal element&mdash;Acts 20:28; 1 John 1:7; Heb. 9:12.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>After passing through His redeeming death, Christ entered into His church-producing resurrection&mdash;Psa. 22:22-31:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Verses 22 through 31 refer to Christ in His resurrection, as typified by Solomon in his kingly reign.</li>
	<li><em>I</em> in verse 22a is the resurrected Christ who declares the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers&mdash;Heb. 2:12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>It was in His resurrection that Christ called His disciples His brothers, for in God&rsquo;s eternal view His disciples were regenerated and became God&rsquo;s sons in Christ&rsquo;s resurrection&mdash;John 20:17; Matt. 28:10; 1 Pet. 1:3.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ Himself was begotten to be God&rsquo;s firstborn Son (Psa. 2:7; Acts 13:33) and became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b), and all God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people were regenerated to be the many sons of God, the many brothers of Christ (Heb. 2:10-12; Rom. 8:29).</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Psalm 22:22b the assembly signifies the church, indicating that the Lord&rsquo;s brothers constitute the church; thus, His resurrection is the church-producing resurrection&mdash;Heb. 2:10-12:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The church is a living composition of the many sons of God, who are the many brothers of Christ, brought forth in His resurrection&mdash;vv. 10-12.</li>
		<li>As the many brothers of Christ, we are the same as the firstborn Son; He is divine and human, and we are human and divine, and thus the church is both human and divine&mdash;an organism with two lives and two natures combined and mingled together&mdash;v. 11; 1:6; Rom. 8:29; cf. Lev. 2.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In Psalm 22:22 <em>You</em> and <em>Your</em> refer to the Father:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In resurrection Christ declared the Father&rsquo;s name to His brothers and praised the Father in the church&mdash;Heb. 2:12.</li>
		<li>The praise in Psalm 22:22 is the firstborn Son&rsquo;s praising of the Father within the Father&rsquo;s many sons in the church meetings&mdash;Heb. 2:10, 12:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>It is not that the Son praises the Father apart from us and alone; rather, He praises within us and with us through our praising.</li>
			<li>When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising&mdash;v. 12b; cf. Matt. 26:30.</li>
			</ol></li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>The church ushers in Christ&rsquo;s kingdom for Christ to rule over the nations; the church, produced by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, is the reality of the kingdom and a precursor to the manifestation of the kingdom in the millennium&mdash;Psa. 22:27-28; Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17.</li>
	<li>Jehovah as Christ will rule over the nations in the millennial kingdom&mdash;Psa. 22:28; 2:8-9; Rev. 19:15; 20:4, 6.</li>
	<li>The believers are the seed of Christ, and their declaring the Lord&rsquo;s righteousness (justification, salvation) to a coming generation refers to the preaching of the gospel&mdash;Psa. 22:30-31.</li>
