<h2 class="head1">SATAN INJECTING HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2>
<p>God has an enemy in this universe. This enemy, Satan, wants to counterfeit whatever God desires to do. God wants to enter into man, so His enemy wants to inject himself into man. God wants to be united with man, so His enemy wants to enter into a union with man. Furthermore, before God accomplished His desire, Satan acted first in order to beat God.</p>
<p>For example, the thought of building a city is of God. In Genesis 2 there was only a garden; there was no city. The garden of Eden did not have a wall or a border (vv. 8-14). At the end of the Bible, however, a city appears, and this city has a border (Rev. 21:10-17). Therefore, the desire to build a city began with God. However, who built the first city? In Genesis 4 Cain built the city of Enoch (v. 17). This was done by Satan to frustrate God. Satan was quick to build a city among men because he knew that God wanted to build a city among His people. This is proof that when God desires to do something, Satan will be quick with a counterfeit to frustrate God.</p>
<p>God wants to enter into man, so Satan also wants to enter into man. God wants to be mingled with man, so Satan also wants to inject himself into man. God is aware of Satan&rsquo;s desire, so He placed the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the garden of Eden to serve as a reminder and a warning. This tree signifies Satan, who wants to enter into man and become the evil element within man. The issue of man&rsquo;s eating of this tree is that man received death (2:16-17).</p>
<p>In chapter 3 Satan, embodied in the serpent, came in (vv. 1-15). The serpent in chapter 3 and the tree of knowledge in chapter 2 are inseparable; the two are one. When man ate of the tree of knowledge, he received the serpent. It is no wonder that in the New Testament both John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus rebuked the Pharisees, who were followers of Satan, saying that they were the &ldquo;offspring of vipers&rdquo; and a &ldquo;brood of vipers&rdquo; (Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33). Man had received Satan into him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE<br />
BEING THE TWO LINES IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The tree of life signifies God being mingled with man, and the tree of knowledge signifies Satan injecting himself into man. These two trees are two main lines that run through the entire Bible. They are also the controlling thought of the Bible. If we read the Bible without seeing these two lines, we are inexperienced Bible readers.</p>
<p>Before reading a book on military science, we must first grasp the concept of that subject. Then, whether the book touches economics, politics, history, or geography, we will not deviate from the central thought. We should apply this principle when we read the Bible. It is very difficult to understand the controlling thought of the Bible. Therefore, in order for the saints to understand this thought, I have done my best to present the line that connects the Bible. This line is in the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. If we read these four chapters and compare the beginning and the end of the Bible, we will understand the controlling line in these chapters. Then it will be relatively easy for us to read the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LINES OF THE TREE OF LIFE AND<br />
OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The tree of life and the tree of knowledge are the controlling lines in the Bible. We may say that the Bible consists of the two lines of God being mingled with man and of Satan injecting himself into man. We will now consider the Old Testament based on these two lines. The Old Testament can be divided into three sections. The first section is the books of history, the second section is the books of poetry, and the third section is the books of the prophets.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Books of History</h2>
<p>In the books of history the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s style of writing shows how people developed according to the evil aspect of the tree of knowledge. It also shows how God called a group of people out of this evil development to contact and enjoy the tree of life. However, the majority of mankind, including the Israelites, developed according to the evil aspect of the tree of knowledge.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Books of Poetry</h2>
<p>The books of poetry present a group of saints who remained in the development of the good aspect of the tree of knowledge, even though God had separated them from worldly people. Because they remained in the tree of knowledge, they were smitten by God. God smote them so that they would be freed from the good aspect of the tree of knowledge and would live purely in God who is life. Therefore, in Song of Songs, the last of the books of poetry, man is God&rsquo;s beloved, and God is man&rsquo;s Beloved and Husband (1:9, 14; 2:2, 10). Apart from God, man cannot have joy. Everything related to man depends on God, and man needs to enter into complete union with God. In Song of Songs man is freed from both the evil and the good aspects of the tree of knowledge in order to fully enjoy the tree of life, God Himself. God is the tree of life to be man&rsquo;s Beloved, and man is God&rsquo;s beloved. In this realm there is neither evil nor good; there is only God as the Beloved. The Beloved is everything to His loved one. She does not know what it means to do good, nor does she care for doing evil. She simply loves and pursues the Beloved.</p>
