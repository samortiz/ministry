   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-EIGHT FORGIVING OUR BROTHER Scripture Reading: Matt 18:21-35</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we will consider the matter of offense and forgiveness among Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After we have believed in the Lord, we have to settle one question: What should we do when a brother has sinned against us?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 18:21-22 the Lord Jesus told us that if a brother sins against us, we must not only forgive him once but seventy times seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>GOD'S FORGIVENESS BEING UNLIMITED</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Matthew 18:21 says, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Up to seven times?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is to our advantage that Peter asked this question.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although his spirit was wrong, his question helps us to clarify the matter of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord seemed to be saying, "You have asked how many times you should forgive a brother who has sinned against you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should have asked instead how many times you should be forgiven when you sin against God."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If God said, "I will forgive you seven times," this would be a very low standard indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we sin against God, His feeling is hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet our feeling is not that strong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When others sin against us, our feelings are hurt, and it is hard for us to let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Yet God is love, and love does not seek for its own gain.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although God is hurt, His forgiving grace is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter's question shows that he was seeking for his own gain.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He suffered because he was hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The price he had to pay for forgiving others was himself, that is, the suffering of being hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason he asked the Lord, "How often shall others sin against me and I forgive them?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Up to seven times?"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter said this to show that he was quite magnanimous.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Two or three times would have been enough to him, but he made it seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There was, however, something wrong with his basic premise.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He thought God's grace is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fact is that God's grace has no bounds; it is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It follows that the forgiveness which God's children practice should also be unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Luke 17:3-4 the Lord said to the disciples, "If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns again to you seven times, saying, I repent, you shall forgive him."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the Lord spoke, the disciples followed with a prayer asking the Lord to increase their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They found it hard to believe in the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They felt that it was hard to believe that a brother could sin against another seven times a day and then repent seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They thought that it was inconceivable that such a one could be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, they said, "Increase our faith."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Under such circumstances, God's children should still forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether or not those who ask for forgiveness are genuine is not our concern.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As long as a man asks for forgiveness, we should forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Matthew says that we should forgive our brothers not only seven times, but seventy times seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Luke says that if a brother sins against us seven times a day and then repents, we have to forgive him irrespective of his motive.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whether or not his repentance is genuine, we have to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As long as he comes to us, we have to forgive him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Matthew, Peter's conversation omitted the words "in a day" and somewhat changed the meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Luke speaks of the same incident related to the same person, but he speaks of a man sinning seven times in a day, repenting, and then being forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter changed the same story around.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He asked the Lord if it was enough to forgive seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By framing the question this way, he made love, grace, and forgiveness all qualities that are limited in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Luke 17 the Lord indicates that love, grace, and forgiveness are all unlimited in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Peter's question in Matthew 18 made love, grace, and forgiveness all limited in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus realized that Peter had changed the wording of the question.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His answer about forgiving one's brother revealed that this was not a matter of sufficiency.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was not a question of seven times, but of seventy times seven.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God's love, grace, and forgiveness are unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Humanly speaking, thirty-five times of forgiveness would stretch a person to his limit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Seventy times seven is something beyond the reach of human power.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is too heavy a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows us that the power to forgive is something beyond man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>At the same time, those who receive forgiveness are not receiving it from man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They receive forgiveness from another power.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Matthew 18:22 says, "Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord indictes that forgiveness has nothing to do with the number of times one forgives.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If anyone wants a number, let it be seventy times seven.</S>
