   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR THE HOLY LAND AND THE HOLY CITY Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>45:1-8; 47:13-20; 48:1-35; Rev 21:12, 13 THE LAND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the end of the book of Ezekiel there are two things: the holy land and the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to see something more concerning the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apart from the land, there could be no temple.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although we may appreciate the temple very much, we have to realize that the temple is in the land, and without the land there could not be a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The temple depends upon the land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The temple typifies the church, and the land typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Without the experience of Christ, there is no possibility for us to have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church is the issue of the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A History of the Land</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the land, typifying Christ, is so crucial, we need to look at it once more.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The land is first mentioned in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>On the third day of the Lord's recovery of His creation, the land was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The land emerged from the waters of death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Until that time all the land was under the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But on the third day the Lord caused the land to rise up out of the death waters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The land in Genesis 1 typifies Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ was resurrected from the dead on the third day as the all-inclusive land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every kind of life, whether vegetable, animal, or human, came out of that land.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from that land, no life can exist.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>All of the living things came into being out of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the land signifies Christ, it means that all the living things come out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is the good land which God prepared for man.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, man fell and became degraded, causing God to judge the earth again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the time of Noah, the land was flooded and once more was covered by the death waters Gen 7:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This means that the human race lost the land.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once again, however, the Lord brought the land out of the death waters, and the family of Noah was given the right to enjoy the land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the descendants of Noah fell and gathered at Babel to build a tower of rebellion against God Gen 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>From Babel God scattered the people and called out Abraham from that fallen place and brought him into Canaan, the good land Gen 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At that time God promised Abraham that the land of Canaan would belong to him and to his children.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the descendants of Abraham also fell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Human history is a record of man's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They fell from the good land into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The whole house of Jacob went down into Egypt and again they lost the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But four hundred years later, by God's deliverance, they experienced the Passover and, passing through the Red Sea, they left Egypt Exo 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After forty years of wandering in the wilderness, they passed through the Jordan into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There they fought against all the inhabitants and recovered their lost land.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Upon that recovered land, they built the temple, and God's glory descended and filled the temple 2 Chron 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Later, though, due to their falling away and their degradation, they were carried away from the land again.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They lost the land once more.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the midst of the captivity, Ezekiel was brought back to the land by the Spirit 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ezekiel went back by the Spirit to see the land.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times in Ezekiel, the Lord promised that He would bring His people back to their land Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>11, 33, 34, 36 and 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He promised to bring them back even to the top of the mountains of Israel 34:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This indicated a real recovery of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before the building can be recovered, the land must be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The recovery of the land signifies the recovery of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although Christ Himself can never be lost, Christ in our experience can be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At the time we were saved we received Christ, but not long afterward we fell away and lost Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The recovery of the land is the recovery of the experiences of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The land was recovered!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then the house was built on the land.</S>
