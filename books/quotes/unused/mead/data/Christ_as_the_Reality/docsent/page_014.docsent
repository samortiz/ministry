   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE HUMANITY OF JESUS THE MEAL OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 2:1-16 Note: change the word "meat" to "meal" throughout this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have pointed out that there are five kinds of offerings because we are in five situations before God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our first situation is that we are not for God; therefore, we need the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The burnt offering is Christ who is absolutely for God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we come to our second situation before God, that is, we are not perfect and fine.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fine means there is nothing rough or coarse; it also means there is nothing short and nothing too much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Sometimes we are just a little too much in certain things, and sometimes we lack in the things that are necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>So because we are not perfect and fine, we need the second kind of offering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the meal offering made of fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BURNT OFFERING AND THE MEAL OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why does the meal offering follow the burnt offering?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To see this we must see the differences between the burnt offering and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The burnt offering is something of the animal life: a bullock, a sheep, or a turtledove.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the meal offering is absolutely of another kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not of the animal kingdom, but of the vegetable kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fine flour is made from wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus is pictured as being of two kinds of lives: the animal life and the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The animal life is for redeeming, for there is the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the shedding of blood, there is no redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The vegetable life is for generating or producing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Gospel of John, the Lord is portrayed as having both the animal and the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!"</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 12:24 says, "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Lamb, He is of the animal kingdom, and as the grain of wheat, He is of the vegetable kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, by these two chapters in John, we realize that the Lamb, the animal life, is for redeeming, and the grain of wheat, the vegetable life, is for producing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One grain produces many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus is the Lamb, and He is also the grain of wheat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He is of the animal life and also of the vegetable life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is the redeeming One, and He is also the producing One.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By this we see that the burnt offering is mainly for redeeming.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Leviticus 1, the word "blood" is mentioned at least three times.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The burnt offering is for our redemption by the sprinkled blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are told clearly that the burnt offering is not for our food or satisfaction, but wholly for God's satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The meal offering, however, is mainly for our nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to be redeemed, and we also need to be nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The burnt offering satisfies God, but the meal offering not only satisfies God, but also makes us alive.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It causes us to live in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another thing which we must see is that all the sufferings in the burnt offering are for redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sufferings in the meal offering, however, are not for redeeming, but are the personal sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, in the burnt offering, the blood is prominent, but with the meal offering, the prominent things are the oil and the frankincense.</S>
