<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH<br>BECOMING ISRAEL'S LIGHT AND<br>GLORY FOREVER</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Glory of Jehovah Rising upon Israel</H2><P>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is the glory of Jehovah arising upon Israel (60:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Nations All Gathering Together to Israel</H2><P>The nations will all gather together to Israel with Israel's captives and with the nations' wealth (vv. 4-9). This refers to the time of Israel's restoration. When Christ comes back as the saving Redeemer, Israel as God's elect and as the center of the world's population will be restored in every respect. At that time, all the Gentile nations will be for Israel. Not only Israel's captives but also the wealth of the nations will be gathered to Israel.</P><P>Verse 8 says, "Who are these who fly like a cloud, / And like the doves to their dovecote?" This may be a prophecy that many of Israel's captives will return to Israel by airplane.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Nations Building<br>Israel's Walls and Ministering<br>to Her with Their Wealth and Glory</H2><P>The nations will build Israel's walls and will minister to her with their wealth and glory (vv. 10-14). The word glory in verse 13 refers to the products of the nations (Gen. 31:1, 16; Esth. 1:4). The nations will minister to Israel with their wealth and with their best products.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Israel to Be Made<br>an Eternal Excellency and a Joy</H2><P>Verses 15 through 18 reveal that in her restoration Israel will be made an eternal excellency and a joy for generations. Israel will be the excellency of the human race.</P>
