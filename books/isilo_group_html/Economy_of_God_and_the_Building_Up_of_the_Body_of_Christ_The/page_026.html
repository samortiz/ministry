Without these few verses, we would not know how to build up the Body of Christ. First, we must say that to build up the Body of Christ is not to build up a congregation. A congregation is an organization, but the Body of Christ is an organism. An organism is altogether a matter of life, whereas an organization has no life. For example, a table is framed together from pieces of wood. It is just an organization; it does not have any life within. A robot may do all kinds of things, but it is still an organization; it has no life. On the contrary, I stand here not as an organization but as an organism. My whole being is a story of life; every part of me is of life. Some think that since the church is a congregation, it must be an organization. However, immediately after Paul mentioned the church in Ephesians 1:22, he said in verse 23 that the church is the Body of Christ. Some Bible expositors have considered the Body of Christ to be a metaphor. But the Bible says explicitly that the church is the Body of Christ. It is not a metaphor, but a fact. Christ is the Head, and the church is His Body. Since the Head is an organism, the Body must also be an organism. Hence, organization has no place in the church.<p>Some may ask, &#8220;Since there are elders in the church, is this not an organization?&#8221; Apparently it seems to be an organization, but actually the eldership is not an organization. The elders are such not by their position but by their degree of life in the Lord. This is why 1 Peter 5 charges the elders to shepherd the flock of God among them, not lording it over them but becoming examples to the flock (vv. 1-3). This shows us that in the church the elders are there not by organization but by their life; they are to be the examples to the flock. A sheep is a very communal animal; the whole flock follows the leading of one head sheep. The elders are the head sheep. On the one hand, the elders are like the shepherds. But actually, the Lord did not ask them to be the shepherds. Rather, He charged them to be the head sheep, taking the lead in everything. Hence, this is not organizational but organic. It is not based on arrangement but on life. For example, while I am speaking here, not only does my mouth move, my whole being-hands, head, eyes, feet, and the whole body-move as well. When one part of the body is sick, the whole body cares for it. This is not by arrangement nor is it artificial. Rather, it is something organic.<p>Some have said that the local church is an autonomous congregation: each should be governed by itself, and all the localities are separate. Seemingly this saying is correct. Actually it is wrong because each church is not an individual body. The Body is the sum total of all the churches added together. In a body one cannot carve out any autonomy. If the shoulder, the arm, the hands, the head, the chest, and the legs all separate themselves into autonomies, the body is completely dismembered. Even though superficially we may distinguish the different parts of the body, the blood circulation within them cannot be separated. Two weeks ago we were visiting an elderly sister just as a middle-aged sister came to treat this one&#8217;s leg pain with acupuncture. It was so wonderful that by putting the needle in the sister&#8217;s finger, the pain in her leg was gone. This tells us that the human body is organic and is an integrated whole. Also, 1 Corinthians 12:26 says that when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Hence, a body cannot be divided, and none of its members can be independent and autonomous.<p>When we say that the church is organic, we do not mean that it is an organism composed of our natural life. Rather, it is an organism composed of the life in our spirit, which is Christ Himself. The resurrected Christ is the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit enters into us who have received Him. Hence, within us we have the same life and the same spirit. In this one life we become organic, being joined together as one. The problem now is that we have two lives within us. One is the original natural life; the other is the Lord Jesus as our life. Which life are we living by? If we live by our natural life, we are not the church. If we live according to Christ and live Christ, we are the church. The church is Christ Himself in all of us. When Christ is in Himself, He is just Christ. When He enters into the saints and lives with the saints, the Christ within the saints becomes the church. The reality of the church is Christ living in us. The key to the building up of the Body of Christ is to live Christ. If we live our natural life, the Body of Christ will not be built up. For this reason we must deny and reject our natural life and must put the natural life aside. In this way, Christ will have the proper place within us and will be able to increase day by day. This is the building up of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ grows by the growth of Christ within us and is built up this way.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Economy of God and the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 26</div><br></body></html>
