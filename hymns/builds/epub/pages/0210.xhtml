<div class='line'><b>1</b> I've found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me,</div>
<div class='line'>He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;</div>
<div class='line'>The Apple-tree of trees, in Him alone I see</div>
<div class='line'>All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.</div>
<div class='line'>In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay,</div>
<div class='line'>He tells me every care on Him to roll:</div>
<div class='line'>He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,</div>
<div class='line'>He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> He all my griefs has taken, and all my sorrows borne;</div>
<div class='line'>In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower;</div>
<div class='line'>I've all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn</div>
<div class='line'>From my heart, and now He keeps me by His power.</div>
<div class='line'>Though all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore,</div>
<div class='line'>Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal:</div>
<div class='line'>He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,</div>
<div class='line'>He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> He'll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,</div>
<div class='line'>While I live by faith and do His blessed will;</div>
<div class='line'>A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,</div>
<div class='line'>With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.</div>
<div class='line'>Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face,</div>
<div class='line'>Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:</div>
<div class='line'>He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,</div>
<div class='line'>He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</div>
