   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN PRESENTING THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH 1 HAVING A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>CONCERNING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous chapters we saw the vision of the church and the nature of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this chapter we will consider how to carry out the vision that we have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We will consider the way to maintain a good testimony and a proper attitude among believers in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we desire to work for the Lord and be used by Him, we must have a thorough knowledge regarding the church so that we bear a proper testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must also speak the truth to others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our problem in the past was that we had a general impression concerning the church, without knowing how to give a clear presentation of this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, some saints misrepresented this truth, and others became confused.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>OUR FIRST RESPONSIBILITY BEING THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our first responsibility is to preach the gospel so that those who are not saved may know the gospel, know the Savior, have eternal life, and know salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The starting point of our gospel preaching is not to solve people s problems but to reconcile them to God so that their sins may be forgiven by the Lord and so that they may receive a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>First Timothy 2:4 says that God desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, obtaining eternal life is only the starting point for a new believer to live the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Obtaining eternal life is not the final goal of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a person is saved, we have to lead him step by step to know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One very important item of truth in the Bible is concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a rather complicated item of the truth and can be compared to a tangled ball of yarn.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The situation in Christianity is chaotic, but our standing and attitude are that what we hold and practice is altogether according to the truths revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not walk according to the outward situation, nor do we walk according to man s need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to what has been entrusted to us by the Lord, we insist on following absolutely the truths revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>BRINGING BELIEVERS BACK</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>TO THE WORD OF GOD AND TO THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Recently I was with the president of a seminary who said that the people in the local churches are always distant from believers in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though he was half joking, because of his age I dared not answer carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I responded that, based on the light that we received from the Lord, whatever we practice is according to the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After this he was silenced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Criticism that says that we do not cooperate with other believers is according to human sentiments and outward situations.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such criticism is not based on the truth in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as we can bring believers to the Word of God, they will admit that their standing is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their work is according to human need; they do not bring people to the Lord s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, we bring people to the Word of God, to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our speaking is built upon this solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE TRUTH CONCERNING</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE NATURE OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church has many aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, the life and nature of the church are out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second, the church is Christ s Body, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Third, the church is the bride of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our relationship with Christ is that of the bride; He is our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not only a matter of life but also of love.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Fourth, the church is God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fifth, the church is God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sixth, the church is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Finally, the church is the warrior fighting for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we speak with believers about the church, we must tell them that the church is not a physical building or a club for various social activities or an association of people from the same region.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church is the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the house of God, the kingdom of God, the new man, and the warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must present the nature of the church so that believers have a clear understanding of the biblical revelation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once a believer has this understanding, he has to admit that Christianity is full of division and far from this standard.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>KNOWING THE SITUATION IN CHRISTIANITY Division Being an Expression of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After more than two thousand years of history, Christianity has deviated from God s original intention.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christianity today is full of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to God s heart s desire and His Word, the Lord has only one church, and there is only one Body of Christ, there is only one bride of Christ, there is only one house of God, there is only one kingdom of God, there is only one new man, and there is only one warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, Christianity is full of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At present there are more than a thousand Christian groups in Taiwan, and each group has its own practices, doctrine, and flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, there is no oneness among them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the practical situation in Christianity, and such a situation is not pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some believers say that it is better to have more denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They say that in God s creation there are many varieties and species of flowers, grasses, and trees; hence, the church should also have many varieties.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you are a person who does not know the truth, when you hear this kind of speaking, you may think that it makes sense.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a result, some believers even ask why there should be only one kind of church.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This kind of speaking is an attempt to explain the confusing situation in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, division is strongly condemned in God s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The first chapter of 1 Corinthians says that there were four groups of people in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>One group said that they were of Paul, another group said that they were of Cephas, still another group said that they were of Apollos, and the last group said that they were of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Each group had its own excuse, but God did not justify any group.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On the contrary, God condemned them for being fleshly vv.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>12-13; 3:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Division is an expression of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Especially after Pentecostalism was raised up in the twentieth century, Christianity has been dividing into more sects.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>As long as a person has a so-called gift, he is free to set up a so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This situation can be seen everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, we must know the truth to see that this situation is absolutely not according to God s heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Christ does not have two Bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, we should not have any division.</S>
