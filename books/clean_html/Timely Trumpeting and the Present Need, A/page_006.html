<h2 class="head2">B. The Apostles Having the Duty and Authority<br />
to Remove the Elders</h2>
<p>Not only do the apostles have the duty and authority to appoint the elders, they also have the duty and authority to remove them (1 Tim. 5:19-20). Paul said to Timothy, &ldquo;Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses.&rdquo; This indicates that after an apostle has chosen and appointed men to be elders, he still has the authority to deal with them. In the book <em>Church Affairs,</em> we have a paragraph on &ldquo;The Church Listening to the Elders and the Elders Learning to Listen to the Apostles&rdquo; (p. 148). In the next paragraph, under the heading &ldquo;The Apostles Being the Ones to Remove the Elders&rdquo; (p. 149), we read:</p>
<p>After the meeting in Hangkow, some brothers misunderstood that though the elders are appointed by the apostles, they do not have to listen to the apostles. This is impossible. When there were brothers who did not respect the elders and problems occurred, the letter of accusation by two or three was sent to Timothy. In other words, the authority for the appointment of the elders is with the apostles, and the authority for the removal of the elders is also with the apostles. A local church cannot expel an elder; rather, the apostles need to bear the responsibility of removing elders. This is the reason why the letter of accusation by two or three was sent to Timothy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESPONSE OF THE CHURCHES<br />
(INCLUDING ALL THE SAINTS) ESTABLISHED BY<br />
THE APOSTLES TOWARDS THE APOSTLES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Having Fellowship in the Work<br />
of the Ministry of the Apostles</h2>
<p>The church in Philippi participated in the fellowship of the work of the ministry of the apostle. Philippians 1:5 says, &ldquo;For your fellowship unto the gospel from the first day until now.&rdquo; Through the gospel of Christ the apostles led the sinners to salvation and brought them in, thus raising up the church. For this reason, it is obvious that the church should respond to the work of the apostles and have fellowship in the work of the apostles. The work of the apostles is to build up the Body of Christ. All the saints in a locality should have a part, be responsive, and share in this work of the apostles.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Partaking of the Grace of Christ<br />
Experienced by the Apostles</h2>
<p>When the saints in a local church share in the fellowship of the work of the ministry of the apostles, they partake of the grace of Christ experienced by the apostles. Philippians 1:6-7 shows us that when the saints in Philippi responded to the work of the ministry of the apostles in the furtherance of the gospel, they became partakers of grace with the apostles. In the New Testament we can see frequently that wherever the Apostle Paul went, he went in the fullness of the blessing of Christ (Rom. 15:29). Christ, the grace in the fellowship, and the sharing in the fullness of the blessing of Christ, all follow the apostles everywhere they go. Hence, if a church breaks off its fellowship with the apostles, it will lose the grace and blessing of God. For this reason, we should have fellowship in the work of the ministry of the apostles and should further the work that is upon the shoulders of the apostles, so that we may receive the grace and blessing that the apostles receive. If a local saint or a local church cuts off its relationship with the apostles, it will lose God&rsquo;s blessing and grace. But if the relationship is kept up continually on both sides, the church will receive for itself a channel of blessing and grace, and there will be the participation in God&rsquo;s blessing and grace.</p>
