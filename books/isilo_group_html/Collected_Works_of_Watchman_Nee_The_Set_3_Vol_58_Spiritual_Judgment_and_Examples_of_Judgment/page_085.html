G.</h2><p>In reminiscing over my spiritual journey, I find that I was following a brother for a long time. Later I felt that I could no longer catch up with him. He was too fast for me. I tried to catch up but failed. In the end I could only stand still, and I finally sat down. I have been sitting for over ten years until today. When I was saved, I did not have any strong feelings, yet I definitely believed in the Lord. At one time I was very seeking, getting up at three o'clock in the morning to read the Bible and to pray. In 1927 I left my denomination. Once I was gravely sick, but later was healed. I also suffered from a plague. When the plague was rampant, I came across Psalm 91, and I was preserved from any harm. I have a son who became very sick when he was nine. He actually died a few times but came back to life again.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">A Strong Will</h2><p>First, our brother is a very calm and confident person. You know what you should do, and you are not easily confused. Those with a strong will are always confident about themselves. Yet for a Christian, a strong disposition is hard to break. If it is hard to break a person, it means that it is hard for him to go on. He has to be driven to the point of despair before he can experience deliverance.</p><h2 class="head2">Quick and Active in Thoughts</h2><p>Second, you are quick and active in thoughts. You have to hold your thoughts in check. Being quick in the natural mind is useless when it comes to spiritual things. The natural thoughts must be broken.</p><h2 class="head2">Self-assurance and Self-satisfaction</h2><p>Third, you are quite satisfied with yourself. Once a man trusts in himself, believes in himself, and justifies himself, he becomes loose, impolite, rough, and coarse towards others. This makes him an arrogant person. He will have friction with others, and his relationships will not be fine and tender. These are outward signs.</p><h2 class="head2">The Need for Spiritual Understanding</h2><p>Fourth, every time a Christian goes through an experience, there should be some spiritual result. Spiritual lessons have nothing to do with the number of outward experiences or their duration in time; they have to do with the result that is produced. In order to have spiritual results, one has to have spiritual visions and spiritual understanding. The lack of results in our brother from God's dealing may be due to the lack of supply from the ministry of the word. Or it may be due to his self-satisfaction, which turns away God's blessings. A man can reap spiritual results and enhance his spiritual understanding without the ministry of the word; he can produce spiritual fruit in the midst of all his experiences. Our brother needs a broken spirit before he can receive the ministry of the word from others. You have to wait in humility and drop your self-confidence before you can receive any spiritual good. While you are on the mountain, you have to see the spiritual pathway. Spiritual knowledge is very important. When something happens to you, you have to acknowledge the Lord's hand. There is a kind of oldness and sense of seniority with you. You have to repent and become like a child. You have to remove your self-satisfaction, self-complacency, and self-confidence before you can obtain mercy. Do not retain what you have heard here on the mountain as a doctrine in your mind. You have to receive it in your spirit. You have to have a new evaluation and a fresh view concerning yourself. You cannot go on like you have before. This is your way of deliverance.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_084.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_086.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 85</div><br></body></html>
