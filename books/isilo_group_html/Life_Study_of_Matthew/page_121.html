Greater Than All Who Were Born before<br />the Kingdom of the Heavens,<br />but Smaller Than He Who Is<br />in the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2><p>In verse 11 the Lord says, &ldquo;Truly I say to you, Among those born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is smaller in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.&rdquo; Although John was greater than all the prophets, he was not in the kingdom of the heavens. Compared to the Old Testament prophets, John was greater; but compared to the New Testament people, he was smaller. John was in a transitory period, greater than those who preceded him, but smaller than those who were to come after him. All the prophets prior to John prophesied only that Christ was coming, but John testified that Christ had come. The prophets were looking forward to Christ, but John saw Christ. Hence, John was greater than all the prophets. Although John saw the incarnated Christ and introduced Him to people, he did not have the resurrected Christ indwelling him. But the kingdom people do. John could only say, &ldquo;Here is Christ,&rdquo; but the kingdom people can say, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 1:21). Hence, the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he. Whether anyone is greater or lesser depends upon his relationship to Christ. Christ is the deciding factor. The closer anyone is to Christ, the greater he is.</p><p>The prophets prophesied concerning the coming of Christ, and John recommended the Christ who had come. The prophets said that Christ was coming, and John said that Christ was there. Although John the Baptist was close to Christ, he was not as close to Him as we are, for we have Christ within us. Christ is in us, and we are in Him. Because Christ is mingled with us, our relationship with Christ is most intimate. We are in Christ, Christ is in us, and we are mingled with Him, even joined to Him. First Corinthians 6:17 says, &ldquo;He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; What could be closer than this? This close relationship to Christ makes us greater than all those who preceded us. What a great blessing this is!</p><p></P><p>We need to realize in what age we are living. Peter, John, and even Paul were in the beginning of the kingdom age, but we are in the closing of this age. Where would you rather be&mdash;in the beginning, in the middle, or in the conclusion? Martin Luther was in the middle, but we are neither in the beginning nor in the middle, but at the end. Great men like Martin Luther stood on the shoulders of the early apostles, but now we are on the shoulders of Martin Luther and other great ones. Hence, we are higher than all of them. Even the smallest among us is able to give a strong testimony on being justified by faith both objectively and subjectively. Do not regard this day as an insignificant day.</p><p>When I was seeking the Lord fifty years ago, the situation was quite poor. We spent much money on books, and we traveled to see certain people. There is no comparison with the situation of today. Today you are all buried with riches. My only concern is that you do not have the adequate appetite. We are feasting every day. We are not in the transitory period, neither are we in the beginning nor in the middle of the New Testament age; we are in the conclusion of this age. At the conclusion everything is better, higher, and richer. Praise the Lord that we are so close to Christ! Many of the messages you have heard concerning Christ have not been heard by others in the past. Many of you were in Christianity for years. Were you ever told about the all-inclusive Christ? Did you ever hear about eating Jesus? But now we are eating Him and enjoying Him. Thus, we are greater. Do you dare to say that you are greater? According to the principle in the Bible, the later is always the greater. The last will be the first. Because we are the last, we are the greatest.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Being Elijah</h2><p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;And if you are willing to receive it, he is Elijah, who is about to come.&rdquo; Malachi 4:5 prophesied that Elijah would come. When John the Baptist was conceived, it was said that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah (Luke 1:17). Hence, in a sense, John may be considered Elijah who was about to come (Matt. 17:10-13). However, the prophecy of Malachi 4:5 will actually be fully fulfilled in the great tribulation, when the real Elijah, one of the two witnesses, will come to strengthen God&rsquo;s people (Rev. 11:3-12).</p><h2 class="head2">F. The Prophets and the Law<br />Having Prophesied until John</h2><p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.&rdquo; This proves that the Old Testament dispensation was terminated by the coming of John.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_120.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_122.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Matthew &nbsp; pg 121</div><br></body></html>
