   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE FIFTY-SIX SANCTIFYING, CLEANSING, NOURISHING,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CHERISHING 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s economy is not a religion, but a wonderful, unlimited, immeasurable, unsearchable, and all-inclusive Person, Christ Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ is the embodiment of God and the content of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This Christ is to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>NOT RELIGION BUT A WONDERFUL PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, in today s Christianity God s economy has become a mere religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Under the influence of this religion, Christians believe that God loved the world and gave His only begotten Son to die on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After Christ s resurrection, He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Until He comes back, we are to study the Bible and follow its teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But teachings are not the living Person of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s economy is not a matter of religion with doctrines and teachings; it is a matter of a wonderful, living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now this Person must become our person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our need today is not to be concerned with doctrine, but to be concerned with contacting the living Christ within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>RECOVERED TO THE SUBJECTIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many Christians pay more attention to the Bible than to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that even the Bible can be utilized to distract people from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Surely, we believe, respect, and honor the Bible to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But we recognize that the Bible is the revelation of the living Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not pay attention to the Christ revealed in the Bible, then we ignore the main function of the Bible, which is to reveal this very Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How we need to be recovered fully to Christ Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to be recovered not merely to the objective Christ in the heavens, but to the subjective Christ in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This subjective One is seeking to spread Himself into our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Not only is Christ our Savior objectively, but He is our life and our person subjectively.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to devote our full attention to such a subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul could say, Not I, but Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here Paul did not speak of the life of Christ, the work of Christ, or the power of Christ; he spoke of Christ Himself living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hallelujah, the very Person of Christ is living in us!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the foregoing message we pointed out that when Christ was in the flesh, He gave Himself up for us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This life-giving Spirit is the One we are to take daily as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As the life-giving Spirit, Christ is washing us, sanctifying us, cleansing us, nourishing us, and cherishing us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We shall consider these matters in this message.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>BECOMING HOLY DISPOSITIONALLY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps you have heard messages or read books about sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to know the true meaning of sanctification, we need to contact the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>One aspect of sanctification involves separation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be sanctified is to be separated positionally, to undergo a change of position.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, this is not the only aspect of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In sanctification something that once was natural gradually becomes holy in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, as we are sanctified subjectively, we become holy dispositionally.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This aspect of sanctification can be illustrated by the process of making tea.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When tea is placed in a cup of water, the water is tea-ified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>As the water is tea-ified, it becomes tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can compare ourselves to the cup of water and Christ to the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just as water is tea-ified by the element of tea, so we are sanctified by the element of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, to be sanctified is to have Christ Himself added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The more Christ is added into us, the more we have the appearance, taste, and aroma of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Day by day, our need is to take more of Christ as the heavenly tea into us so that more of His element may be added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In this way we shall be Christ-ified.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Suppose Christ were simply an objective Christ at the right hand of God in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Could we be sanctified dispositionally simply by trying to follow in an outward way the teachings of the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nothing of the element of Christ could be added into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We thank the Lord for showing us that subjective sanctification is a matter of having Christ added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The only way this can happen is by our taking Him as our life and as our person.</S>
