OF THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The nature of the work of the Holy Spirit is building, and the goal of His work is also building. The goal of His preaching the gospel through us is to have the building. We may not appreciate the building when we preach the gospel, but the Holy Spirit is working for the building. The Spirit does not allow a believer to be detached from the Christian community. The life a person receives at salvation requires him to be related with other Christians and to attend Christian meetings. This is the nature of the work of the Holy Spirit, and it is for the building. The Holy Spirit always joins every new believer, without exception, to other Christians. Hence, the goal of the Spirit&rsquo;s work in us is the building.</p>
<p>In church history the mystics were a group of believers who highly regarded spirituality. However, because they did not know the nature or goal of the Spirit&rsquo;s work, they focused on personal spirituality and came to an end. They went to mountains and caves in pursuit of God; they forsook everything and spent all their time to read the Bible, pray, meditate on God&rsquo;s Word, and exercise to be spiritual, but they did not have any results. This indicates that their way was not effective; the Holy Spirit was not working in their pursuit of spiritual cultivation. The nature and goal of whatever the Holy Spirit does in us are the building.</p>
<p>If the Holy Spirit enlightens us in our personal Bible reading, He will require us to fellowship what we see with the other saints. However, the Holy Spirit will not confirm our desire to display the flesh. If we disobey the urging of the Holy Spirit by not fellowshipping with others and by keeping the light we have received to ourselves, we will feel uncomfortable, and the light will diminish. However, if we fellowship the light we have received with the saints, the light will become brighter, because the Holy Spirit is working for the building so that we would be joined with the saints. If we would obey His urging and fellowship more, we will be enriched. The Holy Spirit urges and compels us to be joined with the saints by fellowshipping with them regarding all our spiritual experiences, including the breaking of the cross, the knowledge of resurrection, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This is a law.</p>
<p>Although in the past we did not emphasize the building up, there was still some building up among us, because this is the nature of the work of the Holy Spirit. We received God&rsquo;s blessing because of the building carried out by the Holy Spirit. However, we restricted the Holy Spirit because we did not see the matter of building and did not take the building as our goal. We need to actively cooperate with the Holy Spirit for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING A RENEWED CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>We need to renew our consecration to the Lord for the building. The book of Romans speaks of consecration in chapter 6 and in chapter 12. In chapter 6 consecration is for us to experience dying with Christ and being released from sin (vv. 6-13). In chapter 12 consecration is for the coordination of the Body, for our being built into the Body (vv. 1-8).</p>
<p>We must consecrate ourselves again if we want to receive the vision of being built up in the Body. We must say, &ldquo;Lord, I give myself to You again. I am offering myself once again for the vision that You have shown me. I want to be built up, so I consecrate myself for Your building work. I have consecrated myself for other things, but now I consecrate myself for You to do Your building work in me. I want to be built up together with all the saints in the church.&rdquo; May the Spirit lead us to have a renewed consecration for the building, and may He have the freedom to do the work of building in us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
