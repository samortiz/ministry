<h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR A CHANGE IN PRACTICE</h2>
<p>Such a study confirmed very much to me that there must be a change among us. Otherwise, we would be foolish. We may not take a mule wagon, yet we still may use the DC-4 of about forty years ago. Why would we not change our &ldquo;airplane&rdquo;? Jump out of the oldness and enter into the 747! We cannot change the truth, just as we cannot change the globe. But why would we not change the transportation? What is wrong with changing the transportation? This is not to change the truth. This is not to change the recovery. This is not to change God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. This is not to change the great mystery, Christ and the church. But surely we have to change our cold and old situation.</p>
<p>The Chinese young people have good parents who have brought to them ethics and morality with a good education. The young generation has been brought up in this good way. But today in Taiwan all those who do business, establish factories, and produce and export articles do not follow their fathers&rsquo; way. They pick up the American way to compete with the Koreans, with Hong Kong, and even with Japan. Taiwan has now had a great success and has become rich. Financially speaking, in the entire Far East Taiwan ranks second only to Japan. This is due to their improvement in the way of doing things, from the old way to an absolutely new way. They do everything in a new, scientific way, according to the modern standard.</p>
<p>I asked the young trainees why the worldlings would be so wise to change their way in doing things, but we should be so foolish. They all are taking the 747, but we still prefer the old mule wagon. A mule wagon could only travel thirty miles a day. At least three or four groups of Christians around us, some even in Taipei, have made great improvements. They all have attained to a good number. You may say that we do not care for numbers&mdash;we only care for life. However, without quantity could you have quality? Quality comes from quantity. How much life could you have with such a small number?</p>
<p>Twenty years ago the membership in Taipei was over twenty-two thousand. Those who took care of the name cards can testify to this. However, after more than twenty years, the membership had gone down to eleven thousand. The city had nearly doubled in population, but our membership had gone down fifty percent. It is foolish to remain there without any change. For this reason I told the young people to not take the old way. Even now you must respect the old generation in life and in truth. But in the way to practice the church life, to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, to preach the gospel, and to teach the truth, you have to repudiate the old way to the uttermost. We must no longer use the mule wagon, or even the old style of airplane. We must jump into the 747.</p>
<p>In the moral sense, you must respect your father and highly regard him, but in doing business, in teaching classes, in doing everything, even in packing a little package, you must not take his old way. You must go the new way; otherwise, you will lose the market and lose your job. Today all around the earth people are competing. Do not think that in the field of Christian work there is no competition. There is a great amount of competition. Not only in this country but even the more in the Far East, people take my ministry and use it for their own way. Our Gospel Bookroom in Taipei sells books to outsiders by the bundles. They know that what we have as far as the truth is concerned is the best. In Taiwan the others use these materials, but many in the church life just put them on the shelf and are indifferent towards these treasures. They remain in the old, routine way to have the meetings, to take care of the church, to do the work, to preach the gospel, and to preach the truth. Everything is done in a routine way.</p>
<p>If you do things merely according to a routine, even in the most scientific way, there will be no success. In every corporation or big bank, the employees in the office may do things according to routines, but the managers have to &ldquo;fast.&rdquo; Every founder, manager, or top executive &ldquo;fasts.&rdquo; They may not care for breakfast but utilize breakfast to get more business. They eat while they get business, but may not remember what they have eaten. They have no heart to eat. This is their fast. They have no heart to sleep; they work until midnight. A Japanese motorcycle corporation established a large office in Los Angeles and hired many Americans as clerks, who worked at their desk according to a routine, eight hours a day, five days a week. But in the back rooms the Japanese work until midnight. They do not know what Sunday is. They do not know what the weekend is. Their success rests in that, not in the American clerks.</p>
<p>I do not like to see that you co-workers and elders do a routine work, caring for the church in a routine way. Then the church would be reduced to nothing. If all the Japanese managers worked like the clerks in the front office, their corporation would be closed. In America professors in the top universities have a slogan&mdash;&ldquo;publish or perish.&rdquo; The top professors do not have a good stomach. They cannot sleep or eat well. They have to write something and get it published. Without publishing they perish. I encourage all the young ones to pick up such a way.</p>
<p>Especially with the Chinese, to have a change is extremely difficult. When western civilization and culture went to the Far East centuries ago, the Japanese received it. Then Japan became an important power, while China remained in the oldness to be robbed by the major powers. They all went to China to exercise their imperialism, but none of the major powers could carry out their imperialism in Japan. The Japanese picked up the new, scientific, modern, and up-to-date western culture. They were able to compete with the western powers. They changed, but China remained old. To have a change may offend the old generation. I am going to carry out a change according to the Lord&rsquo;s charge. This way is not for myself or not according to my feeling. It is for the Lord&rsquo;s interest.</p>
<p>A quarter century ago the church in Taipei had twenty-two thousand members. However, the membership went down. There was not much spreading or evangelizing on that island, even though the church there owns properties and has many halls. Because of the number of saints and the flourishing economy, the church also has much money. Recently, one hall had the feeling to spread and set up another hall in a nearby section of the city. Those who were there reported that they needed a large van for transportation. In one meeting without going home to consider, the saints gave five thousand dollars. For the thirty-seven and a half acres of land in Lin-Ko we had to pay eight hundred and fifty thousand American dollars. This amount was raised in almost one day from the halls of the church in Taipei.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 1985 one hundred and thirty young ones have come into full-time service. I visited their training occasionally to give some foundational matters and some principles. In just over two months sixteen teams with six hundred people were sent out for the gospel. The center, the nucleus, of that move was the one hundred and thirty young ones. Within three weeks they baptized one thousand nine hundred and seventy-five people. This came out from the absence of the old tradition. The sixteen teams went out in an absolutely new way.</p>
<p>I still have the burden to bring the Lord&rsquo;s recovery out of the old practice and into the new. This is why I called these urgent trainings. If I would not do this, all the churches in the West would only copy what Taiwan is doing. That would not work. You would merely copy the things of the new way, yet you would not take the new way. This is what the Lord likened to putting the new wine into the old wineskin (Matt. 9:17). The new wine will ferment and burst the old wineskin. If you do not have a change in the way of practice in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, yet you would imitate the points, this will burst your church life. It does not work. I am a little concerned. If you will not change, I would rather propose to you to not pick up any new points. Just go back to your locality and manage your church in the old way. Let me go to Taiwan to do something new in the new way. You are still safe. You will not increase much. You will not improve much, but you will still be quite safe. You will have no trouble. However, if you take the new way without a real change, you will make trouble for yourself.</p>
