   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST IN GENESIS 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have also seen Christ typified in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the first day are the Spirit of Christ, Christ as the word, and Christ as the light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the second day is the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the third day is the all-inclusive Christ as the land with all the riches and beauties of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the fourth day is Christ as the sun with the moon, including all the stars as a corporate, collective reflector of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>On the fifth day is the stronger life for the expression of Christ, and on the sixth day is an even stronger aspect of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually, there is a man as the all-inclusive figure of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ as a man is the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam was created in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is invisible, yet He has an image.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His image is Christ Himself Col 1:15; 2 Cor 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, Adam was created according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Adam was copied according to Christ, so he was a copy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The image of God is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ as the image of God is the declaration, the expression, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He declares God and expresses God John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because Adam was created according to Christ and is a copy of Christ, we may say that he was the duplication and multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the descendants of Adam, we are duplicates of Christ because we were made in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that we were made according to Christ in the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are the copies, the duplication, the multiplication, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God created man because He had the intention to have Christ multiplied, increased, copied, duplicated.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the very thought of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's intention, God's desire, is to duplicate, to multiply, Christ, the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ was the only begotten Son of God from eternity, and in resurrection He became the Firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was the very image of God, but now He is the first one of many images of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After God's creation, there is the duplication, the multiplication, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God created man, and that man is Christ in image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalm 8 and Hebrews 2:6-9 show that the man referred to in Genesis 1 is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is mindful of man and remembers man because man is the figure of Christ and the multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God remembers nothing but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God remembers you because you are the image, the expression, of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is mindful of you because you are one aspect of Christ, a duplicate of Christ, a copy of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God remembers you not because of yourself but because of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you have nothing to do with Christ, God has no interest in you and will discard you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God has a lot of interest in you because of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first time the Bible mentions something about man is in Genesis 1:26-28.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later on, in Hebrews 2:6-9, we are told that the man mentioned in Genesis 1 is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is something mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to see the central thought of God; then we will know what man is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man as a duplicate and figure of Christ was committed with the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God is the Head with the headship, but God committed His headship to this very man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He put everything under the control of this man, and this man in figure is Christ, who is the expression of God and the authority of God, the representative of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why do we Christians have to realize the order of God's headship?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Simply because we know something about man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man is the duplicate and multiplication of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With Christ, there is the authority of God, so we are under authority and have the order of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are not under authority, you can never exercise authority.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you are going to be the authority, you have to be under authority.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you can subject yourself to the authority of God, you can exercise the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Christ is the expression of God and the representative of God with the full authority of God's headship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the time of Genesis 1 God did not gain the real man of His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the church is brought into existence, the church with the Head, Christ, is that real man.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ephesians 4:24 and Colossians 3:10 tell us that the real man is the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church as the new man is the real man created according to the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Adam was just a figure, not the real man.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The real man is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Adam had the form of Christ, but he did not have the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Adam was just a photograph of Christ, without the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today the church has not only the form, the appearance, of Christ but also Christ as the living One, as life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church with Christ as life is the real man God is after.</S>
