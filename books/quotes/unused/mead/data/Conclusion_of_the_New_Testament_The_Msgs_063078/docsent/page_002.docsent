   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE SIXTY-THREE CHRIST HIS WORK 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As believers in Christ, we need a basic knowledge concerning Christ's person and work, which are the main constituents of the Christian faith.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have from the pure Word the proper knowledge of Christ's person and work, we shall not be misled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Having covered Christ in His person, attributes, and virtues, we shall go on to consider Christ's work.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We begin with His work in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. IN CREATION 1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Creating the Heavens and the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Since God is the Creator of all things and since Christ is God, Christ is the Creator of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hebrews 1:10, a quotation from Psalm 102:25, is applied to Christ and indicates that, as God, Christ created the heavens and the earth: "You in the beginning, Lord, have founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Christ is the origination and the source of all the created things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This proves that He is the very God who is over all and is blessed forever Rom 9:5b .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His creation of the heavens and of the earth began the fulfillment of God's eternal plan to carry out God's intention to have a full expression in man in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Him and through Him All Things Being Created</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Colossians 1:16 says, "In Him were all things created in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"In Him" means in the power of Christ's person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All things were created in the power of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, "in Him" implies that Christ is both the sphere and the element of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All things were created in Christ as the sphere and the element.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"Through Him" indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the process of creation was carried out in Christ and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ is related to creation in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not create the universe merely in an objective way as an objective Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not, so to speak, stand apart and call everything into being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, the process of creation took place in Him, that is, in the power of His person.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is the unique power in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>His person is this power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, creation was processed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that He was not merely an objective Creator but also the subjective instrument through which creation was processed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Creation took place in the power of Christ's person and through Him as the active instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is not only the Creator but also the One who is the means through whom all things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Speaking of Christ, John 1:3 says, "All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here we see that creation came into being through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For all things to come into being through Him and for nothing to come into being apart from Him means that apart from Him nothing has existence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One day, through Christ as the means, all things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, Christ is both the Creator and the means by which and through which all things were created.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Upholding All Things</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hebrews 1:3 says that Christ upholds "all things by the word of His power."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After creating all things, Christ became the Upholder of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For instance, after Christ created the earth, which has nothing visible supporting it, He began to uphold it, and He upholds it now by the word of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Christ upholds all things, and He upholds them very easily simply by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The universe is upheld by the word of Christ's power.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, Christ is not only the Creator and the means of creation but also the Upholder.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He created the universe, and now He upholds it by His powerful word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Speaking of Christ, Colossians 1:17 says, "All things subsist together in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For all things to subsist together in Christ means that they exist together by Christ as the holding center, just as the spokes of a wheel are held together by the hub at their center.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word "subsists" in Colossians 1:17 implies to exist, to live, and to live together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All things not only exist in Christ but also live, or continue in existence, in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, all things exist together in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The universe subsists in Christ as the center.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All things not only exist in Him; all things also live in Him and live together corporately in Him.</S>
