   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Breaking the Self</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The best way for the deacons to deal with the self is through handling business affairs in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A deacon experiences the greatest dealing in his self and his flesh; through the service, the self receives the most merciless breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is the best place for the self to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some people have said that the family and marriage are the best means of breaking the self.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, these things do not break the self that much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are with our own children, we are in control of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in order to serve as a deacon and fulfill our duty, we have to hand ourselves over; we cannot do as we please.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have an opinion concerning a matter, we cannot be silent about it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We may think that it is polite to retreat and keep quiet, but if we do this, our spiritual life will come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not behave politely, however, we will clash with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Problems only arise because our self is not yet broken.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the day we accepted our assignment as a deacon, we have to be ready to take the "suicide" way; we have to be ready to sacrifice the self on the deacon's altar.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's requirement for the deacons is that they not hold on to any opinion, idea, or feeling of their own.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They should only know to obey God's leading in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a very severe demand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please consider if there is any group of people on earth who is without any opinion or feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you want to be a deacon, you have to make up your mind the first day to put the self in God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to learn to humble yourself, to come under, and to reject all self opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The problem of the deacons is with their very own person; the problem is not with others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If you will not answer His call and take the lesson of the breaking of the self, you may become a deacon on February 18, but I guarantee that you will quit by March 18.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you make up your mind to answer the Lord's demand from this point onward, you will not have any problem with your assignment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Once you are willing to accept the breaking, you will not have any problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you do not have the self, how can you have any problem with the other brothers and sisters?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let me tell you a story.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In 1936 I was working and living in a certain place.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Almost every month I had to travel twice to another locality to settle disputes arising from service in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All the brothers loved the Lord very much, and all of them were for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>More than once when I spoke with them, they would kneel down and repent in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the same thing would happen again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They argued about their opinions because their self had not been stripped away by God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They did not allow God to put their self on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you want to serve as a deacon, you have to make up your mind from the first day to offer the self to God and allow Him to deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Bridling the Tongue</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In serving the Lord in the church, the deacons' tongues have to be bridled by God in the strictest way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a deacon's tongue is not dealt with, he will render as much trouble to the church as he renders help.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He will tear down as much as he builds up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the past when we asked a person to be a deacon, we asked him to speak little.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now when we ask a person to be a deacon, we ask him not to speak at all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As deacons your job is to exercise your hands and your feet, not your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the reason 1 Timothy 3:8 speaks of a deacon not being double-tongued.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A deacon has much contact with the brothers and sisters; he knows the saints more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He may know something others do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He may be aware of private embarrassments of the brothers and sisters which are hidden from others.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If he wanted to gossip, he would have much material to gossip about.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If your tongue is not bridled, you will be the top telegraph operator or communication officer in the church; you will easily broadcast news to your entire city.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the world everyone likes to exaggerate a subject in order to satisfy the lust for sensationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A deacon should find excuses to extricate himself from any conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He should not make any comment concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even when others ask, he should not be tempted to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He should always look for ways to extricate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a fellowship meeting, a deacon comes home and faces temptation immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As soon as his wife asks him something, he may spill out everything that transpired in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He may argue that his wife is probing, but actually, he wants to tell.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>A wife is not the only one who likes to ask questions; other people like to ask questions as well.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They like to hear something from you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When your wife or husband asks anything, you should answer in a gentle way, "You should not ask this, and I should not say anything about this."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I answer my wife this way all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we treasure God's church and work and if we consider them high and noble, how dare we talk about affairs and decisions in a light way?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even if the information we have is correct, we must consider the paramount question: "Am I allowed to speak of this in the first place?"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I often ask the brothers and sisters what they would say when others ask them about the subject of the deacons' meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have to say, "I am a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can listen and I can ask questions in such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I can even speak in such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once I walk out of the door, however, I have no right to say anything, and others do not have the right to ask me anything."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I hope that no brother or sister will discuss church affairs in private.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I hope that none will discuss the work under any circumstance.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should only build up, not tear down.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We should only edify, not destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If anyone has any feeling at all, he should speak up in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Once he steps out of the meeting hall, he cannot express anything to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is hard to find a brother or sister who speaks the same thing inside and outside the door.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When you ask for his opinion inside the door, he has nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He nods his head to everything, but once he steps out of the building, he talks loudly and expresses many things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The deacons have to learn to speak properly when it is their time to speak but remain quiet when it is not their time to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If they are not in the right place, touching the right things, and before the right people, they should not speak anything.</S>
