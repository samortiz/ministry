   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Please remember that in the Bible there are different ages.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From Moses to Christ, everything was revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Nothing was a mystery; everything was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It will be the same way in the coming millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the future the communion between God and man will be face to face, visible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is only in this age that the communion between God and man is neither like that in the past nor like that in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today we are in between the two.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot see God with our physical eyes, nor can we see Christ or the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This age is the age of the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, this age began with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Timothy 3:16 says, "And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From Matthew 13 onward, everything is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Previously it was open and uncovered, but now it is no longer so.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How the Gentiles are blessed by God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ in us is also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When does the Bible say that the mystery ceases?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It ceases at the seventh trumpet, not before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the whole church is raptured before the tribulation, then the mystery would be finished before the great tribulation begins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Bible says that the mystery is finished at the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the church must remain on the earth and not be raptured until the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Romans 16:25-26 says, "Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, that is, the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages but has now been manifested, and through the prophetic writings, according to the command of the eternal God, has been made known to all the Gentiles for the obedience of faith."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we compare what is spoken here with Revelation 10:7, we can identify places where they match.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, the subject of Romans is the mystery of God; the subject of Revelation is also the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, in Romans it says that God preaches through the prophets; in Revelation it also says the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Third, in Romans it mentions the gospel; in Revelation it also mentions the good news.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The original Greek word in these two places is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we can definitely conclude that the mystery of God in Romans and the mystery of God in Revelation are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They are of the same nature.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we take a blank sheet of paper and write Romans 16:25-26 on one half and Revelation 10:7 on the other half, and compare them, we would have to admit that they are talking about the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The only difference is that Romans tells us the beginning of the mystery, whereas Revelation tells us the end of the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Revelation, when will this mystery cease?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It ceases at the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no question about this point.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Resurrection and transfiguration are also a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians 15:51 says, "Behold, I tell you a mystery."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our friends think that this mystery ceases before the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the Bible says that it does not cease until the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only does the Bible say this; it continues on to give us even more proofs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 11:15-18 says, "And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And the twenty-four elders who sit before God on their thrones fell on their faces and worshipped God, saying, We thank You, Lord God the Almighty, He who is and who was, because You have taken Your great power and have reigned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And the nations became angry, and Your wrath came, and the time came for the dead to be judged, and the time to give the reward to Your slaves the prophets and to the saints and to those who fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This passage shows us further that both the rapture and resurrection have to wait until the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here is something quite particular.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the seventh trumpet sounded, the twenty-four elders fell on their faces and worshipped God and uttered those words of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The sounding of the seventh trumpet especially indicates that God has won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, this trumpet is unique because of its importance.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"And the time came for the dead to be judged."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many of the dead will be resurrected after the millennium and judged at the white throne.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>However, the judgment of the dead here comes right before the receiving of the reward.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So the judgment of the dead here is to determine who deserves the first resurrection and who deserves the second.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the judgment of the dead here is the time of the resurrection of the dead and the transfiguration of the living mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God judges to determine who is deserving and who is not deserving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This will happen at the sounding of the last trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Revelation, on the other hand, says that such a thing will happen at the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From this we can see that these two passages correspond to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"And the time to give the reward...to the small and to the great."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This happens at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It shows us clearly that the sounding of the seventh trumpet is at the end of the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once the seventh trumpet is sounded, the millennial kingdom will be in sight.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The preceding two proofs have shown us that the rapture of the saints occurs at the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the following section, I am going to combine several small points as a further proof that there are saints who will pass through the tribulation before they will be raptured.</S>
