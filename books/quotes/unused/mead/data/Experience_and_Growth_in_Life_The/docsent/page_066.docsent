   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>USEFULNESS AND CAPACITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Both the good and bad dispositions destroy our usefulness in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our usefulness firstly depends upon our capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 25:14-15 the lord delivered his possessions to his servants according to their natural ability.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Their natural ability equals their capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Apostle Paul was a very capable person with perhaps the largest capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if Paul had not opposed his disposition, his disposition would have destroyed his usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How much the Lord can use you depends upon your capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But regardless of how much capacity you have, as long as you go along with your disposition, you are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout church history, there have been many very capable brothers, such as Peter, Paul, Martin Luther, John Nelson Darby, and Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord used these brothers very much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I can testify that Brother Nee was not only a capable person with a large capacity but also a person who learned to always be against himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>CAPACITY AND AMBITION</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason for much of the political turmoil in the world and the present turmoil among us is because of two factors: ambition together with a lack of capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Someone may have the ambition to be the president of a country, but not have the capacity to hold such an office.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When such a person is frustrated from gaining the office of president, he may then cause trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the other hand, a person may be very capable, but if he has ambition, his ambition will destroy his capacity, his usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, ambition is a large element of our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a country is going to be a strong country, it must produce a number of capable persons, who have a large capacity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Yet these persons also must be against their dispositions, that is, against their ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A person who is capable and who is also against his or her ambition is the most useful person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If a country can produce twenty such persons in a generation, that country will be one of the top countries.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>CAPACITY WITHOUT AMBITION RESULTING IN USEFULNESS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Capacity without ambition makes a person very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the contrary, capacity with ambition damages a person's usefulness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Throughout history, the persons who have damaged entire countries the most have been people who were very capable but who were too ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hitler was an example of such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had a very large capacity, but along with his capacity, he had a terrible ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His capacity with his damaging ambition is the reason that Hitler damaged mankind so much.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Capacity is good, but ambition is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The principle is the same in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The most fearful thing in the Lord's work is a capable person with ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the other hand, one who is capable and without ambition is very useful in the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In my whole life, by His mercy, I met a person who was the best example of someone who was very capable but without ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That person was Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I can testify from my conscience that he was not ambitious at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His work was of the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did such a work, yet he did not keep anything for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church in Shanghai, another brother who was also very capable was Brother Yu, who was an eye specialist.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He translated the mystical books by authors such as Madame Guyon and Brother Lawrence into Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I can testify concerning him that he was also without any ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother Yu along with a few other brothers took the lead in the church in Shanghai and in the work, but there was never any problem with ambition among these brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, the church was built up, and many saints were edified.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Capacity without ambition means capacity plus the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Everyone is ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ambition is the primary element of every fallen person's disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even the lowest persons with a very low capacity are ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the church life, some are very capable and ambitious, and others are not very capable, but they also are ambitious.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet both can cause a great deal of trouble in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How marvelous it would be if everyone in the church life was against ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we all could be helped to live a life against our disposition, our ambition would be killed, and there would be no problems in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once ambition is killed in the church life, the usefulness of everyone, including those of limited capacity, will come out.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But when the disposition of the saints is not dealt with, ambition comes out, resulting in turmoil, the usefulness of the saints is annulled, and a great deal of devastation is brought in. A WARNING CONCERNING OUR DISPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If all the saints, especially those who are being trained to serve the Lord full-time, kill their disposition, everything will be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Otherwise, each trained one becomes a potential problem to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we pick up the training and practice it with our ambition and capacity, trouble will be the result.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If each trainee does not kill his or her disposition, each one is a problem and will be a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How useful you will be to the Lord or how much trouble you will make to the church depends upon how much your disposition is killed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, dealing with the disposition is a crucial matter.</S>
