OF THE KINGSHIP AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, in addition to Christ, who has the offices of the kingship and the priesthood, the redeemed ones have both offices as well. First Peter 2:9 reveals that the redeemed ones are a &ldquo;royal priesthood.&rdquo; The word <em>royal</em> means that we have the position and authority of a king. The word <em>priesthood</em> indicates that we have the fellowship of life. Revelation 5:10 speaks of God making us priests to reign on the earth. We are joined to Christ, and we have the offices of the kingship and the priesthood. Thus, we are able to meet God&rsquo;s need for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING OPEN FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the need for the priesthood to balance the kingship, that is, for fellowship to balance authority, we must open ourselves and release our spirit so that the Spirit of life can flow freely among us. The best way to open ourselves and to release our spirit is to pray. Once we open ourselves to pray, our spirit will be released to supply others. If all the saints open themselves to pray and release their spirits in the meeting, we will experience the living water of life gushing forth and flowing in the meeting, and the whole meeting will be an expression of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Some may be concerned about the topic of our prayer, but we should not be concerned about this. The topic of our prayer can be according to our situation at any given time. For example, since we are currently considering the matter of opening and releasing our spirit to fellowship, we can ask the Lord to open our spirit, release our spirit, and blend our spirits together. Having a particular topic is not the most important aspect of prayer. The most important aspect is to genuinely open up our spirit and exercise our spirit to pray. We need to use our spirit in addition to our mouth. We must release our spirit. If our spirit is released, even a seemingly insignificant topic will become a very good topic. For example, a number of brothers who come together to pray may not have a specific topic, but just their coming together is an adequate topic. They can open their spirits and pray, &ldquo;Lord, we thank You and praise You for gathering us together. We ask You to lead us so that we may touch You in this meeting. Lord, cause us to open to You so that none of us will be closed in our spirit and so that You may operate freely among us.&rdquo; This kind of prayer is quite adequate.</p>
<p>If our spirits are open, there is no limit to the topics of our prayer. Worshipping God can be a topic, giving thanks to God and praising God can be a topic, and building can be a topic, even the biggest topic. When we come together, we can pray for the building. We can say to the Lord, &ldquo;We would like to be built up, and we would like the church to be built up. We are willing to have a part in the building. Shine on us and show us what is not fit in us for the building. We are willing to let You remove it. We are willing to receive the breaking and dealing from Your hand.&rdquo; These are all possible topics. Hence, the topic of our prayer is not important. What is important is whether or not we will open up our spirit. Whenever we gather with the saints, we must always open ourselves.</p>
<p>When we speak of opening ourselves, we may think that this means to be blunt with others or even to point out their mistakes. This is not the meaning of being open. Being open means that our spirit comes forth. Whenever we come and meet together, we must be open to allow God&rsquo;s Spirit to flow into us and to flow through us. If the brothers and sisters are open in a meeting and allow the Holy Spirit to flow into and pass through them freely, our meeting will be full of supply.</p>
<p>In the past, our problem was that our spirits were not open. When we came to a meeting, our spirits were closed. This was true not only in meetings involving a message, but even in our prayer meetings and bread-breaking meetings. Our preference has been to be independent, watching others and receiving some blessing from them. We never had the thought that every meeting was an opportunity to open ourselves to God and to open ourselves to God&rsquo;s children. Hence, in the meetings our spirits were closed, and the flow of life was cut off with no avenue to flow out. As a result, there was a shortage of spiritual food and living water in the meeting, and people were neither fed nor watered. Moreover, there was even a sense of being unable to go on, because God&rsquo;s presence was not with us.</p>
<p>Such an abnormal condition in a church meeting is related to the fact that the water of life has no way to flow out. Our meetings should not be like a person who has all kinds of diseases because there is a problem of poor blood circulation. We need to focus on clearing a way for the circulation of the fellowship of life in the church. If the river of water of life is flowing through the church, there will be the bread of life and the living water of life; there will also be the presence of God and the way of God. Furthermore, this flow will issue in gold, pearl, and precious stones, ultimately consummating in God&rsquo;s building.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
