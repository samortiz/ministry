<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE PRAISE OF THE SAINT<br>IN HIS GOING UP TO ZION CONCERNING<br>HIS LOVE OF THE HOUSE OF GOD IN JERUSALEM</H2><P>Psalm 122 is the praise of the saint in his going up to Zion concerning his love of the house of God in Jerusalem. This is a sweet psalm concerning the psalmist's love of the house of God. This psalmist cared not for the law but for Zion and Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist's Rejoicing</H2><P>The psalmist rejoiced when others said to him, "Let us go to the house of Jehovah" (v. 1). Today we who love the church should rejoice when someone says, "Let us go to the meeting."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. His Praise of Jerusalem</H2><P>In verses 2 through 4 we have the psalmist's praise of Jerusalem, to which the tribes of Jehovah go up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Thrones of the House of David<br>Being Set There for Judgment</H2><P>"For there thrones are set for judgment,/Thrones of the house of David" (v. 5). David here typifies Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. His Prayer and Blessing<br>for Jerusalem's Peace and Prosperity</H2><P>Verses 6 through 9 are the psalmist's prayer and blessing for Jerusalem's peace and prosperity. In verse 6 he says, "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem./Those who love you will prosper." The "you" refers to Jerusalem. This verse expresses the intimate feeling of the psalmist concerning Jerusalem. Verse 7 indicates that the psalmist is concerned not for his own comfort but for the peace and prosperity of Jerusalem. Thus, in verses 8 and 9 he goes on to say, "For my brothers' and companions' sake I will now say,/Peace be within you./For the sake of the house of Jehovah our God/I will seek your good."</P>
