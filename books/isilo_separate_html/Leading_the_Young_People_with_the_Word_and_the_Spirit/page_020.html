<h1 class="title">LEADING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
TO KNOW THE LORD<br />
AS THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: June 2, 1961</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE YOUNG PEOPLE<br />
BY THE SPIRIT BEING THE REAL HELP</h2>
<p>Those who lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting must lead the young people to pray. This is a matter of great importance. There are several ways to lead a meeting. Some lead by emphasizing knowledge, and others lead by appealing to people&rsquo;s emotions. These kinds of leading will result in only a small amount of help. Strictly speaking, genuine help can be rendered only by leading the meeting with the spirit; hence, there is a need for prayer in the spirit.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves whether we are leading the college students with knowledge, related to doctrines, and emotions or with the spirit. We must lead them with the spirit. If we want to lead the young people to pray, we must be strong in spirit and have sufficient prayer ourselves. If we do not have a strong spirit and do not pray, we should not expect the young people to pray in the meeting. We must have a praying spirit, a spirit that is living and fresh, so that we can lead the young people to pray more in the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Prayer Helping the Saints to Be Open</h2>
<p>When I was with the saints in Baguio, there was much prayer. While we were on the mountain, the saints spent at least half of the time in prayer. Not many prayed on the first day, but the number of saints who prayed began to slowly increase. After seven or eight days almost everyone was praying in the meeting. They also had personal times of prayer, but most importantly, they prayed in the meetings. After breakfast and before the meeting, they would pray. There were also many opportunities for them to pray after the meeting. There was much prayer both before and after a meeting. Their prayer was very beneficial to them. Through their prayer, their spirit was opened, and the Holy Spirit was able to impart into them the message that was released in the meeting. Without prayer, it would have been difficult for the content of the message to be imparted into them. We must lead the young people to pray regularly so that their spirit will be open. In this way the word will enter into them and provide them with real help.</p>
<p>We must pay attention to this point: In our meetings we should do more than just speak, we should lead the young people in a way that causes their spirit to be open to the Lord. If our speaking is filled with only our logic and concepts, an adequate spiritual supply will not be rendered, and our message will not edify the young people. However, if we desire to lead them to be open before the Lord or to lead them to pray, our spirit must first be opened to Him. If our spirit is not fresh or living, if we do not have a spirit of prayer, and if we do not pray, it will be impossible to lead the young people to pray. If our spirit is weak because of a lack of prayer, we should not expect the young people to be able to pray in a strong way. Furthermore, if our thoughts are not logical and clear when we give a message, those who hear will not have a logical and clear understanding of the content.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Change the Concept of Meeting<br />
That Stresses the Truth but Neglects Prayer</h2>
<p>In both the young people&rsquo;s meetings and the larger meetings of the church, the matter of truth has been stressed to the neglect of prayer. In all the churches there is more stress on matters related to truth than to prayer. This has been a great shortcoming among us. Both the knowledge of the truth and the exercise of the spirit must be stressed equally. In a meeting the truth should be presented with a strong spirit that renders a spiritual supply to others. In every meeting we should release and open our spirit, and those who take the lead in the meetings should release and open their spirit. This requires much prayer. The more we pray, the more prayer we will have in the meeting. I am concerned that those who lead the young people&rsquo;s meeting spend much more time preparing for a message than in prayer. If there is an inadequate exercise of the spirit, only an objective knowledge of doctrines will be stressed. We must correct this situation by stressing prayer and the exercise of the spirit as much as the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p>In the conference and training in Baguio, we grasped this point, and we spent more time in the matter of prayer. Although sixty percent of the time was devoted to prayer and forty percent was related to the truth, the truth was ministered into them with a praying spirit. Hence, the help they received in the spirit was genuine and living. We must not pay attention to methods but to our person. If the leading ones do not pray, those under their leading also will not pray. Those who lack a spirit of prayer should not expect that those under their leading will have a spirit of prayer. The leading ones must exercise their spirit and pray much so that their spirit will be strong, fresh, living, and released.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
