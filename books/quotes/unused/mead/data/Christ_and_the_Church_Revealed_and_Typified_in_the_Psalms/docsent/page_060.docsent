   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HIGHWAYS TO ZION IN OUR HEARTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 84 also shows us the way to Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We go to Zion, firstly, by trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"Blessed is the man that trusteth in thee" v. 12 . Secondly, the highways of Zion must be in our hearts: "Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the highways to Zion" v. 5 . This is indeed interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whenever we take a way to reach a certain goal, the way is always outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the highways to Zion are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do you take the way of the church externally or internally?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Is the way of the church within you or without?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If it is outside of you, it will not last long.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The highway to Zion must be within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The only way to walk in the church life is not outwardly, but inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is not an external matter, but an internal one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sometimes people speak of the ground of the church and the practice of the church as merely external matters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I do not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They may, in a sense, be external things, but all these external things must be within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they are merely external to you, sooner or later you will drift away.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may be in the way today, but tomorrow you will go astray.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Praise the Lord, the highways to Zion are in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We take the Lord's way, we go the church way, not from without, but from within.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is absolutely not something external, but something which is very subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes we have the concept that the matter of the church ground and the church practice are not matters of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes we hear others say, "Let's talk about life; don't talk about the church ground."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In earlier days I had the same concept, but I've gradually been delivered from this kind of deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Never say that the church ground has nothing to do with life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is absolutely a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I am fully assured that if any one of you is wrong in life, you will be distracted from the way of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In other words, when you are out of the church way, you are erring, at least to some extent, in the way of spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The matter of the church ground and the way of the church practice has very much to do with the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are deeply in the inner life, we will certainly be in the way of the church; the highways to Zion will be within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we adopt the church life in a cheap way, it means that the life within us is extremely poor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But I do believe that many of us have taken the way of the church at a certain cost.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It did not cost me so much to take the Lord Jesus as my Savior as it did to take the church way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To receive the Lord Jesus as my Savior cost me almost nothing, but I can testify that it was very costly for me to take the church way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not imagine that the highway to Zion is external, superficial, and cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is quite the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is at a price that we take the church way and forever remain on the highway to Zion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE VALLEY OF WEEPING A PLACE OF SPRINGS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a person passes through the valley of weeping and makes it a place of springs.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It does not say that God makes it a place of springs, but that we make it such.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are always inclined to think that everything depends on God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But it is not God's responsibility to make the valley of weeping a place of springs.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether the valley of weeping is a place of blessing or not depends wholly on us, not on God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you take the church way, at a certain point you will encounter many trials and troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you turn away, you will find yourself in a real valley of weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if you are faithful at any cost, if you say, "Lord, even at the cost of my life, I will still go on," you will make the valley of weeping a place of springs.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You may consider that a certain brother is a real help to you; you enjoy fellowship with him so much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But I am afraid that one day this very brother will be a real problem and trial to you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may have a little foretaste of it now, but the full taste will come.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>More than two-thirds of my human life has been in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Under the covering of the Lord's precious blood I can tell you that my sorest trials have been from dear brothers, dear sisters, dear co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some of the closest ones have become the thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You may say that one brother is a trial to you, but one day you will be a thorn to him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If in the day of trial, you turn back, you will make the valley a true valley of weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I have seen many in the past who have done this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once they have turned away from the church, they have turned into the valley of weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But I must also confess that I have seen many who, in spite of all the trials, have still gone on in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I can testify that their weeping was transformed into blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The tears were transformed into springs, into rain which covered the valley with blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not suppose that I am passing on some kind of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My burden in sharing all the verses of these Psalms is to point out the attitude you must take to go on in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I have no desire to impart some form of knowledge about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The highway to Zion passes through the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This valley may eventually be a valley of weeping, or a place of springs, a place of blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It depends upon your attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the church is good and everything is fine, we may praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In these years here in Los Angeles, the church life has indeed been wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But it is altogether possible that it might not always be so good.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes the brothers may not be so lovable, to put it mildly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In fact, they may seem unbearable as far as you are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Sometimes the co-workers may not be so pleasant to you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Sometimes the meetings may not be so living.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then what will you do?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Will you quit, will you turn away?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Will you say, "What is the difference between the local church and the denominations?"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In fact, sometimes the local church may not seem as good as the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Will you go back?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Be careful; it all depends upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not God's responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is yours.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It is not God who makes the valley of weeping a place of blessing; it is you.</S>
