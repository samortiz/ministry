<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">GRACE AND REALITY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 17-18; 14:20-23; 1 John 1:5-7; 4:16; 2:23-24</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning grace and reality in the Gospel of John. Verse 14 in chapter 1 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; This verse shows that there is grace and reality because the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. When the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, He was full of grace and reality.</p>
<p>When the Word became flesh, God was mingled with man so that God could live in man and express Himself through man&rsquo;s human life and nature. In the flesh of the Lord Jesus, God became man&rsquo;s inward life and outward living. He became the inward content and outward expression of a man of flesh. He became flesh in order to raise up a tabernacle for Himself as His dwelling place among men. The Word became flesh so that God could be mingled with man and become everything to man. The Word tabernacled among men so that a dwelling place for God could be built. Both His mingling and His building depend upon grace and reality. If we want to receive grace and touch reality, we must be mingled with the explained God so that God becomes our inward life and outward living. Not only so, we must allow Him to do His work of tabernacling, His work of building, in us. If we take this way, we will experience Him as the One who is full of grace and reality. In order to receive grace and touch reality, we must allow God to do this work in us and on us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S SHALLOW CONCEPT CONCERNING GRACE</h2>
<p><em>Grace</em> is a very common term among Christians today. Many people thank the Lord for grace and praise Him for grace. Similarly, the term <em>reality</em> is also rather common. Every Christian wants to receive grace and touch reality. However, these terms in the Bible are special; they are not ordinary concepts based on our natural understanding. When most Christians consider the matter of grace, they think of something freely given and freely received. For example, out of love someone may buy us a very expensive watch as a gift. Since we have not paid for it, we regard this as grace. We cannot say that this is a wrong concept; however, it is ordinary. Many speak of grace in regard to a wide range of material things. For example, a person who has a stomachache may pray for relief, and when his pain stops, he speaks of receiving grace. Similarly, a person who is unemployed may pray for a job, and when the Lord arranges a job with good pay for him, he speaks of receiving grace. Another person who does not have a place to live may pray for a house, and when he finds an affordable and good house, he speaks of receiving grace. Sometimes, we even thank God for His grace when we were able to catch a bus.</p>
<p>Other people speak of grace in regard to spiritual matters, speaking of grace in relation to the forgiveness of our sins, which is based on the death of Christ on the cross rather than the works of law (Gal. 2:16). I cannot say that this is wrong. However, according to the context of John 1:14, grace does not refer to healing, good jobs, or affordable housing. Strictly speaking, it does not even refer to the redemptive grace by which we are justified freely before God. We surely believe that the Lord Jesus shed His blood on our behalf and that we are justified freely because of His redemption, but this is not the grace that is spoken of in verse 14.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BOTH GRACE AND REALITY BEING GOD HIMSELF</h2>
<p>Verses 17 and 18 say, &ldquo;The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; These verses tell us that grace and reality are nothing less than God Himself. Verse 17 speaks of the law and of grace and reality in a way of contrast. The law was given through Moses, whereas grace and reality came through Jesus Christ. Thus, the law is in contrast to grace and reality. According to verse 17, &ldquo;grace and reality came through Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and according to verse 18, &ldquo;no one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The sequence in verses 17 and 18 shows that God in verse 18 is related to the grace and reality that came through Jesus Christ in verse 17. Grace and reality came through Jesus Christ, and only Jesus Christ declared God; hence, the declared God is the grace and reality that came through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.&rdquo; To have grace is to have God, and to have reality is also to have God. However, verse 14 does not say &ldquo;full of God&rdquo; but &ldquo;full of grace and reality,&rdquo; because God is not simple. He is grace as well as reality.</p>
