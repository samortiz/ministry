   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SPIRITUAL AND MYSTICAL UNION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I would like to quote something from Marvin R. Vincent s book entitled, Word Studies of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Baptizing them INTO the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Into denotes union or communion with.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The name is the sum total of the divine being.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is equivalent to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His name is of no avail detached from His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When one is baptized into the name of the Trinity, he professes to acknowledge and appropriate God in all that he is and in all that he does for man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe we are clear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To baptize people into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit means to put them into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to Mr. Vincent, this is to put them into the sum total of the divine being, and this is a kind of spiritual and mystical union.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christianity tells us that Jesus was born simply to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Matthew does not end that way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew ends with Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, embodying the Triune God, putting all of God s chosen people into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And His presence is with all the baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Matthew tells us far more than just the saving of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matthew ends with Jesus baptizing all of God s people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And He is the ever present one with all those He has put into Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is simply the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not merely the saving of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is being put into Jesus as the life-giving Spirit, embodying the Triune God, that we may enjoy His indwelling presence in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>INTO THE TRIUNE GOD, INTO CHRIST,</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>INTO THE ONE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Matthew 28 speaks of the baptizing into the name of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But Romans 6 speaks of being baptized into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And Galatians 3:27 says the same thing: For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then 1 Corinthians 12:13a says that we have been baptized into one Body: For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So from these verses we can see that we are baptized into the Triune God, baptized into Christ, and baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we have some trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Are these three baptisms, or are they one?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they are one, how could one baptism put us into three categories of beings?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been put into the Triune God, into Christ, and into the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are we in three, or are we in one?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have been put into one because the Triune God is Christ, and Christ is the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To be baptized into the Triune God is simply to be put into Christ, and to be put into Christ is to be put into His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have been baptized into the Triune God, we have been baptized into Christ, and both Jews and Gentiles have been baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These are not three categories of separate beings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Triune God is simply Christ, and Christ today is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ in many members is one Body, and in one Spirit we have all been baptized into one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have the deep conviction that this is all very new to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But on the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, Christ as the baptizing Spirit, embodying the Triune God, put all God s chosen people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To be put into the Triune God simply means to be put into Christ Himself, and to be put into Christ Himself is to be put into the one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Now we know why Matthew mentions the Triune God in such a clear and emphatic way.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is because Matthew shows us how God became incarnated, born of a virgin to be Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we could not be put into Emmanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He had to go through some thirty-three years of process.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was processed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And the life-giving Spirit is the last Person of the Triune God, being His full embodiment and realization.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now Christ is such a Spirit, into whom we all have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whenever the church baptizes new believers, we must have the faith and realization that Jesus is baptizing with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For us to baptize others means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But in our baptizing, the Lord Jesus is putting people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That really is something.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He is the Baptizer, and as the life-giving Spirit, He embodies the very Triune God, into whom they are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are baptized into the Triune God, into Himself, and into His one Body.</S>
