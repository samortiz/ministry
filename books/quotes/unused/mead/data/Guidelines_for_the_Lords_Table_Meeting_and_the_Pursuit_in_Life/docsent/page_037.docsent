   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENTERING INTO THE EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF ROMANS 8 BY SEEING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: In my experience it takes me a long time to set my mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How should I experience this matter?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: At Paul s conversion, the light of the universe came to him and terminated everything in him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, because the law of the Spirit of life indwelt him, in every circumstance he endeavored to set his mind on the spirit, not the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, this is not our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After we were saved, we may not have seen much of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>After attending meetings for a period of time, we receive help and our inner being is unveiled a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This makes it easier for us to set our mind on the spirit, but it depends entirely on how much light we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more we see, the more we are able to set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, without consciously setting our mind on the spirit, our mind is already set on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The light that Paul saw was great.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He saw that the entire old creation was terminated on the cross, that Christ had become everything in him, and that He, as the Holy Spirit, had dealt with all things in him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, in Paul s living and service to God, there was no ground for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our experience, however, because of our inadequate seeing of the flesh, the Holy Spirit, the cross, and Christ in our daily living, we may be inwardly troubled, and it is difficult for us to set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As we receive more dealings and have more experiences inwardly, however, it will become easier to set our mind on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more we exercise, the easier it will be for us to set our mind on the spirit, and the more we will know that we need to stand with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, in our experience everything depends on the seeing of light.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing is more crucial than receiving light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please bear in mind that we are ushered into the experience of Romans 8 through seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If someone testifies that he has the experience of chapter 8 because of the help he received in chapter 7, we cannot completely discount this, but the fact is that chapter 7 cannot usher us into the experience of chapter 8 directly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our struggles and failures enable us to see that the flesh is incapable of pleasing God by doing good, that the flesh is unable to fulfill the will of God, and that nothing good dwells in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This causes us to be subdued and have no hope in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, if we want to enter into Romans 8, we must see two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, on the positive side, we must see that we are in Christ, that we grow together with Christ in His death and resurrection, and that we are in God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Second, on the negative side, we must see that the flesh is not only unable to please God, it is God s enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we see these two aspects clearly, we will not set our mind on the flesh in an effort to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will bow our head and tell the Lord, Lord, we give ourselves to You!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE REALM OF THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>BEING THE ENTIRE OLD CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Question: What is the definition of the realm of the flesh?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Answer: The ultimate definition of the realm of the flesh is the entire old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before the fall, man had only the created body but not the satanic life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the fall, the satanic life entered into man s body and changed man s body into flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Body and flesh are two different words in English and in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Man s body was created by God with clay before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, when the satanic life entered into man, it transmuted man s body into the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, the flesh denotes man s fallen body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only so, after the fall, man s mind replaced the spirit s leading function and subdued the soul so that the soul also followed the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God called man flesh Gen 6:3 and ordained death to be man s final destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, because of the Lord s mercy, we have seen that we are in Christ, that we have died and have been raised with Him, and that the Spirit of life dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, we must stand on His side and give ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is what we should and must do.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE RECEIVING AND THE PROPER APPLICATION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>OF THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Question: What is the relationship between the experience of the cross and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Answer: Before the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit had not yet been poured out, and the disciples had not yet received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In our experience, if we live by our flesh, it is unlikely that we will receive the outpouring of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even if the Holy Spirit descended upon us, if we are living by our flesh, we would apply this power in an improper way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Bible the first group of people to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit knew Christ s death and resurrection, and they allowed the Holy Spirit to dwell in them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Formerly they were in the flesh, arguing with one another concerning who was greater, with no comprehension of the spiritual things the Lord was speaking to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Acts 1, however, they experienced a drastic change while praying.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They no longer argued with one another regarding who was greater; rather, they were able to expound the Word that they previously could not comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fishermen of Galilee left their hometown, relatives, and occupation and followed Jesus the Nazarene with no reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They did not fear man s persecution and killing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This shows that this was not from themselves but from their knowledge of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Lord s resurrection they received the Holy Spirit and were able to live before the Lord by the Holy Spirit in them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They no longer argued in the flesh as before, and they did not want the world.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are typical examples of those who were used by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>On the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit descended on this group of people, they were able to be used by the Holy Spirit and could work by the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They had a realization of life and the inward ruling of the Holy Spirit so that when the outward power of the Holy Spirit was poured upon them, they could use it properly.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Within the past hundred years of church history, with the rise of the Pentecostal movement, many people who received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit have created many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They think that receiving the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is the same as receiving the Holy Spirit inwardly, that is, to receive the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They do not know that the regeneration of the Holy Spirit is different from the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In Acts 1, those who received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit were those who were praying in the upper room in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They were a group of people who knew resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since they were in resurrection, the contentions of their flesh were gone.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only such ones are qualified to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and can properly use the Holy Spirit who is outpoured upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some people, however, have not been prepared in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Hence, when the Holy Spirit is poured out upon them, they are puffed up because they have received the gift of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Furthermore, some people have the erroneous concept that they should feel elated after receiving the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For this reason, they repeatedly ask for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for their personal enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>However, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is not for one s personal enjoyment; it is so that the gospel may be preached to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When someone who is prepared and whose heart is pure receives the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, what he manifests will be normal; however, when someone with an impure motive receives the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, what he manifests will be abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, God wants to expose our genuine, inward condition.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>As a rule, if we desire to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we must have the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Without the experience of the cross, we can never use the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we have our own preference and pride, we will use the outpouring of the Holy Spirit to do all kinds of strange things.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hence, whoever receives the outpouring of the Holy Spirit must receive and apply it in a proper way; this requires the experience of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Without the experience of the cross, there will not be a proper response to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>During 1943 and 1944, there were some in the church in Tsinan, Shantung Province, who claimed that they had received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>One of the brothers walked on the floor with all four limbs, saying that he was the colt on which the Lord Jesus rode on the way to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Everyone watched him with godly fear.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After running intensely, this brother laid down to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In this way, the church in Tsinan was brought into a chaotic situation.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This shows that the experience of the cross was absent; they might have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but their flesh had not yet been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We can declare before the Lord that we do not oppose the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But in order for us to receive and use the outpouring of the Holy Spirit properly, we must pass through the cross; otherwise, it will eventually cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must remember that the outpouring of the Holy Spirit transpired after Golgotha, Christ s resurrection and ascension, and His entering into man to be man s life through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Therefore, we must know Golgotha and Christ s resurrection and ascension, we must learn to allow the flesh to pass through the dealings of the cross, be delivered from the earth and earthly attractions, and allow the life in ascension to solve all of our problems.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Then it will be easy to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit and to apply it profitably.</S>
