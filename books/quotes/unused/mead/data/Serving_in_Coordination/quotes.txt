[1]  We have already seen that we need to serve the Lord in the spirit, and that in our service the one thing we need to do is to minister Christ to others as life.
[2]  Whatever we do in the Lord s service, we must do it in the spirit.
[3]  In Romans 7:6 we are told that we need to serve the Lord not only in the spirit, but also in the newness of the spirit: But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.
[4]  However, if you serve the Lord in the spirit, you will surely have the newness of the spirit.
[5]  I need to serve the Lord in such a way that the more I serve, the more I will be built up together with others, and the more I serve, the more others will be brought in to be built up together with me.
[6]  The more you serve, the more you exercise your gift, the more you will be united, the more you will be coordinated with others.
[7]  On the first day that I come here to serve, I may do ninety percent of the things and leave ten percent in the hands of others.
[8]  But after one month, I am taking care of only sixty percent, and the other thirty percent has passed into the hands of some others who have come in to serve with me.
[9]  But if you would learn the lesson to be coordinated with others, you need to learn how to look down on yourself, how to be limited by others.
[10]  If you don t serve the Lord with others, you will never know yourself, but when you serve with others, you will be exposed how good you really are.
[11]  In serving the Lord in the way of coordination, the best test of your service is to check, after a certain time, how much of the service is in your hand, and how many more people have been brought in to your part of the service.
