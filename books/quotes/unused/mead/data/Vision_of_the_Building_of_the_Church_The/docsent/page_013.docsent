   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God Being the Life Therein</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First, we have to see that in Genesis 2 the tree of life was outside the corporate great man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we have the insight, we will see that the Adam who stood in front of the tree of life on that day represented not only himself alone but also all of his descendants throughout the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, that Adam was a corporate great man, and outside of that great man was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we see in the New Jerusalem, which is the composition of all of the redeemed ones throughout the ages as a corporate great man, that the tree of life has already entered into this man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, this picture shows us that the God who was outside of man in Genesis 2, has now entered into man and has been mingled with man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He has become the life of man, living within man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moreover, this God also flows in man as living water to water man, and He is also in man as the fruit of the tree of life to supply and nourish man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to have the real building, the church must have God as her life to flow, water, and supply her.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We often say that when a certain church is blessed, she is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be full of life is to be full of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In such a church God in Christ is flowing and watering as the river of water of life, and He is also supplying and nourishing as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way all those who are in the church can drink the water of life and eat the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only at this point can the church have the real building.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the first two chapters of Genesis the tree of life had not yet entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, there was no building at that point.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in the last two chapters of Revelation, in the New Jerusalem, the tree of life has already entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, all the saints can be built together into a structure as a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Having the Throne of God</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second, in this city of the New Jerusalem, the corporate great man, there is the throne of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God, and the tree of life grows on both sides of the river.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The meaning of this picture is that within this corporate man there must be the reigning of God; that is, God must be on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When God reigns, His life will flow out of the reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, please remember that although there may be confusion and lawlessness everywhere else, in the church built by God everything must be absolutely in order, because the throne of God is here and God s authority is here.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this age when you go and look at the societies among the human race, it is difficult to find one that is not in confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Almost all of them are full of opinions, criticism, judging, and attacking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, please remember that although this may be acceptable in human society, it cannot be so in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there is quarreling, opinions, gossip, criticism, judging, and attacking in a local church, then you know that that church has lost the nature of building, since she has lost the throne of God and the authority of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we want God to have the building in the church, then there must be the throne of God in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only when we have God s authority with everything under the ruling of God and everything in perfect order will the life of God be able to flow and to supply.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God and the Lamb Being the Temple of the City</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Third, this city, New Jerusalem, is different from the city of Jerusalem in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Old Testament there was a temple in the city, but in the New Jerusalem there is no temple, because God and the Lamb are the temple of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This shows us that this city is full of the presence of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The presence of God and of the Lamb is the temple of this city.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the same way, whenever someone comes into a church that has been built up, he cannot but bow his head and worship, saying, God is here.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This place is full of the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a church does not merely have some religious rituals and a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, what people meet is God Himself, and what they touch is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The presence of God and of Christ becomes the temple, the center of man s worship.</S>
