<p>We often live in our wandering mind, thinking about many things. As a result, we are turned away from our spirit. Our mind can even travel around the world. Evil people often think about evil things, and good people often think about good things. However, both evil and good people live in their mind, not in their spirit. Now that we are learning to live in the fellowship of the divine life, we should no longer live in the realm of good and evil. Instead, we should pay attention to whether or not we are living in our spirit.</p>
<p>When we love a certain thing, we should ask ourselves whether our love is from our spirit. If we love something as soon as we think about it, our love is not from our spirit. However, if we first turn our mind to our spirit and touch the sense within, the love that we express will come from our spirit. Similarly, if we hear an admonition and immediately adjust ourselves, this adjustment is not from our spirit. After hearing an admonition, we should immediately turn our mind to our spirit and live out what we touch in the divine fellowship. Then, if there is any adjustment, it will be an expression of life. As we learn to fellowship, we should always care for our spirit, not for good and evil. We should reject whatever is not of our spirit, even if it is very good. We should not make decisions based on the circumstances of persons, matters, or things. Every decision must be made according to the sense in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Always Turning Our Mind to Our Spirit</h2>
<p>Everything that is apart from the Lord can draw us away from our spirit; praying and reading the Bible are not exceptions. Hence, we must learn to turn our mind to our spirit in every situation. A brother who can turn his mind from outward things to his spirit will become skilled in fellowship. This is the secret to genuine Christian experience, including the life, power, light, and authority of a believer. When a sister reads a spiritual book, she should seek the supply that is in her spirit. The book should not draw her mind from her spirit. The same principle applies to prayer. We should turn our mind to our spirit when we pray. Strong and thorough prayers are uttered when our mind is subject to our spirit and when our entire being is turned from our environment to our spirit. The longer we can remain in our spirit, the stronger our spirit will become. The more we live such a life, the stronger the meetings will be. Many brothers and sisters do not open their mouth in the meetings because their mind is turned from the spirit. Those who constantly turn their mind to the spirit can pray in any situation. Not only so, as soon as they open their mouth, their spirit is released. Only those who often turn their mind to their spirit know the sense in their spirit, receive light when they read the Bible, and are effective in the work.</p>
<p>While learning to fellowship, we should pay attention to our spirit, not to good and evil, because we cannot touch God unless we turn to our spirit. God is Spirit and life, and He dwells in us. May we not be those who turn from God but those who turn to God by touching the fellowship of life in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Intention Being<br />
That We Be Filled with Him</h2>
<p>Before the fall man lived before God, but after the fall man entered into the realm of good and evil. When we were saved, we returned to God&rsquo;s presence, and God entered into us. Good and evil are not the goal of a genuine Christian living. The genuine Christian living takes the indwelling God as its center. Hence, our Christian living should come from our mingled spirit, not our soul. The people in the world do not have God in them, nor do they live before Him. As a result, they live in the realm of good and evil, right and wrong.</p>
<p>Throughout human history there have been many sages and religionists, who taught that we should reject evil and pursue good. There are even quite a few believers in Christianity who regard the Lord&rsquo;s salvation merely as a solution to problems related to good and evil. Salvation, however, is not focused on solving problems related to good and evil. Salvation delivers us from the realm of good and evil to the realm of God. The purpose of salvation is not to deliver us from evil to good but to deliver us from everything that is apart from God to God Himself. In His eternal plan, God did not ordain that we be good men; He ordained that we be God-men. God does not desire to fill us with so-called goodness. He desires to fill us with Himself.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is for us to be mingled with Him and to let Him live in us by taking Him as our life so that our entire being would be filled with His divine element. He not only wants us to have His life in our spirit, but He also desires that every part of our being&mdash;including our mind, emotion, and will in our soul and every part of our heart&mdash;would be filled with His life and nature. Eventually, even our physical body, which He made from the dust of the earth, will be filled with His divine element and conformed to His glorious body (Phil. 3:21). In order for God to accomplish His purpose, we must learn the lesson of fellowship, that is, learn to forget good and evil and turn to our spirit to touch God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
