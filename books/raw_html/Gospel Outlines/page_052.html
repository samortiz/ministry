<h1 class="title">WHEN WILL YOU BE SAVED?&mdash;DO NOT DELAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Jer. 8:7, 20</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The meaning of being saved
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is sinful and dead.</li>
	<li>To be saved is to be forgiven of sins and receive God&rsquo;s life.</li>
	<li>To be saved also means to be delivered from sins, the world, and death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The importance of being saved
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Man is under condemnation.</li>
	<li>There is the possibility that a man could perish at any time, because there is the possibility that he could encounter death at any time.<br />
	These two points show that man is already under condemnation. Before man&rsquo;s death, however, God still gives man opportunities to be saved from perishing eternally.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Salvation is related to time
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Time provides opportunities for people to be saved. Time is the opportunity. All opportunities are in time. Losing time is losing the opportunity. This is why men always try to make use of time in whatever they are doing.</li>
	<li>When time is past, there will be no more opportunity. <em>This point should be stressed.</em> Here, apply the verse, &ldquo;The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.&rdquo; The time for harvest is past, the summer is over, but we are not yet saved; nevertheless there is still time, still an opportunity left&mdash;now. If we let it go by, no one can say whether this opportunity will come again.</li>
	<li>It should be concluded that salvation must be in time. To be saved is not in eternity, although it is for eternity. Salvation must be in time. This time is this present life. This present life may be finished at any time. Give some examples and stories. Some who heard the gospel but did not believe it right away were killed in car accidents on their way home. Use some examples to prove that man&rsquo;s life may be finished at any time in this world. When time is past, eternity will come. Therefore, you must believe Him today. Sing verse 3 of hymn #1043 in <em>Hymns.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Grasp this opportunity
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Emphasize that the opportunity is now. After this moment, there may be no more opportunities.</li>
	<li>To grasp the opportunity is to grasp this moment. Those who want to grasp the opportunity must grasp this moment right now.</li>
	<li>Ask those who want to grasp this opportunity right now, to please stand up. Sing the chorus of hymn #1042, &ldquo;Why not now? Why not now?&rdquo;</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
