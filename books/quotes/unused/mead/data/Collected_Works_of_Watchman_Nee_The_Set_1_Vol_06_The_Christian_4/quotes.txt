[2]  GOSPEL MESSAGES MESSAGE ONE PEACE WITH GOD Issue No. 1
[3]  Salvation or perdition depends on whether or not you are at peace with God.
[4]  If you are at peace with God, you are very secure because you have passed from death to life and received the blessing God has prepared in the Lord Jesus.
[5]  But if you are not at peace with God, you are in a dangerous and pitiful condition because God's wrath abides upon you.
[6]  He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to the world to die on the cross for us, to be our propitiation, and to propitiate God's righteous wrath.
[7]  Before the Lord Jesus accomplished salvation, God loved the world, but the sin of the world forbade Him from drawing near to men and forbade men from drawing near to God.
[8]  He Himself came to be a man the Lord Jesus is God and He suffered on the cross to pay the debt of sin for us; He has changed the relationship between God and man.
[9]  God's way is "peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ" Rom 5:1 , and to be "reconciled to God through the death of His Son" v. 10 . It is not your own merit that puts you at peace with God.
[10]  But if you are not reconciled to God through the death of the Lord Jesus and have not believed that His death is for the accomplishment of salvation and for the bearing of your sins, you are still God's enemy and a perishing sinner.
[11]  If God considered the death of the Lord Jesus to be necessary, He will not be satisfied with anything less than the death of the Lord Jesus.
[12]  MESSAGE TWO CAN MORALITY SAVE US Issue No. 3
[13]  The translation of the Chinese title for this message is "Can Man Be Saved by Doing Good."
[14]  Spurgeon concluded that if God expected him to do good before he could be saved, then he would not want to be a Christian in the first place because he would find out after striving for many years on earth that God would not be satisfied with him and whatever he would have done would have been in vain.
[15]  Although it is true that God is not satisfied with our works, and although it is true that we do not have any merit of our own, He is pleased in His Son, the Lord Jesus.
[16]  Many people today think that even though salvation is of God's grace, we should, nevertheless, have our work.
[17]  They think that God's grace should be supplemented with our work before we can be saved; otherwise, we will still perish.
[18]  Alas, the man in the flesh always wants to be saved by his own self!
[19]  Therefore, sinners, if you want to be saved, you must never think that you should do good, or that doing good will help you to be saved.
[20]  Ephesians 2 does not stop at the teaching that salvation is of grace and through faith; it goes on to teach about the nature of salvation.
[21]  "This" salvation is first "not of yourselves; it is the gift of God"; and second "not of works that no one should boast" vv.
[22]  If you do not receive, no matter what kind of person you are, you will still perish.
[23]  Why would you not come before God with a contrite heart, confessing that you are a sinner, that you have no goodness to boast of, no merit to depend on, and trust solely in the grace that God has given you through the cross of His Son?
[24]  If you do not believe in the Savior who has died for you and has borne your sins, whatever good you have done and whatever position you occupy will not change you from being a perishing man.
[25]  MESSAGE THREE THE SUFFERING OF THE CROSS Issue No. 5
[26]  Whenever the Holy Spirit touches me to consider how the Lord Jesus Christ died for me, a sinner, so that I could be free from the punishment of sin and have eternal life, I thank Him with tears for His grace.
[27]  "O my Lord, how piteous You were to die on lonely Calvary for my sins!"
[28]  The Lord Jesus was the God of glory in heaven.
[29]  I wish that you knew this and that through the love of the Lord Jesus, you would right now be moved to believe in this kind Savior.
[30]  Then men took Christ, bound, from Annas to Caiaphas.
[31]  The Bible says that He was bound as a criminal.
[32]  He stood in the position of a sinner, and He suffered what sinners deserve, in order to save them.
[33]  When He was before the high priest, "they spit in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him" Matt 26:67 .
[34]  The Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross.
[35]  Look at His forehead, bleeding from the piercing of thorns!
[36]  You should consider His sufferings so that, on the one hand, you may know His love and, on the other hand, realize the suffering of the coming judgment if you do not believe in Him.
[37]  MESSAGE FOUR THE LAMB OF THE PASSOVER Issue No. 7 Scripture Reading: Exo 12
[38]  God's people, the Israelites, were enslaved in Egypt for many years.
[39]  God saw their affliction and brought down ten plagues upon the Egyptians to punish them so that they would release His chosen people.
[40]  But if you know that you are a sinner under the judgment of God and cannot escape His righteous judgment, and you wish to be saved, there is a saving way.
[41]  Although you may speak about the excellency of Christ's humanity and the loftiness of His morality, only He is excellent and only He is lofty.
[42]  God does not want us to imitate Christ with our own efforts so that we can be saved.
[43]  "Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows / ...But He was pierced because of our transgressions; / He was crushed because of our iniquities; / The chastening for our peace was upon Him, / And by His stripes we have been healed" Isa 53:4-5 .
[44]  If we merely take Jesus as a model, intending to imitate Him as a means of salvation, we will end up perishing because there is no one on earth who can be like the Lord Jesus.
[45]  Because you have not exercised your faith to receive the Lord Jesus as your personal Savior, your knowledge cannot help you at all, and you are still a man bound for hell!
[46]  Although you know that the Lord Jesus has died for you, you will still perish if you do not exercise faith to apply His blood on the upper doorpost of your heart.
[47]  On that night the Israelites used hyssop to dip in the blood and strike on the upper doorpost.
[48]  If you want to rely on the precious blood of the Lord Jesus, you must have your own hyssop.
[49]  According to the Scripture, hyssop is the smallest of all plants 1 Kings 4:33 and is despised by men.
[50]  Speaking truthfully, I have never seen a proud man who can believe in the Lord Jesus.
[51]  Unless we see ourselves as sinners and are willing to stand in the position of a sinner, we will not receive the Lord Jesus as our Savior.
[52]  If anyone knows about the salvation of the Lord Jesus but does not accept Him with faith, he is in danger.
[53]  What a pity that so many who have believed in the Lord Jesus do not know that they are secure and will not come into judgment!
[54]  If you are not saved, even if you have believed in the Lord Jesus, then has not the Word of God become void?
[55]  I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God...He who does not believe God has made Him a liar because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son" 1 John 5:9, 11-13, 10 .
[56]  Many people cannot understand how someone can be saved merely by believing in the Lord Jesus.
[57]  Their difficulty lies in being unable to feel that they have been saved.
[58]  I often hear people saying, "I have truly believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior, but in my heart I still cannot feel that I am saved."
[59]  Let us read Exodus 12:13, "And when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you."
[60]  God said that He would see the blood, and when He saw the blood, He would not smite us.
[61]  The Scripture does not say that we are saved when we feel that we are saved, and that if we do not feel so, then we will perish.
[62]  God saves us because of the precious blood of the Lord Jesus and only because of the precious blood of His Son, not because of a change in ourselves or in our conduct.
[63]  MESSAGE FIVE WHY GOOD MEN GO TO HELL Issue No. 9 Scripture Reading: Luke 18:9-14
[64]  This portion of the Bible is a parable told by the Lord Jesus Christ Himself.
[65]  He said that two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, one of the best of persons, and the other was a tax collector, one of the worst of persons.
[66]  The Lord Jesus said that as a result of their prayers, the wicked tax collector was justified and the good Pharisee was not justified.
[67]  We all think that the good person should go to heaven and the wicked to hell, but the Lord Jesus said that the good person would go to hell and the wicked person to heaven.
[68]  We should remember that he said to God, "I am not like the rest of men."
[69]  Many times when I preach the gospel, I ask, "Do you know that you are a sinner and that you need a Savior as a substitute to redeem you?"
[70]  Many have replied, "I have never killed anyone and burned down buildings.
[71]  Yes, maybe you can say this to me, but can you say to the Lord, "God, I thank You that I do not sin like the rest of men.
[72]  What you dare to say before men, you dare not say before God because God examines your inward parts.
[73]  He not only boasted to men that he was a perfect and righteous man, unlike others who had committed sins, he dared to say even to God, "God, I thank You that I am not like the rest of men extortioners, unjust, adulterers."
[74]  The Pharisee not only abstained from many evil things on the negative side, but did many commendable things on the positive side.
[75]  He "fast ed twice a week" v. 12 . I am afraid that many people have never fasted once since they became a Christian! They may not even know what it means to fast! But this Pharisee was very strict; he mastered his body and did not give in to the passion of his lust.
[76]  If we think that we can be saved by doing good or that we are saved because we are good, we should realize that even if we are as good as this Pharisee, we still cannot be saved.
[77]  He not only was one who "trusted in themselves that they were righteous" but also "exalt ed himself" v.
[78]  If a man wants to be saved, he must admit that he is a helpless and hopeless sinner, unable to save himself and unable to trust himself.
[79]  The Lord Jesus said, "For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" Matt 9:13 .
[80]  He also said, "For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which is lost" Luke 19:10 .
[81]  If you are a righteous man, His coming is not to call, seek out, and save you.
[82]  But He will save you if you admit that you are a sinner and are lost.
[83]  Although this tax collector was a sinner, who should have perished, he was saved because he did not pretend to be a person without sin.
[84]  He came to God not to ask God to help him change himself when he went home because he knew that he could not change.
[85]  He would perish because he had sins and did not have the One who could substitute for the punishment for sins.
[86]  If you do not receive the Lord Jesus to be your Savior and if you do not believe that His death was for you, you will surely perish.
[87]  Yet God caused the Lord Jesus to die for us on the cross, so that when we believe in Him and receive Him as our Savior, we will be saved.
[88]  We will first read two sections of the Bible.
[89]  Mark 15:27-32 tells about the Lord Jesus being crucified on the cross.
[90]  "And with Him they those who nailed the Lord Jesus crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left....And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha!
[91]  But the other, answering, rebuked him and said, Do you not even fear God, since you are in the same judgment?
[92]  You may be a great sinner; you may think that you do not deserve to be saved but rather should perish, but God has decided to grant you grace and give you salvation.
[93]  We do not know why this robber, who joined the other robber and with the same heart and same voice mocked the Lord Jesus in the beginning, suddenly changed and believed in Christ.
[94]  It took away his prejudice, melted his evil heart, and caused him to realize that the One nailed beside him was indeed Christ, the Son of God.
[95]  The cross of the Romans had hardened his heart to mock Christ, but the cross of the Lord Jesus caused him to repent and believe in the Savior.
[96]  We have seen how this robber rebuked his companion, expressing his own faith.
[97]  Now we want to also see that he not only expressed his faith by rebuking his companion, but in his confession he declared that he had believed in the Lord Jesus.
[98]  "And we justly, for we are receiving what we deserve for what we did."
[99]  Saying that you have no sin because you act according to your conscience is not altogether true, because I do not know what kind of conscience you have.
[100]  If you will not allow the Holy Spirit to prove to you by the Scripture that you are a sinner, and if you resist God's evaluation concerning you and do not acknowledge that you are a sinner, it will be impossible for you to receive God's salvation.
[101]  The robber not only rebuked the other robber and confessed that he himself was a sinner, but he also confessed that the Lord Jesus had no sin.
[102]  "But this Man meaning the Lord Jesus has done nothing amiss."
[103]  Two of us are robbers, and this manner of execution is indeed just; but this Man, Jesus Christ, did not commit sin.
[104]  Through his rebuke, his confession of sin, his acknowledgment of the Lord, and his prayer, the robber expressed his faith.
[105]  We may say that it was the most difficult time for him to believe in the Lord.
[106]  Dear friends, if you do not believe in Jesus Christ, I beg you and I urge you today to believe in Him immediately.
[107]  Now let us see how the Lord Jesus answered the robber.
[108]  "And He said to him, Truly I say to you, Today you shall be with Me in Paradise."
[109]  Therefore, the Lord Jesus Christ promised, "You are saved today; you already have eternal life; heaven is assured for you."
[110]  If you believe today, you will be saved today; you do not have to wait until you die and stand before God to find out.
[111]  "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life."
[112]  The Lord Jesus is still saying to every sinner who believes in Him, "You do not have to wait until I come again to judge, before you can have eternal life; you have been saved now."
[113]  The robber was not saved because of his good behavior.
[114]  He could not do good, nor had he ever done any good.
[115]  But in observing your daily walk and your attitude towards the Lord Jesus Christ, I reckon that all of you want to go to hell, want to perish, and want to go into perdition.
[116]  Suicide terminates any hope of salvation for a person.
[117]  Consequently, such a person will surely go to hell.
[118]  As long as this person is still alive on the earth, he may still be able to hear the gospel of the Lord Jesus' substitutional death; he may still believe and be saved.
[119]  But if he kills himself, he will destroy, cut off, and annul all chances to hear the gospel and be saved.
[120]  When it is time for you to die, if you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will not have another chance to hear the gospel and be saved.
[121]  I told them very frankly, "If you want to go to hell, you should kill yourselves, and if you kill yourselves, you will surely go to hell."
[122]  "And if your hand stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life maimed than to have two hands and go away into Gehenna, into unquenchable fire.
[123]  And if your foot stumbles you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter into life lame than to have two feet and be thrown into Gehenna.
[124]  And if your eye stumbles you, cast it out; it is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into Gehenna, where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched" Mark 9:43-48 .
[125]  It welcomes anyone who wants to go in. If you want to go there to suffer an eternal suffering and receive the punishment of God's wrath, I can tell you that you can sin at will; you can do whatever pleases your heart.
[126]  Let us now read a few verses of the Scripture.
[127]  Therefore, we see a man who thought that he had no sins but who was, nevertheless, condemned by God; and we also see a man who thought that he did have sins who was declared sinless by God.
[128]  If you do not confess that you are a sinner, no matter how many answers you have received to difficult questions, you will not be helped to believe in Christ.
[129]  Let us first read a verse: "How Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, who in like manner with these gave themselves over to fornication and went after different flesh, are set forth as an example, undergoing the penalty of eternal fire" Jude 7 .
[130]  The Bible also tells us of another way to hell.
[131]  This way to hell is very clean; it is not as filthy as the previous ways.
[132]  This way is to refuse the gospel of the Lord Jesus.
[133]  "Rendering vengeance to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[134]  Those who do not obey the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ will go to hell!
[135]  God tells us through the apostle that "the gospel...I delivered to you, first of all, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures" 1 Cor 15:3-4 .
[136]  Last time I spoke on five ways of going to hell.
[137]  The first was suicide, the second was refusing to remove sin, the third was pride, the fourth was adultery, and the fifth was disobeying the gospel.
[138]  But concerning the way that leads to destruction, I advise you to be careful and not to run on it, or you will end up in the place of eternal perdition.
[139]  However, if you wish to go to hell but do not know the way, perhaps I can clearly present a road map to hell before you so that you may follow it and go to your destination.
[140]  Even if you intend to go to hell, even if you have decided to perish forever, I still hope that the Holy Spirit will use the word that I am going to say today to make you feel alarmed and unwilling to be a man of destruction, and make you fear the punishment of hell and be willing to turn back and no longer walk on the dangerous way that leads to destruction.
[141]  If it were my word, then on the day of judgment, when you if there are covetous men here meet me, you certainly can say to me, "Mr. Preacher, you said that I would go to hell, but now I am here in heaven." Can covetous men go to heaven? You may say that covetous men can go to heaven, but do you all believe it? The Word of God says that those who covet riches will go to hell.
[142]  On November 21, 1916, there were two students in a girls' school in Peking.
[143]  The last name of one was Yang and the other's was Liao.
[144]  Let us read a passage from the Bible that was spoken by the Lord Jesus Christ.
[145]  For you build up the graves of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the righteous, and say, If we had been there in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
[146]  Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues and persecute from city to city, so that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth" Matt 23:29-35 .
[147]  But if you persecute or kill them because they believe in the Lord Jesus, and their conduct is not below the normal moral standard, then beware, because their God is the Lord of all who will punish sinners.
[148]  If you are a thoughtful person and know that you have sinned, you should quickly repent and believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior.
[149]  The Bible mentions the word "blood" more than four hundred times.
[150]  Since God mentions the blood so often, we know that the blood is very important.
[151]  We have seen many ways to go to hell.
[152]  All of these ways are easy because it is easy to go to hell.
[153]  You heard that sinners will be punished and will go to hell, but you say, "Whether I go to hell or not, whether I am punished or not, I don't care.
[154]  While you think that you will not necessarily go to hell, you do not have the assurance that you are going to heaven.
[155]  I will speak of a final way to go to hell.
[156]  Many of us have already perceived the reality of the coming age and realize that we should believe in the Lord Jesus to avoid God's punishment and wrath.
[157]  We have known that we should have our sins purged, forsake the companions of fornication, believe in the death of the Lord Jesus for us, and confess Him as our Savior.
[158]  However, you dare not believe or confess because you are afraid that other people might scorn you or rise up against you.
[159]  Whenever you think about this, Satan will say to you, "Consider this: if you tell them that you have believed in Christ, they will probably give you the same treatment as they have given to the other Christians.
[160]  Satan might say to you, "If you have decided to believe in the Lord Jesus as your Savior, I have no way to stop you.
[161]  However, why do you have to confess the Lord Jesus as your Savior before men?
[162]  If you do this, you can believe in the Lord Jesus and no one will mock you.
[163]  If you truly love your household, you should be the pioneer in believing in the Lord Jesus so that they might also have the opportunity to believe in Christ.
[164]  I have previously mentioned ten ways to go to hell.
[165]  Now we want to examine in the Bible five more ways to go to hell.
[166]  If there is no hell, there is no God because if God does not punish the world, then He is not God.
[167]  The present world can be said to be a lying world.
[168]  There are two kinds of excuses, one unintentional and the other intentional.
[169]  If you know that it is important to believe in the Lord Jesus and be saved, then your excuses are intentional if you reject these words through your unwilling heart, fear of men, or dislike of men's mocking.
[170]  If you do not have any prejudice, you will see that your excuses are without reason and that you do not have any problem.
[171]  If God has helped you and enabled you to believe and if it is God who has begun in you this good work, He will surely complete it.
[172]  If you say this, let me advise you: if you do not choose to believe in the Lord Jesus, I have nothing more to say, but if you choose to believe in Him, do not be the kind of Christian mentioned above; otherwise, you will stumble others!
[173]  Suppose you make an excuse now and do not accept Christ as your Savior; you may not have any regrets even while you are alive, and you may not have any regrets when you are about to die, but you will have regrets after you die and enter eternity.
[174]  We have to be careful not to think that only people outside the church will go to hell.
[175]  They have not genuinely believed in the substitutional death of the Lord Jesus; they are not yet saved and do not have eternal life.
[176]  But if you do not trust in the Lord Jesus as your Savior and are not saved according to God's will, whatever you do and whatever denomination you belong to cannot grant you the possibility of salvation.
[177]  John 3:18 says, "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God."
[178]  Verse 36 says, "He who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him."
[179]  Not seeing life and having the wrath of God abide on one is also to perish and suffer God's punishment, which is also to go to hell.
[180]  It does not matter whether you are a moralist, religionist, or philosopher; it does not matter how much good you have done, how virtuous, righteous, loving, and kind you are.
[181]  If you do not believe in the Son of God, the death and judgment waiting for you will be no different from that of the publicans and sinners.
[182]  But as long as you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, that is good enough for you to perish and go to hell.
[183]  The Holy Spirit is now working among us and causing us to realize that we must believe in the Lord Jesus before we can be saved.
[184]  They realize that it is good to believe in the Lord Jesus and they know they will be saved by believing in the Lord Jesus.
[185]  Are you willing to say that no matter what circumstances befall you and what opportunities you have during this year that you will not accept Christ, and that you must wait for another year before you will accept Him?"
[186]  Are you willing to say that you will not believe in Christ within this month no matter what opportunity is afforded to you and that you will wait until next month to believe?
[187]  If you cannot say it, why do you wait when you know that you should believe in Christ as your Savior and that by believing you will be saved from hell?
[188]  Dear ones, if you know that your life is precious, if you know that your soul is important, and if you know that Christ will save sinners, why do you still wait?
[189]  SPIRITUAL TEACHINGS MESSAGE ONE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION Talks to Young Christians Issue No. 1
[190]  Every time I go to a place to preach God's gospel of grace, I always ask the local Christians one question.
[191]  I believe all those who can answer me with a clear "yes" are joyfully enjoying the grace of God.
[192]  In other words, do you really know that you are saved?
[193]  Then I ask these ones, "You have received the Lord Jesus and have accepted Him as your personal Savior.
[194]  If you accept the Lord Jesus as the sin offering, you do not have to hope to be saved because you have eternal life already.
[195]  We only hope for things that we have not yet obtained.
[196]  If we have them already, we do not need to hope for them anymore.
[197]  When a child's father leaves his home, the child hopes very much to see the father.
[198]  If the mother asks the child, "Do you still hope to see your father?", the child will answer, "I have seen my father already.
[199]  Either the world believes in Jesus and is saved and has eternal life, or it is not saved and is perishing.
[200]  If you have indeed believed in Jesus Christ as your Savior and have believed in His death on the cross where He bore your sins for you, you are saved already.
[201]  He has given the Lord Jesus to the world, to die for the world and accomplish salvation on the cross, so that everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus would have eternal life and not perish.
[202]  Perhaps when you read up to this point, you will think like many other believers, "Would it not be too proud of me to say that I am already saved?
[203]  I am not better in any way in my conduct than others.
[204]  Dear readers, for us to know that we are saved is not to be proud.
[205]  To say that we do not need to be saved or that we have no need of salvation is indeed proud; it is indeed to consider ourselves better than others.
[206]  But to say that we are saved indicates that we were sinners and were to perish, but that we are now saved by Him through trusting in Him.
[207]  The Bible does not say: "I give these happy feelings to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God."
[208]  The Bible only makes a distinction between "believing" and "not believing."
[209]  The Bible does not know what an incomplete faith means.
[210]  God does not save us because we have attained the merit of believing.
[211]  Every time we consider the cross, it invokes wonder in us!
[212]  Every time we remember the redemption of the Lord Jesus, our hearts are filled both with sorrow and with joy.
[213]  To us the Lord's cross is not just a wooden cross, but a symbol of His full redemptive work and of the full salvation accomplished through this redemptive work.
[214]  When I first received the Lord, I often wondered how the men in the Old Testament, who came before the time of the Lord's crucifixion, could be saved.
[215]  If the blood of bulls and goats was not able to remove sin, as we mentioned earlier, how then were those in the Old Testament saved?
[216]  We shall, therefore, pay attention only to those in the present time.
[217]  Hebrews 10:19 and 20 say, "Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way through the veil, that is, His flesh."
[218]  God Himself knows the eternal worth of His Son's cross.
[219]  He has manifested to all the eternal freshness of the cross of His Son.
[220]  If we truly see the Lord's cross all the time, if we truly see how He suffered there, if we see the wounds on His hands and feet and the crown of thorns on His head, if we see how His love and blood mingled, and if we see His sufferings and sorrow, will we not be deeply moved, and will we not cease from doing things that do not please Him or cause Him sorrow?
[221]  A great number of people who have believed in the Lord Jesus as their Savior have discovered a new experience soon after they have believed: in their hearts it seems that there are two natures.
[222]  Before we speak of our present condition, we should first understand the kind of person we were before we believed in the Lord.
[223]  After that, we will speak of our condition after we believed in the Lord.
[224]  We know that we are persons made up of three parts the spirit, the soul, and the body.
[225]  The spirit is the organ with which we fellowship with God.
[226]  He sentenced the Lord Jesus to death because He intended, on the one hand, that the Lord become sin for us, and on the other hand, that the old Adamic creation be crucified with Him, so that He could give us a new life.
[227]  The Bible clearly describes this conflict between the new nature and the old.
[228]  In Romans 7, Paul vividly portrayed this kind of life of conflict through his own experience.
[229]  He said, "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do" v. 15 . This is the conflict of the new and the old natures.
[230]  For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice...I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.
[231]  These three verses tell us two ways to overcome the flesh, that is, the sinful nature, the old nature, and the old Adamic nature.
[232]  Actually, the two ways are merely two aspects, or two phases, of one way.
[233]  The cross and the Holy Spirit are the unique way to overcome the sinful nature.
[234]  When the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, not only did He die for us, but He crucified our flesh with Him on the cross.
[235]  While you are reading, you can exercise your faith to reckon yourself dead to sin, and you can pray that the Holy Spirit of the Lord will apply the cross of the Lord Jesus deeply in you, so that you can overcome sin in your experience.
[236]  The following article which appeared in Issue No. 7 of The Christian "Spiritual Teachings" is an excerpt from "The Messenger of the Cross" in Volume Two, Chapter Two of The Collected Works of Watchman Nee.
[237]  At the present time, we should pay attention to the word which we preach.
[238]  We do not have to mention those who preach the wrong gospel.
[239]  What we preach is the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus Christ and how it saves sinners from the condemnation of sin and the power of sin.
[240]  We know that the Lord Jesus died for sinners on the cross so that all who believe in Him can be saved apart from any work.
[241]  The message Paul preached was the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[242]  The message he preached was not in vain because he was a living channel of life.
[243]  He begot many people through the gospel of the cross.
[244]  Those who are not crucified cannot be and are not worthy to preach the message of the cross.
[245]  The cross which we preach should crucify us first.
[246]  The message we preach should burn in our life first so that our life and our message can be mingled together.
[247]  When we partake of the cross of the Lord Jesus by faith, it is like eating His flesh and drinking His blood.
[248]  If we do not have the experience of crucifixion in our life, if we do not have the experience of dying together with the Lord in overcoming sin and self, if we do not have the experience of bearing the cross and following the Lord to suffer for Him, and if we only know the word of the cross from others' speaking and writings but have no experience of it ourselves, we surely cannot give life to others.
[249]  Therefore, if you do not let the Holy Spirit pour out His life through your life to others' spirits, others will not have the life of the Holy Spirit and will not have the power to practice what you preach.
[250]  If a saint does not cooperate with God by persisting in his opposition to Satan, if he does not ask the Lord for light to discern the real condition of the situation, or if he will not submit to God's words, then God cannot keep him.
[251]  If we are humble and not self-assuming or stubborn, if we admit that we can easily be deceived, if we single-heartedly seek the Lord so that He would reveal the real condition and true significance behind every matter, and if we wholeheartedly resist the works and wiles of the enemy, we will know if our spiritual experience is from God or from Satan.
[252]  If God has not revealed the real condition behind a particular matter to us in our spirit and we have not actually tested whether it is from God, we must not assume that it has been given by God.
[253]  It is very easy for the heart to become cold; it is also extremely difficult for the head to remain calm.
[254]  In the twinkling of an eye, when we are just slightly unwatchful, our loving heart toward God and man spontaneously cools down.
[255]  What you have not experienced cannot be called experience.
[256]  If scriptural teachings and doctrines are not experienced personally by us, they have nothing to do with us.
[257]  Although they do not have a strong faith in the Lord that would cause them to pray unceasingly to Him and receive numerous miraculous and wonderful answers to their prayers from God, they wholeheartedly praise and admire this kind of spiritual experience.
[258]  MESSAGE EIGHT HOW TO BE WITHOUT WANT Issue Nos.
[259]  In these days we see many believers who are in poverty.
[260]  There are many other passages in the Bible which speak of the principle of "give, and it will be given to you."
[261]  One verse that many Christians treasure very much is Philippians 4:19.
[262]  Paul said, "And my God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus."
[263]  This source is not in the saints but in God.
[264]  It comes spontaneously and without reluctance because we put our trust only in those that we consider trustworthy.
[265]  We do not need greater faith, we need to know the faithfulness and trustworthiness of God.
[266]  If we realized that God was the source of our faith, we would no longer seek faith in ourselves.
[267]  Instead, we would lift up our eyes to God and seek to know Him.
[268]  If we know that God is reliable, we will trust Him.
[269]  We should not ask or search to see if we have faith, and we should not trust in God only when we have faith.
[270]  Likewise, if we say, "I cannot commit these things to God because I have no faith," it does not mean that we do not believe in God.
[271]  All of these promises are real and can be enjoyed by every saint.
[272]  In the stories in the Bible, we see how God worked for His children and stretched forth His mighty arm to save, protect, and guide.
[273]  We often hear God's children say that such and such a teaching in the Bible is essential, and such and such a teaching is nonessential.
[274]  God has said that those who believe in the Lord Jesus have eternal life; therefore, since they have believed and received eternal life, believers think that there is no further need to be concerned with God's other commandments and will.
[275]  In the same way, faith without works is dead.
[276]  When we believe in God, spontaneously we will not worry and strive.
[277]  We will not do these things; this is the negative works of faith.
[278]  The negative works of faith are important and necessary, but they are not complete.
[279]  Now, through the power of God, there are things that we should do.
[280]  The conscience is God's voice of righteousness within man.
[281]  It is a part of the spirit, and its function is to rebuke everything that is not of God and against righteousness.
[282]  MESSAGE FOURTEEN THE CONDESCENSION OF THE LORD JESUS Issue No. 24
[283]  Only the One who is the highest can condescend to be the lowest.
[284]  The whole life of our Lord shows us that He condescended in this way.
[285]  When we read the four Gospels, we see a condescending life unfold before us.
