Chapter six removes the sinner; it does not remove the sin. Chapter seven removes the flesh; it does not remove the law. Through the cross of Christ, our old man is removed and sin is made of none effect. Through the flesh of Christ, our flesh is gone and the law is made of none effect.</p><p>Chapters five through eight show on the one hand that we are in Christ and on the other hand that we are in Adam. They show on the one hand that we are in the Spirit and on the other hand that we are in the flesh. Romans 5:12-21 speaks of our being in Adam; this is an objective fact before salvation. Romans 6:1-11 speaks of our being in Christ; this is an objective spiritual fact after salvation. Chapter seven speaks of our subjective experience in the flesh. A man can understand the spiritual fact in Romans 6:1-11, but he will fail if he exercises the fleshly power in chapter seven. In chapter eight we find that the true power is the Holy Spirit.</p><p>In chapter seven we have the flesh and the law, but in chapter eight we only have the Holy Spirit. In chapter seven the law reveals God's will, but the flesh tries to do His will. In chapter eight the Holy Spirit is doing God's will. Now the Holy Spirit Himself has become a law. There are two great problems in chapter seven: (1) The law is not perfect, and (2) man is wrong in himself. In chapter seven we find two laws: the law of sin and the law of death. In chapter eight we find only one law: the law of the Spirit of life. Sin refers to what one does actively, whereas death refers to what one fails to do passively. On the active side, the law of sin relates to sin, whereas on the negative side, the law of death relates to God. Sin is our committing of transgressions, whereas death is our extreme weakness to do anything. The law of sin operates in us and causes us to sin, whereas the law of death operates in us and makes us powerless. The man in chapter seven first discovers the law of death and then the law of sin.</p><p>Doctrinally speaking, we have the law of sin and of death, but experientially speaking, we have sin and the mortal body. Man's sin has to do with his body. The body of sin in Romans 6:6 means that the body is under sin. Chapter six also speaks of the body of sin being unemployed. The sin in Romans 7:5 and 23 dwells in the body. This means that the law of sin dwells in the members. Romans 8:9-10 says that Christ dwells in us through the Holy Spirit. What is the result of these two indwellings? These indwellings occur within us at the same time, yet there is a difference between the work of the two indwellings. Chapter eight speaks of Christ saving our spirit before our body. Chapter seven shows a man who is indwelt by Christ, resulting in his inner man desiring God's will. At the same time, we see the evil in the mortal body. The righteousness referred to in Romans 1:1&mdash;5:11 is an "imputed" righteousness, whereas the righteousness after 5:12 is a "dispensed" righteousness. Romans 8:11 speaks of the Holy Spirit dwelling within us and giving life to our mortal bodies. According to a Chinese maxim, when one draws a dragon, he does not draw the eyes. Because the drawings are so life-like, there is the thought that once the eyes are "dotted in," the dragon will fly away. When the Holy Spirit is "dotted in" in us, the body flies away, and this same body becomes one with the Spirit. We have to wait for the full redemption of the body before we can allow Christ to live in us in full. However, even though the body is not yet redeemed, it no longer has to be a frustration to God's will.</p><p>Chapter six speaks of the body of death. Chapter seven says that a believer should not try to do good any longer, because he has a body of death. If we want to accomplish anything, we have to look to Christ. We have to believe that He is working, and we have to look to His working and believe that He has accomplished what He wanted to accomplish.</p><p>Chapter eight begins with "no condemnation" and ends with glorification; this is the subject of chapter eight. God will not be satisfied until He saves us all the way into glory. The result of man's fall is that he comes short of the glory of God, whereas the Lord has come to bring many sons into glory.</p><p>A man who lives in the flesh is a man who lives by the power of the flesh. With such a one, there are only natural power and the flesh. Chapter seven shows how weak a man in the flesh is. His weakness is proven by the fact that he cannot keep the law. Once God puts man into the Holy Spirit, he overcomes. Being in Christ is objective, whereas being in the Holy Spirit is subjective; the Holy Spirit dispenses all of Christ's accomplishments upon us and into us. Christ is our life, but the Holy Spirit makes us alive. What is the gospel? When the Holy Spirit descends, we have the gospel. The Father designed the plan of salvation; this gives us the hope of salvation. The Son accomplished salvation; this gives us the basis of salvation. The Holy Spirit wrought this salvation into us; this gives us the fact of salvation. The Holy Spirit can only carry out His work according to Christ; He cannot do what Christ has not accomplished. The work of the Spirit is fellowship; therefore, He transmits what the Son has done to us. Everything that is in Christ becomes living when it is in the Holy Spirit. Since both Christ and the Spirit have come, why are believers still lacking in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit? The reason is that they have not experienced Romans 7 adequately. Our position is in Christ, but we are not aware of the corruption of the flesh. Therefore, we still live in Adam. The activities of the flesh put a man in the flesh and cause him to be no longer in the Spirit. Only after a man has become utterly disappointed with the flesh will he be in the Spirit. Whenever God's truth is separated from the Holy Spirit, it becomes the law. Whenever Christ's work is separated from the Holy Spirit, it becomes useless within man. A spiritual matter is living only when it is put into the Holy Spirit. Apart from the Holy Spirit, everything is dead (cf. John 15:5). In this world, only those who have lost hope in themselves will know the work of the Spirit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_088.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_090.html">Next</a> </body></html>
