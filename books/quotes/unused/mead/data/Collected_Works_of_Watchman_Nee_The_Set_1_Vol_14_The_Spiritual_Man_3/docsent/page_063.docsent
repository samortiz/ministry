   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MUCH BETTER TO BE HEALED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There are also some believers who have gone to another extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to their natural disposition, they are hard and stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, through God's allowed sickness, they have become broken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a result of going along with God's will through His chastisement, they have become very gentle, kind, yielding, and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Accordingly, they consider that being sick is a great benefit for them, and they begin to love sickness more than health.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that sicknesses cause their spiritual life to advance greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, they do not seek healing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they realize that they should be healed, they would rather have God heal them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They accept all the sicknesses that come upon their bodies, thinking that it is easier for them to be godly when they are sick than when they are healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They think they are closer to God when they are lonely and in pain than when they are well and active.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They think it is far better to lie in bed than to be free to run around.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They do not want to ask for healing from God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They think that it may be more profitable to be weak than to be strong!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We admit that many believers have given up their evil works by becoming sick, and that they have acquired some profound experiences through their sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We also admit that many handicapped and disabled persons have exceptionally godly and spiritual experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we must say that many believers are quite unclear concerning several points in this area.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although one who is sick can be holy, such holiness is compelled.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps if he were healthy and could choose freely, he would want to turn back to the world and his natural self.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He becomes holy only when he is sick, and he becomes worldly when he is not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord has to keep him in sickness continuously before he can be holy continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His holiness is dependent on his sickness!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A living that is for the Lord should not be restricted to times of sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not let others think that the only way God can subdue a believer is by sickness, and that without sickness, he is incapable of glorifying God in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A believer should express God's life in his daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>While it is good to endure suffering, it is better to obey God at a time when one is full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should know that healing is of God; it is God who heals us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we seek after healing through man's medicine, we will find ourselves separated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if we seek after God's healing, we will become more intimate with God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A person who receives God's healing will glorify God more than one who remains in sickness for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is true that sickness can glorify God because sickness provides God an opportunity to manifest His healing power John 9:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if one remains sick all the time, how can God be glorified?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When one receives God's healing, he sees God's glory through the demonstration of His power.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord Jesus never considered sickness as a blessing, as something which believers should bear until they die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Neither did He say that sickness is an expression of love from God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus desired His disciples to bear the cross, but He never said that the sick should remain in sickness all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He told the disciples the manner in which they should suffer for Him, but He never said that they should suffer sickness for His sake.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although He said we would have suffering in the world, He did not consider sickness a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He indeed suffered while He was on the earth, but He was not sick.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Moreover, every time He saw sick ones, He healed them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He always considered sickness to be from sin and the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must differentiate between suffering and sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"Many are the misfortunes of the righteous man,/But Jehovah delivers him from all of them./He keeps all his bones;/Not one of them is broken" Psa 34:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>James said, "Does anyone among you suffer evil?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let him pray" James 5:13 , so that he may obtain grace and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"Is anyone among you ill?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him" v. 14 , so that he may be healed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>First Corinthians 11:30 through 32 clearly depicts the relationship between sickness and the believer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sickness ultimately is a discipline from God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a believer will judge himself, God will cause the sickness to disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God never intends for believers to suffer sickness continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If a believer removes what God condemns and, at the same time, permits sickness to stay in his body, he does not know God's purpose in allowing him to be sick.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No discipline should last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Once the cause of discipline is removed, the discipline itself should quickly disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Now no discipline at the present time seems to be a matter of joy, but of grief; but afterward..."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Heb 12:11a .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Believers almost forget that with God there is still an "afterward."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been exercised by it" v. 11b . Discipline is not meant to last forever.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In fact, the most excellent fruit comes after the discipline is over.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Neither should we be misled to think that God's discipline is His punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Strictly speaking, believers will no longer be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First Corinthians 11:31 makes this quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should never allow the concept of law to come in. It is not a matter of how many sins we have committed; we do not have to suffer a certain amount of punishment before our sins can be balanced out.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is not an affair to be settled in court but a problem to be dealt with in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we turn back to the direct teaching of the Bible, we will see what God ultimately wants of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to read only one verse, and the concepts of many will be completely overthrown.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Beloved, concerning all things I wish that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers" 3 John 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a prayer which the Holy Spirit reveals to the apostle, and it shows God's intention towards the believer's body and His desire in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God has no intention for His children to remain sick all their lives and unable to actively work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He delights to see His children prosper and healthy, even as their soul prospers.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This allows us to conclude unquestionably that prolonged sickness is not God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He may temporarily discipline us and cause us to lose our health, but He is not pleased to see us constantly in weakness.</S>
