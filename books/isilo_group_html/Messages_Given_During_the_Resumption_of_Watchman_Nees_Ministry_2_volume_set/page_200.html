Knowing How to Live in Abundance&#151;<br>Taking Only What One Needs</H2><P>Brother Chang Kwang-yung asked again: Sometimes after I deliver a message, I feel hungry, and good food is placed before me. If I eat too much, it would be embarrassing. What should I do? After working in a place, and when I am about to leave, others would try to give me gifts. What should I do? If I do not accept them, the host would be offended. But if I accept them, should I give something in return later?</P><P>Brother Nee answered: We have to know how to live in abundance. However, to live in abundance does not mean to enjoy abundance. I know when to eat and when not to eat. A person who is careless in eating is one who has never been restricted before God. If I really need a chicken, I can eat a chicken every day. If I do not need it, even if five chickens are served in front of me, I can refuse them. In principle, I eat only the portion served to me.</P><P>When Satan sinned, he craved for the throne. When man sinned, he craved for food. It is not a question of eating much or eating little, but a question of eating what is placed in front of you. I will not make additional requests on top of what others are serving me. When I live among others, I maintain my standing. Otherwise, you will give others a bad impression about the gospel. When many young workers are about to be sent out for some work, I would invite them to a good meal. That one meal determines whether or not a worker will go out. Perhaps this is not a good thing to say, because the next time it will not be an easy thing for me to invite anyone for meals anymore.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Concerning Receiving Gifts</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Accepting in Love, Sharing with Others</H2><P>Concerning the matter of receiving gifts, I can tell you a story. In 1937 I was in Manila. At the end of my stay, the brothers and sisters there sent me away on a ship with a crate of fruit. Inside the crate was one hundred eighty to two hundred pieces of fruit. If I spread out the fruit in my cabin, I could almost start a fruit store. But by the time I left the ship and went on shore, I did not have one piece of fruit left; I had given them all away to the attendants. Although they were not poor with regard to money, they were poor with regard to fruit. If I went home with two hundred pieces of fruit, what would others think? They would say what a scene that a preacher would come back with so much fruit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. No Need to Give Others Gifts in Return</H2><P>If others give us gifts, we cannot give gifts to them in return. If we do, this kind of thing will never end. We cannot turn down the brothers' and sisters' love. But I would rather share with the poor people such love. If others invite me for a meal, I would rather eat five bowlfuls, and send the other five bowlfuls to the poor people outside the door.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TESTIMONY AND EXHORTATIONS</H2><P>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling from Tientsin testified: The church in Tientsin began in 1936. By the grace of the Lord, we have been in one accord for the last twelve years. As long as there are two or three who are faithful, the testimony can be maintained. Four major events happened during these years. The first was the political turmoil. The second was the flood. The third was the war in Asia, and the fourth was the so-called North China Christian Alliance. At present we have about one hundred people breaking bread. Among them, two or three brothers are particularly living and fresh. The responsible brothers are Hsia Hsi-ling and Lee Pi. At present we use the meeting hall for prayer, and the place is too small.</P><P>Brother Nee's word of exhortation: We hope that Brother Hsia can leave his job and be free from the bondage of money. Money should only help us in the gospel; it should not hinder the gospel. In assigning the co-workers, we should take the most economical way. We must see that God is moving already, before we should move.</P><P>The work in Tsingtao should face west along the railway line. The work in Shanghai should face the direction of the Yangtse River. The work in Tientsin should face the east as well as the west. What we have at present should be strengthened. If some brothers feel clear to go, we should release them to go.</P><P>Brother Mak from Swatow testified: I began to learn to come into the service in 1940. I stayed in Sian for six years. At present I am in Swatow. There are about three hundred saints who are in fellowship with us. We are short of brothers who can give messages.</P><P>Brother Nee's exhortation: The Gospels mention the story of the woman with an issue of blood. There were many people at that time. The object of their touching was the same, yet the result of their touching was not the same. Everyone was touching Christ, but the woman's touching was different from the others' touching. Others may have touched His back or His arms. They may even have torn His garment, but there was no result. The same kind of people may be praying in tears; the same kind of people may be touching the Lord. Everything may be the same, but the result is not the same. We have to see that there is another world behind the visible things. If we are not careful, we will become the crowd who were pressing against the Lord. There were many who were following the Lord and many who were touching Him. But only one person's touch made a change in life. Outwardly, everyone was touching Him, but if one were to dig deeper, he would discover that there was another world. This one touched a Christ that no one else had touched. Even though others pressed against Him, the Lord ignored them all. Others' touching did not bring about anything, but this woman's touch brought about something.</P><P>Today, those Christians who are pressing the Lord will not be saved. Only those who are touching Him in a real way will be saved. Whether or not you have someone to give messages is not the main thing. Today, many people who give messages are merely causing people to press against the Lord. What we need are those who are willing to pay a serious price.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_199.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_201.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 200</div><br></body></html>
