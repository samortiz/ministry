   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fornication, Idolatry, and Demonic Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Next, the sevenfold intensified Spirit saves the believers from the fornication, idolatry, demonic teaching, and satanic depths in Catholicism, signified by the church in Thyatira vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>18-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the Catholic Church today, there are many demonic teachings, for example, the teaching that one s prayers can shorten the time that someone else will spend in purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though the Catholic Church correctly teaches certain things regarding God, Christ, and redemption, this teaching has been leavened by being mixed with pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many of these are enumerated in the book entitled The Two Babylons.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>e. Spiritual Death</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, the believers need to be saved from the spiritual death from being dead and dying in Protestantism, signified by the church in Sardis 3:1-6 .</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Next, the believers need to be saved from the losing of the crown, which has been gained already in Brethrenism, signified by the church in Philadelphia vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>7-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Philadelphia means brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some in Brethrenism had gained the crown but eventually were defeated and were in danger of losing the crown at the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, the Lord warned them, saying, Hold fast what you have that no one take your crown v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>g. Lukewarmness and Christlessness</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Finally, Christ as the sevenfold intensified Spirit saves the believers from the lukewarmness and the Christlessness in degraded Brethrenism, signified by the church in Laodicea vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>14-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We know that the church in Laodicea was Christless by the fact that He was outside the church, standing at the door and knocking v. 20 . This indicates that we may have Christ in name but not in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to be careful lest this become our situation today.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now we need to see the means by which the believers are saved from the degradation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>a. The Speaking of the Pneumatic Christ</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ saves us from degradation by His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Revelation 2 and 3 the speaking of the unlimited life-releasing sevenfold intensified pneumatic Christ to the seven churches at the beginning of each epistle respectively becomes the speaking of the sevenfold intensified, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit to all the seven churches at the end of each epistle universally 2:1, 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, 18, 29; 3:1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the beginning of each of the seven epistles, it is Christ who is speaking, but at the end of each epistle it is the Spirit who is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The speaking of Christ therefore becomes the speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From this we see that Christ s speaking and the Spirit s speaking are one speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Christ speaks to a particular local church, and the Spirit speaks to the universal Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By this speaking Christ saves us from the degradation of today s church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>b.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ and the Spirit speak, and the overcoming saints respond and say yes to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The believers who respond in this way will be saved.</S>
