The Christians in this group are concerned with the spread of the gospel. They are content to labor together for the spread of the gospel, but they do not stress the truth. The evangelicals can be subdivided into three groups, the largest group being the missions. The most influential mission has been China Inland Mission, which focuses on preaching the gospel in foreign countries. After the political situation changed in China, however, China Inland Mission ceased its work in China and is no longer as influential. It is a top mission that was highly esteemed in the hearts of Christians during the past fifty to sixty years. Another mission is the Oriental Missionary Society founded by Charles E. Cowman, whose wife wrote Streams in the Desert. Other mission groups are the Christian and Missionary Alliance, which was founded by Dr. A. B. Simpson, and the Baptist denomination. These are very good missions that send missionaries to preach the gospel overseas. They are admired and respected by Christians in the West.
