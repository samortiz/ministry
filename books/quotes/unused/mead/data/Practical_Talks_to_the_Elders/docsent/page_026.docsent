   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX AVOIDING FAMILY ENTANGLEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament does not give us a clear record of the families of the apostles or of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From Paul s words in 1 Corinthians 9:5, and also from Matthew 8:14, Mark 1:30, and Luke 4:38, we know that Peter had a wife; these are the only words in the New Testament concerning the families of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul, however, speaks several times of his spiritual children.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He referred to Timothy as his spiritual child 1 Tim 1:2, 18 , and also Titus Titus 1:4 and Onesimus Philem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>10 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter also calls Mark his son 1 Pet 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There must be a reason for this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have considered this matter for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My conclusion, which I am going to tell you, is an understanding from my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have never read anything concerning this matter, and I have been unable to find a biblical interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The only way I have to understand this matter is by experience and observation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FAMILY INVOLVEMENT AN ENTANGLEMENT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to human affections, it s really hard for anyone not to have his family involved in his career.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have a business or some kind of enterprise, it is easy for your family to get involved in it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nonetheless, in spiritual things family involvement is always an entanglement.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The relationship among the apostles and among the elders and even among the churches should be absolutely and purely in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do believe this is the basic reason that in the early days of the church and the work, the elders and particularly the apostles didn t bring in their families.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the family is brought into the church leadership, or into the work, there is a peril that the thing would not be so pure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have seen a few places praise the Lord, not many where the co-workers brought their family into the relationship with other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In some places also I have seen where the elders brought their families into relationships with others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, with not one exception, wherever there was such an involvement, there was suffering and loss.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Let me give you a real illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There was a church in which an elder had contacts with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These contacts led to a relationship between his family and theirs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A number of these brothers with their wives were willing to help this elder in church affairs, but not in a pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Eventually, this elder s home became a center for this kind of relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They termed it fellowship, but actually they went far beyond the limits of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some wives don t like to have others come into their home frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They like to keep their home free of so many contacts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This doesn t mean that they don t love the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They love them, yet they like to keep a distance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, there are also some sisters not too many who like to have people coming into their home.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They like their family to be like a market, with the more people the better.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I have seen this happen.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In every place where relationships among families have been too close, the church in that place has suffered a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually that family actually rules, controls, the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Actually, it was not the family; it was the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That wife controlled the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This has happened in some places.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The scale was quite large in some places.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The larger the scale of such a practice, the more the church eventually suffers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The point is this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the eldership we must bear the responsibility in a very pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There must be purity in the motive, in the intention, in the procedures, and in all the doings related to the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is always good to draw a clear line between the leadership and your family.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because you are one of those taking the lead, things will come to your attention at home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then your wife or children can easily get involved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For the long run, it is always profitable to draw a clear line.</S>
