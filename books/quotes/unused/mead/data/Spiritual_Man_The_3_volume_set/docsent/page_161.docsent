   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Since this is our situation even in the initial step of knowing the will of God, it is no wonder that we do not have any deeper revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this condition, we will never be in our spirit which enables us to know God's plan for this last age, the reality of spiritual warfare, or the deep and profound truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Furthermore, in the matter of worshipping God, we will follow either what we deem to be right, or we will follow the transient outbursts of our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these circumstances, fellowship with the Lord in our intuition becomes nonexistent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A believer must know that only the Holy Spirit knows the things of God, and that He knows the things of God through the intuition, not through the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, only He can impart this knowledge to men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, the one who receives this knowledge must receive it in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that he also must use his intuition to know what the Holy Spirit knows through His intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The union of these two intuitions will result in man knowing the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 13 says, "Which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual things with spiritual words."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now we come to the way to speak to others about what we know by our intuition in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The things pertaining to God are already known in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our responsibility is to preach these things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The apostle said that he would not use "words taught by human wisdom" to speak about the things he knew in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's wisdom belongs to man's mind; it is the product of man's brain.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The apostle said that he would not use words conjured up in his mind to speak about the things of God that he knew in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The apostle Paul's wisdom was very great.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He was well able to come up with novel expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He knew how to speak, what illustrations he should use, and how to structure his speech.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He could use his natural eloquence very well to make his listeners fully understand his meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, he said that he would not use words taught by man's wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means that not only is man's mind useless in knowing the things of God, it is also useless in speaking about spiritual wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He spoke in words "taught by the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This refers to the instruction of the Holy Spirit which he received in his intuition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nothing is of any value in the Christian life except being in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even when we speak about spiritual knowledge, we must use spiritual utterances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only does the intuition know the things revealed to us by the Holy Spirit, it also knows the words that the Holy Spirit has instructed us to use to utter what He has revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many times a believer receives God's revelation, becomes clear about a certain matter, and wants to preach this to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For him, this matter is very clear, and he understands it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, his preaching cannot convey his thought fully because he has not received the words in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes when a believer is waiting before the Lord, something seems to rise up in his innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may be just a few words, but those few words when spoken in a meeting fully convey God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Through this experience, he realizes that God has truly used him to testify for Him.</S>
