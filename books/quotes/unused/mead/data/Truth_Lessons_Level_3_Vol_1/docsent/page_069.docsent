   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The children of Israel went out of Egypt, journeyed a long distance in the wilderness, and, by God s provisions in different ways, eventually arrived at the mount of God Exo 18:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On this mountain God first decreed the law, which was instituted according to what He is, as His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then He charged the children of Israel to make a tabernacle for Him according to the pattern He showed them on the mount Exo 25:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through this tabernacle they could sacrifice to God; that is, they could worship and serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. THE LAW OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before God told the children of Israel to make a tabernacle and an altar for Him, He first declared to them His law Exo 20:1-21 as a preparation for them to make a tabernacle and an altar for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Without being exposed and enlightened by the law, man could not sense the need for the tabernacle and the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. Being a Portrait of What God Is</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Apparently, the law of God given in Exodus 20 consists merely of some commandments that God wanted man to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, it is a portrait, a description, of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is love and light; God is also holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God enacted His law according to what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because He is a God of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, He enacted the law that is of love, light, holiness, and righteousness to correspond with His attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, the law enacted by God is God s portrait, description, and testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. Exposing the True Condition of Man</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>So That Man Would Be Afraid</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>to Draw Near to God</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The law of God has a negative function and that is to expose man s true condition so that man is afraid to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since the law of God is of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, it exposes the sinner s true condition, which is contrary to God s attributes, so that man is afraid to draw near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the sinner is aware of his sins and conscious of his need for Christ and His redemption, typified by the tabernacle and the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE TABERNACLE</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On Mount Sinai not only did God s people receive the law, which revealed what God is and exposed their true condition, but they also received the vision of God s dwelling place the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This tells us that the desire of God s heart is to have a dwelling place on earth with His redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the goal of God in saving us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. Typifying Christ</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The tabernacle which God charged Moses to build is a type of the incarnated Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 1:14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The incarnated Word, Christ, is the tabernacle which God pitched on earth among men.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As God s Concrete Expression in Humanity</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Colossians 2:9 says, For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>From the time that Christ became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead began to dwell in a concrete way in Him as the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, 1 Timothy 3:16 says, Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the flesh means in the likeness, in the fashion, of man Rom 8:3; Phil 2:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ appeared to people in the form of man 2 Cor 5:16 , yet He was God manifested in man He was the embodiment of God in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is a God-man, having two natures, the divine nature and the human nature, with the divine nature existing in the human nature and being expressed through the human nature.</S>
