   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-EIGHT THE CHURCH THE STAGES OF THE CHURCH 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall cover the last two stages of the church signified by the church in Philadelphia Rev 3:7-13 and the church in Laodicea 3:14-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>G. The Church in Philadelphia Prefigures the Church of Brotherly Love, the Recovery of the Proper Church Life, from the Early Part of the Nineteenth Century to the Second Appearing of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Greek, "Philadelphia" means brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers who were raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Just as the reformed church, prefigured by the church in Sardis, was a reaction to the apostate Catholic Church, prefigured by the church in Thyatira, so the church of brotherly love is a reaction to the dead reformed church.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This reaction will continue as an anti-testimony to both apostate Catholicism and degraded Protestantism until the Lord comes back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Keeping the Lord's Word with the Little Power She Has</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 3:8b the Lord Jesus says, "You have a little power and have kept My word."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One outstanding feature of the church in Philadelphia is that she kept the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to history, no other Christians have kept the Lord's word as strictly as those in the church in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church in Philadelphia, the recovered church, does not care for tradition; she cares for the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church in Philadelphia keeps the Lord's word with the little power she has.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not regard the church in Philadelphia as being strong, powerful, and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whereas we may estimate the church in Philadelphia very highly, the Lord says that she had "a little power."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What pleases the Lord is not that we are strong but that we use our little power to do the best we can.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The strong ones may not please the Lord as much as those who do their best with the little power they have.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not Denying the Lord's Name as the Denominated Sects</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 3:8 the Lord also says that the church in Philadelphia has not denied His name.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brothers who were raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century did not take any name other than the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The word is the Lord's expression, and the name is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The apostate church has deviated from the Lord's word and has become heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reformed church, though recovered to the Lord's word to some extent, has denied the Lord's name by denominating herself with many other names.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The recovered church has not only returned to the Lord's word in a full way but has also abandoned all names other than that of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The recovered church belongs to the Lord absolutely, having nothing to do with any denominations any names .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To deviate from the Lord's word is apostasy, and to denominate the church with any name other than the Lord's is spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church as the chaste virgin betrothed to Christ 2 Cor 11:2 should not have any name other than her Husband's. All other names are an abomination in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the recovered church life we have no teachings of Balaam Rev 2:14 , no teachings of the Nicolaitans 2:15 , no teachings of Jezebel 2:20 , and no mysterious doctrines of Satan 2:24 ; we have only the pure word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, the recovered church has no denominations names but the unique name of the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The deviation from the Word to heresies and the exaltation of so many names other than that of Christ are the most striking signs of degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The return to the pure Word from all heresies and traditions and the exaltation of the Lord's name by abandoning every other name are the most inspiring testimony in the recovered church.</S>
