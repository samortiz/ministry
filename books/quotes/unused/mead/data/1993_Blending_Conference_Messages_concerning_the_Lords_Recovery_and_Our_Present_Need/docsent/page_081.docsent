   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A VITAL GROUP CAN COME INTO BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ONLY BY A SAINT WHO IS DESPERATE AND ABSOLUTE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A vital group can come into being only by a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A vital group begins with one person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It does not begin with nine or ten persons; it begins with one vital saint.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all need to tell the Lord, "Lord, I want to be that saint, a saint who is desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a saint must be desperate and absolute not merely to be vital; he must be desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to our experience, when we are desperate and absolute for the increase of the church, we have a burden to be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not care for the increase but rather are content to see the number in the church remain the same year after year, there is no reason to be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We desire to be vital for a purpose, for a goal, and that is for the increase of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this we need to be desperate and we need to be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To be vital we need to begin by taking this matter as life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we take anything as life or death, we are vital in that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to be desperate and absolute for the increase of the Lord's recovery; then we will be vital.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>SUCH A DESPERATE SAINT WOULD SPONTANEOUSLY CONTACT OTHERS BY THE LORD'S LEADING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Such a desperate saint would spontaneously contact others by the Lord's leading and gain some companion or companions for him to have a vital group.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A vital group cannot be formed by promoting or by giving a message or by exhorting the saints to form vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A vital group can be formed only by a saint who is vital.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the Lord's leading such a vital saint will find some others to be his companions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These will then come together to have intimate and thorough fellowship and begin to vitalize one another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way the genuine vital groups will be formed and produced in the church life from within.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May the Lord give us this kind of desperation and this kind of absoluteness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THOSE IN THE VITAL GROUPS DEFINITELY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>AND ABSOLUTELY FULFILLING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE FIRST FOUR BASIC REQUIREMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are four basic requirements that we must take care of in order to become vital and to be sustained in our vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be definite and absolute to fulfill these requirements.</S>
