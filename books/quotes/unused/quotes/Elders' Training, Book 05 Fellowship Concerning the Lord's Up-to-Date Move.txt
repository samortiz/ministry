The messages contained in this book were released during an elders' training in Anaheim, California from September 23 through 28, 1985
Apparently, Saul was a very ethical and moral person, never stealing, never committing fornication, and never murdering
According to the law he was righteous, but in the eyes of God he was the second greatest enemy to God's economy
The embodiment of God, the very Christ, came to this enemy telling him, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?
Here is a vision for you to bring mainly to My chosen people among the Gentiles, those whom you condemn to the uttermost
Previously we may have understood the inheritance to be a heavenly mansion which we would inherit in the future
He ministered based upon this vision, he ministered with vigor by this vision, and he ministered by taking this vision as his goal
A person can drive many places in the United States, but his driving must be restrained by the white lines on the road
In 2 Corinthians 4:5 he said, 'For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake'
In Matthew 23:8-11, the Lord told the disciples, 'But you, do not be called Rabbi; for one is your Teacher, and you are all brothers
Will you receive the Word in an absolute way and not according to your choice, to your taste, to your preference, or to your priority?
In the time since then some have endeavored to teach something different, to carry out something that differs from the unique ministry
God has given us a foretaste of the things of the coming age, and many of the things of the coming age will be by sight, not by faith
According to my observation nearly all of the elders labor quite much, but in your labor you do not care much for the vision
Around Germany there were different kinds of 'brother' churches, such as the Grace Brothers and even the Mennonites
Small items were also discovered such as baptism by immersion instead of sprinkling; because of this the Baptists were raised up
Immersion is a small item the presbytery is a small item and even the gifts are a very small item in relation to Gods New Testament economy
Perhaps more than ninety percent of the Lord's move in these two thousand years has been carried out by the fundamentalists with the Word
Throughout the past twenty centuries the work of the Spirit has been talked about and experienced by different Christians
If the inner life people stress the inner life as the unique thing as opposed to all other kinds of terminology, that is wrong
The one thing that should be focused on, stressed, and ministered in the Lord's recovery is the New Testament economy of God
The Triune God is dispensing Himself into us by the Father being embodied in the Son and the Son being realized by the Spirit
According to the second point of the vision we have received of the Lord, the Triune God has gone through seven major processes
The Triune God consummated in the all-inclusive Spirit is in the Body, and as such a Spirit He is upon the Body
While Jesus the embodiment of the Triune God was being crucified on the cross essentially speaking the Triune God was passing through death
Colossians 2:14-15 indicates that while Jesus was dying on the cross, the evil angelic powers were struggling to frustrate that death
He is the One taking care of the churches as the High Priest trimming the lamps and filling the lamps with oil
He is also the One who administrates this universe and is going to inherit, to take possession, of both the sea and the land
The seven Spirits, as the intensification of the Triune God, are the seven eyes of the Lion-Lamb to carry out God's New Testament economy
We must go further to see the third point of our vision which involves our facing and overcoming the situation of degradation in the church
God's desire for man to eat the tree of life in Genesis 2 is fulfilled in the Lord's promise to the overcomer to eat of the tree of life
Justification by faith is not 'the thing,' but it is one item in the Lord's progressive recovery of the basic truths
When the cells are 'over-emphasized' in a certain spot of the body, that spot becomes a cancer and kills the body
Many of the tongue-speakers reconcile themselves by saying that there is no need to speak a genuine dialect when one speaks in tongues
After checking with all of them, they all said that they doubted as to whether or not the tongue they were speaking was genuine
Romans 14 teaches us that we should receive one another according to God's receiving and not according to doctrinal concepts
Throughout church history, many missionaries were sent out by the Lord and some of them did much wonderful work
Some among the Pentecostals say that if you do not speak in tongues, you have never been baptized in the Holy Ghost
Verse 4 of chapter two says that God 'desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth'
Verse 9 of the same chapter says that a deacon must be holding the mystery of the faith, that is of what we believe, in a pure conscience
Timothy 517 says Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in word and teaching
The Word was God, the Word became embodied, and the words spoken out of the mouth of this embodiment are spirit
In Matthew 4:4, the Lord said that 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God'
People believed in the word, received the word, and the word became so prevailing in that it grew and multiplied
The good word of God mainly refers to the gospel concerning the Lord's earthly ministry from His incarnation up to His resurrection
The word of righteousness is the solid food referring not to the Christ on this earth, but to the Christ in the heavens
We should not merely have the knowledge of the truth, but the full knowledge, the complete knowledge, the perfect knowledge, of the truth
Paul charged the elders in the church in this way: if you are going to be an elder, you must build up a habit to teach, to be apt to teach
The missionaries who were there in China testified that among all the Christians in China we were on the top in knowing the truth
They were even surprised, and marveled that we, the young Chinese natives, could expound the Bible in such a wonderful way
You all have to realize sin refers to one person, righteousness refers to another person, and judgment refers to a third person
Righteousness refers to Christ who died for your sins, and who resurrected and went to the Father for your justification
As a church, surely all the members have to know the manifestation of the Triune God, to know the mystery of godliness, to know the truth
You may think it is wonderful to teach a little about justification by faith, about holiness, and concerning the gifts
It is not mainly the truth of items such as the presbytery, baptism, or even the smaller item of the miraculous gifts
The truth, of which the church is the pillar and base, is a great truth-the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh through the church
We are in the embodiment of the Triune God realized by the all-inclusive Spirit who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God
Fast and pray that the Lord would open your eyes to see such a vision of the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh through the church
You will have a vision and this vision will govern, direct, control, preserve, and protect you from being led astray
The new believers among us, no doubt, are still in kindergarten, but as a whole, the recovery today is not in kindergarten
We have carried out the standard education passing through kindergarten, elementary, junior high, and even high school
The truth in 1 Timothy 2:4 refers to the mystery of godliness which is the manifestation of the Triune God in the flesh
To pick up all the verses on the divine Word from the twenty-seven books of the New Testament requires a lot of labor
We all have to labor in the Word and in teaching, and we all have to hold the mystery of the faith, the mystery of what we believe in
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
They do not care for the experience of the Triune God, yet they use 2 Corinthians 13:14 as a benediction given on Sunday mornings
Just these two prepositional phrases, 'with the Father' and 'by the Spirit' require at least one week of study
After being baptized in water He stood up, the Holy Spirit as a dove descended upon Him, and the Father spoke from the heavens
Without the divine element His redemption could never be eternal, and the efficacy of the power of His redemption would not be insured
As a man He could only die for one person, but as the eternal God with the eternal element, His death is for millions of people
You need to study the Bible, to study the proper reference books, and to study thousands of pages in the Life-study Messages
We need the enlightenment; then we could see the real significance of His incarnation, of His human living, and of His death
It is not a small matter to know the death of Christ in an all-inclusive way, but who would labor to study these things?
For you to travel to various places to minister the Word without the proper knowledge of the truth is like a blind man driving a car
Let us study as the third item the finalization of the intensification of the Triune God as the sevenfold intensified Spirit
These brothers are going out not to preach a shallow gospel but rather to preach the higher gospel even to preach the Triune God to people
To continue in that is easy, but for us to go out to preach the gospel with the deeper truths is somewhat of an uphill battle
If you sow the poor seed, regardless of how much you labor, the harvest eventually will not be that rich because what you sow is poor
The deeper truths in 1 Corinthians do not include Christ as our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption
Could you explain how God is the head of Christ, Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman ?
Because the Christians lack a view of the deeper truths, they interpreted chapters twelve and fourteen in a very shallow way
If you have the view of the deeper truths, you can see that what Paul is talking about in these two chapters is not that shallow
The first two are the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, and the last two are tongues and interpretation of tongues
Of course, this knowledge is not the knowledge of science or of politics, but the knowledge of God's New Testament economy
The word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God predestined by God for our portion
The word of wisdom is mainly of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching
In chapters twelve and fourteen Paul was trying his best to uplift the Corinthians from their low estate to a higher one
According to the entire book of Hebrews, the word of the beginning of the Christ concerns Christ's earthly ministry
Though we may consider His conception or His incarnation so deep, Paul says that is something at the beginning
He preached the unsearchable riches of Christ not only as truths to the believers, but as the gospel to the Gentiles
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
These riches are all here in the Bible, just like gold in a mine, but nearly no one would labor to dig them out
We should learn to go on, to learn the things in the heavenlies, and to learn to speak these higher and deeper things
One of the ways to study the Bible is to count the occurrences of certain things, and then to arrange them in a good sequence
These verses tell us that the Word became flesh, that the Lord came through incarnation, full of grace and truth
When we refer to the word of grace , the word of truth , and the word of life, we are speaking of the word of the gospel
Especially since the Reformation, many different practices have been raised up, such as the practice of baptism and of the presbytery
The leaders of the two main political parties in China today, the nationalist party and the communist party, are my age
Modern industry caused overproduction which forced the western powers to gain the world markets with the help of their 'gun boats'
We two young people in China, considered as 'natives' by the missionaries, were seeking to know the Bible by means of Darby's synopsis
It is so strange that in the twentieth century, in this top scientific country with so much education, people would believe these things
Peter 1:23 says that we were 'regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God'
In the New Testament phrases such as the life of God the light of God the love of God and the word of Christ denote something in apposition
In the early days, in the Acts, the saints must have used this term, the word, saying, 'Let us speak the word,' or 'Let us preach the word'
They picked up the thought of Mark 161718speaking in new tongues healing picking up serpents and drinking deadly things without being harmed
The subtle one, Satan, can use all the miraculous things, but he can never use anything that is revealed or conveyed by the divine Word
If we behave, work, and live based upon His Word, whatever we are, whatever we do, how we behave, and how we work will be solidly based
We cannot minister grace and truth and life to others without the word of grace, the word of truth, and the word of life
That was simply the word of the law, not the word of grace, the word of truth, the word of life, or the word of the gospel
Our problem today is the superficial replacement of Christ with the so-called gifts and the practice of the gifts
Paul in 1 Corinthians 12:8-10 still gave ground to these things, but he put the miraculous gifts at the 'tail' of the list of gifts
The first aspect of the manifestation of the Spirit is the word of wisdom, and the second is the word of knowledge
The traditional way for the Christians to meet is to have a gathering, to gather the members of the church or perhaps some unbelievers
At one time, Brother Nee strongly insisted on cancelling the Sunday morning meetings so that the saints could preach the gospel
Some may argue that even the unbelievers like to go to church on Sundays to attend the service, and that we should take advantage of this
In the first two or three weeks Brother Nee said that the best way to have these fellowship meetings was to give testimonies
We all could have some testimony, testimonies of our repentance, testimonies of our salvation, or testimonies of our daily walk
They did not drop the small group meetings altogether, but without realizing it, there was an unnoticeable decline
These eleven hundred and four newly baptized believers were brought in by just about ten percent of the church in Taipei
Only a little over three hundred practiced the speaking of the gospel, yet at that time they were baptizing people every day
In verse 26 Paul says Whenever you come together each one has a psalm has a teaching has a revelation has a tongue has an interpretation
Peter, on the day of Pentecost, made use of the temple as a kind of convenience to preach the gospel and to teach the Word
Once they became believers in Christ and were baptized, however, they began to meet in a way initiated, invented, and ordained of the Spirit
They may have referred to the Old Testament, but it must have been that they spoke what they heard Peter speaking on that day
The main subject of Peter's speaking was Christ incarnated, living on this earth, crucified, resurrected, and ascended
A number of us have been speaking in the recovery and our speaking has really spoiled the function of all the saints especially the new ones
In a good sense our speaking helps people but in another sense a greater sense our speaking really annuls the function of so many believers
Genesis 1 first says that God created the heavens and the earth and then the Spirit of God brooded over the death waters
Now we must fully come back to the God-invented and God-ordained way to meet in order to kill the traditional way
The principle is that we have to shift from the traditional man-made way of meeting to the God-created and God-ordained way of meeting
Because we are building, we must expect some failures, yet in this expectation there is much possibility of a success
To take the way of the home meetings and the way of mutuality and speaking is a hard burden to put into practice
The mothers who cook for their families should set an example and then turn the cooking over to their daughters to let them learn
Your control in your locality only does one thing-it limits the Lord's move by killing and annulling others' functions
We must come back and practice the Biblical way God ordained, the way God instituted-the way of mutuality and speaking
Corinthians 14:26 indicates that when the whole church comes together in one place, individuality should not be practiced but mutuality
Paul said that when the church comes together 'each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
There is not a hint in the New Testament that shows that in the church meeting there should be just one or two persons speaking
To work this out you need to spend at least five years to labor day and night, but to go the way of selection is easy
There is a Chinese proverb that says to raise up a tree takes ten years, but to raise up a person takes one hundred years
Learn first to speak how Christ as the incarnated Savior is now our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption
Speak about how Christ, after being righteousness, sanctification, and redemption to us, is now the life-giving Spirit transforming us
We all are His brethren and we should be the same as He is, possessing humanity with divinity mingled together
We are here in the Lord's recovery endeavoring to climb up, but some may be helping people to 'go down to the basement'
We are helping people to advance to 'college' in the ministry, but some may be bringing people back to 'kindergarten'
Your heart may be good and what you do may be right, but the stage of your teaching may be wrong and the direction may also be wrong
To say that Christ is the rock is easy, but to say that the revelation of Christ is the rock requires much study of the revelation
Every denomination claims that their foundation is Christ, that Christ is the rock upon which they build their denomination
What Paul did in his day did not come out at his own time, but eventually we are here enjoying the issue of his labor
If the physical life takes time for growth and development, how could we expect the spiritual life to be fully grown overnight?
Strictly speaking, six verses in the New Testament say something about how the believers should meet-Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor
They met to exhort one another, and they were to exhort one another even more as they saw the day drawing near
In the saints' meetings they did not have a big speaker, but they assembled themselves together to mutually exhort one another
All of the six verses we have referred to show that in the early days the believers always met in the way of mutuality in speaking
Matthew 18:20, strictly speaking, is the only verse in the Gospels which tells us something about the believers' meetings
In order for a proper relationship to be maintained between the believers, these four items are absolutely necessary
One who is humble would not stumble others, would take care of the sinning ones, the backsliding saints, and would always forgive others
If he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
If he does not hear you, you should take with you one or two more that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
If the sinning brother refuses to hear the church, the Word tells us to let him be to us as a Gentile and a tax collector
According to the context, the two or three are gathered together into the Lord's name for the purpose of praying for the sinning one
It is only by these four factors that a good relationship can be maintained between the believers for the building up of a local church
Sometimes if the number of saints meeting is over ten it would still be hard for you to render the practical help
In Matthew 18:20 the Lord did not say where two or three meet together but where two or three are gathered together
These two or three are gathered by the unseen Lord because they love the Lord and they are concerned for the Lord's members
To be gathered into the name of the Lord means to get yourself out of anything that is besides the Lord Himself
Matthew 18:20 does not mean that we are gathered in the name of the Lord but that we are gathered out of self into Him
It is when we are gathered out of ourselves and out of all things other than the Lord and into Him that He is among us
In a locality for the building up of a local church we should meet by small numbers and we should meet by being gathered
However, as long as all the meetings in your locality are big meetings, laity is there and a very secret, hidden clergy is being built up
The only thing that can kill and tear down the clergy-laity system and destroy the foundation of hierarchy is to have the small meetings
In the New Testament there is no such thing as the church of the apostles, the church of the elders, or the church of the evangelists
In the New Testament there are only three designations of the church the church of God the church of Christ and the church of the saints
They are trembling and fearful to keep their position and to keep the church in their locality under their hand
The elders would not control they would not be afraid of losing their position and they would like to see everybody be better than they are
The Lord told the church in Philadelphia that He had the key of David and that He had put before them an open door which no one could shut
The recovery has been existing on this earth for sixty years among us and it has been existing in a prevailing way
Newspapers are everywhere, as are every kind of book, magazine, or other printed media, full of the written word
In the United States and Canada among the Protestants, the Baptists have the highest membership with over twenty-five million
In them there is no word at all, not even a hint, that they cared for the so-called baptism in the Holy Ghost, yet they were very powerful
Penn-Lewis considered the practices of Pentecostalism to be related to the latent power of the soul, related to the demons
One of the elders in Taiwan, before he was saved, was one of the top experts in practicing the latent power of the soul
Even up until now, in the past two centuries, no writings on the inner life have ever reached such a high level as those of Austin-Sparks
Although he did not speak in tongues, he began to speak by walking around the hall, speaking continually for three hours
It was only in the last part of its history, since the middle of the last century, that Pentecostalism was raised up
Even in these last one and a half centuries many wonderful things have happened in the church besides Pentecostalism
Mackintosh, and William Kelley, produced writings not only full of knowledge, but full of power and full of life
The only difference was that the Reformation widely propagated itself, while the Brethren movement sought to conceal itself
In those meetings there was no speaking in tongues, even though speaking in tongues had already begun in England
Moody, and Jonathan Edwards in America are among the other giants in church history who never practiced the Pentecostal things
Whoever is skillful in using the Word of God is powerful, and their work remains because it is built up with the solid Word
The trainings may have been like a cloud through which you passed for ten days, receiving little of a permanent deposit
How many of the elders could give a message on the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man from Romans 8?
The truths taught by you will remain solidly as a rock for the seeking Christians to work on, to live on, and to stand upon
By this you will become teachers and will be able to teach every saint in your locality to speak the same thing
Today there are at least four different theologies-secular theology, reformed theology, fundamental theology, and Brethren theology
In his Synopsis of the Books of the Bible, Darby opened up the Bible not only in a general way but with so many basic principles
You must have an adequate knowledge of these two kinds of teachings, the Brethren teachings and the inner life teachings
Because of this Arminianism sprang up in opposition, stating that even though you have been saved, you may still perish
We take the latter line, for without this there is no reconciliation between God's selection and man's responsibility
You must learn Brethren theology, you must learn the inner life teachings, and you must know where Calvinism and Reformed theology stand
If you have these five things as the governing principles for your interpretation of the Bible, you will be safe
Reformed theology rejects the thought of dispensations and believes that the Old Testament is the same as the New Testament
We have also received the heavenly gift of the divine life, and the Holy Spirit, so we are the partakers of the Holy Spirit
The enlightenment, the heavenly gift, the Holy Spirit, and the good word of God belong to the present age, the age of grace
The previous age was the age of law, this present age is the age of grace, and the age to come is the age of the kingdom
Miracles are not related to our spirit, but to our bodies; however, regeneration is absolutely related to our spirit
That imparting of the divine life has nothing to do with miracles and is absolutely a spiritual matter of life
During the Lord Jesus' earthly ministry many were healed or raised from the dead, but they all eventually died
Elisha performed many miracles, among which were the raising of the Shunammite's dead son and the healing of Naaman the leper
The cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox
The sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den
They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea
Also regarding the coming age Isaiah 35510 says Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped
Shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert
Isaiah 6525 says The wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock and dust shall be the serpents meat
A small portion of the promises in the Old Testament are related to the coming age such as the ones from Isaiah
They are a new creation , not according to the old nature of the flesh, but according to the new nature of the divine life
Out of this fallen creation God chose some out of mankind to be regenerated with His life and even with Himself to make them a new creation
By that time many of the descendants of Adam will have died already; some will still be living on the earth and the Lord will judge them
The goats will go to the lake of fire and the sheep will be transferred into the millennium on the earth to be the nations
Revelation 20:8-9 tells us that at the end of the millennium some of the nations will be instigated by Satan to rebel against God
In Revelation 21 there are two categories of people-the peoples of God on the new earth and the sons of God in eternity
The peoples of God are not regenerated but restored to their created condition which was lost due to the fall of Adam
Through Christ's redemption, the heaven, the earth, and all created things were reconciled, redeemed back to God
Christ's redemption is not only for us, the regenerated people, but also for all the things in the heavens and the earth
One function is to produce the fruit to feed the believers and the other function is to produce leaves for the healing of the nations
The remnant of these living ones will be transferred into the new earth and will be the nations, the peoples of God around the New Jerusalem
The miracles, the works of power, do not belong to God's new creation but to the restoration of God's old creation
During the age of the new creation the age of grace for certain purposes the Lord borrowed the works of power the miracles from another age
John 22325 says Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover during the feast many believed in His name when they saw the signs which He did
The word 'but' at the beginning of 3:1 indicates that this case of Nicodemus differs from the cases in the foregoing verses 2:23-25
The Lord would not commit Himself to those who believed in Him by seeing the signs which He did, but another man came
To be born again is to be regenerated with the divine life, other than the human life received by natural birth
To regenerate Nicodemus is one thing and to have others believe in Him because of seeing the miracles He did is another thing
Many thousands of people were either healed by the Lord or directly affected by the miracles He performed in His earthly ministry
1 Corinthians 15:6 even tells us that the Lord appeared to five hundred brothers at one time after His resurrection
After the Lord's labor for three and a half years, however, we can only see one hundred and twenty faithful ones
In the first chapter of Corinthians Paul says that God has called us into the fellowship of His Son who is Gods power and Gods wisdom to us
Paul encouraged the saints in Corinth to prophesy, to speak for Christ, to speak forth Christ, and to speak Christ
One of the reasons for the problems with the Corinthians was their exaltation of the miraculous speaking in tongues
Paul indicated in his Epistle to them that it was absolutely wrong for them to go back to the law because today is the day of grace
They had been enlightened they had tasted of the heavenly gift they had received the Holy Spirit and were even partaking of this Holy Spirit
They had also tasted the good word of God, but they remained in the initial stage of the enjoyment of the New Testament blessings
The rudiments or primary elements of the beginning of the oracles of God are in the category of the word as milk not as solid food
Verse 13 continues, 'For everyone who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe'
The entire revelation of the book of Hebrews shows us that Christ has an earthly ministry and also a heavenly ministry
Through that ministry we were all redeemed back to God through 'repentance from dead works and of faith toward God'
Through His earthly ministry we were also baptized into Him and all our negative things were washed away and terminated
The Hebrews received the gospel to this extent, but they never realized that Christ has another ministry, a ministry in the heavens
Hebrews also mentions the heavenly gifts , the heavenly things , the heavenly country , and the heavenly Jerusalem
The Hebrew believers were remaining in the initial stage of salvation and would not go on to the heavenly ministry of Christ
In Hebrews 6:1 Paul says, 'Wherefore, leaving the word of the beginning of the Christ, let us be brought on to maturity'
Leaving the good word of God we need to be brought on to maturity which is to advance from Christs earthly ministry to His heavenly ministry
The heavenly Christ is in the Holy of Holies in the heavenly tabernacle and the way into the Holy of Holies has been made for us
The Hebrew believers had tasted, in the first stage of God's salvation, the good word of God and the works of power of the coming age
Hunger may refer to a situation where there is no way to obtain food; involuntary fasting may refer to a situation of poverty
Paul was such a great apostle who established so many churches, yet no church among these churches would have anything in common with him
To have everything in common according to what was practiced in the book of Acts was altogether over by Paul's time
Paul even had to exhort the Corinthians to bring their money on the first day of every week to give to the Lord
Throughout church history there were a number of times when Christians tried to practice having everything in common
Despite the extraordinary works of power God performed through Paul, Paul eventually had a thorn in his flesh which God would not remove
Paul also told us that he labored more abundantly than all the apostles, yet he said it was not him but the grace of God
Paul's experience and labor was of and by the divine grace, which is the Triune God as life to us for our enjoyment
The Gospel of John tells us that when the Lord came, grace came and that He as the incarnated God was full of grace
Paul's intimate spiritual son, Timothy, was instructed by Paul to take the natural way for healing his stomach sickness
Paul and his coworkers were under the discipline of the inner life in this time of suffering rather than under the power of the outward gift
In the decline of the church and in suffering for the church, the gift of power is not as much needed as the grace in life
Any group throughout church history that practiced the gift of healing extensively, has been eventually exposed for pretense and falsehood
During this ritual the brother who now meets with us saw this Pentecostal leader about to add something to the water to change it into wine
When this leader realized he was being watched, he stopped what he was doing and waited until a later time to 'change the water into wine'
Many Christians who were all seeking, spiritual, and mature, eventually had a certain kind of disease that ended their life
Once you get addicted to morphine, you will always come to it again and again even though you know it is not so healthy
It has been documented that the Mormons, in their early days, practiced all the miracles, including tongue-speaking
It has also been documented that not only the Mormons practiced tongue-speaking but also the ancient Egyptians spoke in tongues
A brother among us from Ghana told us that he saw tongue-speaking by the pagan priests and priestesses in their idol worship
The townspeople would try to check out which of the priests and priestesses were false and which ones were not
When this brother from Ghana was saved and saw Christians doing similar things, that was quite a surprise to him
At least the people in this village in Ghana checked out the prophecy to see whether or not it would come true
In this age, there is sometimes the need of miraculous things to prove that what God does in this age is genuine
We need much labor to help all the saints to realize the new way and to participate in the divine speaking mutually
In this matter we can quote Philippians 4:13: 'I can do all things,' especially to carry on the small meetings, 'in Him who empowers me'
The truth concerning the small group meetings is mainly based upon Acts, where there is the meeting from house to house
If they just begin to meet in their home with their spouse and children once a week, this will be a big advance
You do not need to tell the saints in the home meetings to meet to preach the gospel or to seek after the deeper truth
There is no need for the elders to make a decision that this week is a gospel week, and that all the home meetings have to preach the gospel
Some elders may think that the saints have no right to establish a meeting in their homes without the permission of the elders
If some of these saints who love the Lord enter into an environment where their experience is needed, they would be very useful
They were considered to be the 'weaker ones' among us, but when they went out they became the leaders of these groups
There is a great problem concerning full-timers which demands our attention-the matter of how to make a living by going full-time
A certain missionary living in the interior of China did not know how much money would come into the central office
She only asked our oldest child, who at that time was about seven, and his sister who was five to pray with her
They knelt down by the bed and prayed, 'Lord, we are in this situation and you know we do not know what to live on tomorrow'
My wife went to the seashore like the poor people to pick up things that were carried to the shore by the tide
The churches with all the saints should be careful, should be diligent, and should be faithful in giving to take care of the need
