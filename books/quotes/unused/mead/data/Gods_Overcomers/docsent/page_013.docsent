   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All victories should take the victory of Christ as a pattern: As I also overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Three Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible tells us that we have three different enemies: 1 the flesh, within us, 2 the world, outside of us, and 3 Satan, above and below us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As far as the church s ascended position is concerned, Satan is below us.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ came to destroy Satan 1 John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, subjection to the Spirit is victory over the flesh, the love for the Father is victory over the world, and faith in Christ is victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first thing that came in was the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One day, the archangel tried to uplift himself to be like God by means of the self, and the self entered the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was the beginning of sin, the world, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the time God created man, He bestowed on him the highest ability, the ability to reproduce, by which he can pass his life on to his offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Originally God expected man to eat the fruit of the tree of life so that he would have God s life to pass on to his offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God forbade him to eat the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Satan came and committed spiritual fornication with the first couple in their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Satan put his poisonous seed within them so that they passed this on to their offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Satan is the father of liars.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The seed of Satan is lies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The seed of God is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The principle with which Satan beguiled Adam to sin is the same principle as that which caused Satan himself to sin at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Satan has his household and kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He gains men to be the members of his household and citizens of his kingdom so that he can be the king over them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Satan beguiled man to sin, his work was confined from the universe to just the earth, the world.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He was cursed: Upon your stomach you will go, / And dust you will eat / All the days of your life Gen 3:14 .</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Victory of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before the Lord Jesus began to minister, He was baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means that His work during the three and a half years was carried out after His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, there was no flesh in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can call this three and a half years as a living of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord Jesus never walked according to His will but according to the will of Him who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He did the Father s will and also waited for the Father s time John 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan tempted the Lord to do something without God s word by asking Him to turn stones into bread.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said many times that He only spoke what He had heard, and in John 5:30 He said, I can do nothing from Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that He did not consider the self as His source.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Satan always wants man to justify himself after God has already justified him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is like Satan trying to persuade the Lord to declare that He was the Son of God after God had already declared this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The crucifixion of the Lord was according to the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He prayed in Gethsemane, Not as I will, but as You will Matt 26:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If this cannot pass away unless I drink it, Your will be done Matt 26:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At the end He said, The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John 18:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be able to accept the cross is a victory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not to be shaken by things inwardly or outwardly is a victory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Overcoming is having nothing of the flesh within, nothing of the world without, and nothing of Satan below.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Throughout His life, the Lord did not allow the flesh to come into His living.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He always put aside the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord was the first One from whom Satan could gain nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Neither the flesh nor the world had any ground in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God Intending the Church</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>to Live Out the Victory of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God s salvation of man is to save him from the flesh, the world, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God wants us to refuse everything that is from the world, earth, self, flesh, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Satan attacks us through the world and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Only those who are absolutely spiritual, who have absolutely refused the worldly system and the will of the flesh, will be attacked by Satan directly.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The cross of Christ needs the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If a sinner merely accepts the cross objectively, only he himself will gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, if we accept the cross subjectively, God will gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The cross of Christ cuts off like a knife everything of the old creation, while His resurrection brings us into a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The victory of Christ is seen in 1 the crucifixion which removes the whole old creation on the negative side, 2 the resurrection which brings in a new beginning on the positive side, and 3 the ascension which secures for Him the position of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The church lives out Christ s victory on earth by the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The cross should be planted in the center of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God wants us to be responsible for the cross cutting off of that part of the old creation which is known to us.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God does not want us to be responsible for that part of the old creation which is not known to us.</S>
