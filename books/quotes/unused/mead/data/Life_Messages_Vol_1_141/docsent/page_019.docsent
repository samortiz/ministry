   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How can I deal with the Lord to get Him to act on my prayers?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This question opens up a field that covers the whole Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To answer briefly, I would say that most of our efforts to know the Lord's will are futile.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What we think is His will turns out to be incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The right way is just to contact the Lord in the same way as you breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Open to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, when the time comes, something will come to you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That will be the Lord's will.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Can you recommend some specific materials to use in our times with the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more variety you have, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You need at least ten minutes of prayer and at least ten minutes of reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you have an hour's time, you can read three chapters from the Old Testament and one from the New; in this way you can finish the Bible in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As for spiritual writings, I surely recommend the Life-study Messages and the issues of the Stream magazine, published in the early years.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition, read the books The Economy of God, The All-inclusive Christ, The Knowledge of Life, and The Experience of Life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This last book would be especially helpful, since some chapters treat in detail how to deal with the conscience, the heart, the flesh, and the natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Try to build up a habit of praying the whole day long.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During your time in the morning, pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At your break time, pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Replace your vain talk and gossip with prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You will see how much more time you have to pray if you avoid the phone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One year Brother Nee read through the New Testament every week.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He did not drop any duties, but just carried a little New Testament with him wherever he went.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By squeezing in a minute here and two minutes there, he read it through fifty-two times in that one year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we can learn to use our time this carefully, there will be plenty of time to pray, read the Bible, and read some spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I greatly enjoy going back over the Life-study Messages, even though they were given by me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Just as a housewife enjoys her own cooking, so I am refreshed and nourished when I read over the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I long that the saints in the Lord's recovery may be able to digest them more.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you try this for half a year, it will make a big difference in your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My Christian life is like a pendulum swinging back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Is this normal?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is normal, but only for a baby.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not be troubled about feeling that way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just keep praying daily, reading the Bible daily, and digesting a Life-study Message or one of our spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Within a half year you will be steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You will be rooted and grounded, and nothing will be able to shake you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Ephesians 4:14 says, "Be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of teaching" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>. Every teaching is a wind blowing people away from the center lane.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you can be carried away by this wind, then you are still a child.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 15 mentions this: "Holding the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>. Do not be preoccupied with how you feel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Just go on and build some good Christian habits.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Your feelings are not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just tell them, "Little devil, I don't believe in you."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No matter how you feel, just keep these legalities we have mentioned: pray, read the Bible and some spiritual books, and deal with your conscience by confession.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever is on your conscience as an offense, confess right away to the Lord, asking Him to cleanse you and keep you constantly with a purged, pure conscience.</S>
