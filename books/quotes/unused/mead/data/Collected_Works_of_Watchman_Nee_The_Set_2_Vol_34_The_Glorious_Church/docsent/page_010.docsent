   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE TYPE OF EVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In creation two persons were created: one was Adam and the other was Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both were created human beings, but each typify something different.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 15 says that Adam was a type of the Lord Jesus, and Romans 5 says that Adam was a figure of the man who was to come.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Adam, then, foreshadowed Christ; he portrayed Christ in figure.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In other words, all that God purposed in Adam was to be achieved in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But besides Adam in the creation, there was also the woman, Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God very carefully recorded the creation of this woman in Genesis 2, and when we come to Ephesians 5 we are clearly told that Eve typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, we can see that God's eternal will is achieved partly through Christ and partly through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for us to understand how the church can achieve God's will on earth, we must learn from Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The purpose of this book is not to discuss the type of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we will not consider this matter here; rather, the emphasis is upon Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are not focusing our thoughts upon the work of Christ, but upon the position the church occupies in relation to that work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we read Genesis 2:18-24 and Ephesians 5:22-32 we find that a woman is mentioned in both places.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Genesis 2 there is a woman, and in Ephesians 5 there is also a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first woman is a sign typifying the church; the second woman is the first woman.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first woman was planned by God before the foundation of the world and appeared before the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second woman was also planned before the foundation of the world, but was revealed after the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although one appeared before the fall and the other after, there is no difference in God's sight: the church is the Eve of Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God created Adam to typify Christ; God also created Eve to typify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's purpose is not only accomplished by Christ but is also accomplished by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Genesis 2:18, the Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's purpose in creating the church is that she may be the help meet of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ alone is only half; there must be another half, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that in God's sight Christ alone is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Genesis 2:18-24 reiterates the events of the sixth day of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the sixth day God created Adam, but afterward it seems that He considered a little and said, "No, it is not good that the man should be alone."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, He created Eve for Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By then, everything was completed, and we find that Genesis 1 ends with this record: "And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good" v. 31 . From this we realize that having Adam alone, or we may say, having Christ alone, is not enough to satisfy God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With God there must also be Eve, that is, there must also be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then His heart will be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In other words, God desired to have both Adam and Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His purpose is to have a victorious Christ plus a victorious church, a Christ who has overcome the work of the devil plus a church which has overthrown the work of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His purpose is to have a ruling Christ and a ruling church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what God planned for His own pleasure, and He has performed it for His own satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It has been done because God desired to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God desired to have Christ, and God also desired to have a church which is exactly like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God not only desired that Christ would have dominion, He also wants the church to have dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God allows the devil on earth because He said, "Let them," Christ and the church, "have dominion."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God purposed that the church, as Christ's counterpart, should take part in dealing with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the church does not match Christ, God's purpose will not be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In warfare Christ needs a help meet, and even in glory He also needs a help meet.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God requires the church to be the same as Christ in every respect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is God's desire that Christ should have a help meet.</S>
