The Lord's word here implies that the tax collectors and sinners knew their own position and therefore drew near to the Lord, but that the Pharisees were self-righteous and therefore blamed the Lord for being gracious toward the tax collectors and sinners.</P><P>Verse 13:"But go and learn what this means, `I desire mercy and not sacrifice,' for I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners." The only "righteous" people in the world are the self-righteous, as were the Pharisees. Mercy is part of grace. Grace comes only from above. However, men do not like to receive grace; they prefer to give something, such as a sacrifice, to God. God desires that man come just as he is to receive grace. This is the only ground of fellowship. (To repent is to expose one's real condition, to simply admit what one is.) Here it shows that men many times condemn grace. Although the Lord has dealings with sinners, the Bible says that He is separated from sin. Therefore, only those who are separated from sin may draw near to sinners.</P><P>In the foregoing section, in the calling of Matthew, the Lord replied to the protest of the Pharisees. From 9:14 on, the Lord answered the protest of John's disciples.</P><P>Verse 14:"Then the disciples of John came to Him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast much, but Your disciples do not fast?" John somewhat practiced asceticism.</P><P>Verse 15:"And Jesus said to them, The sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn as long as the Bridegroom is with them, can they? But days will come when the Bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast." " Taken away" refers to the Lord's being rejected, not to His ascension. The Lord's ascension was for Him to receive glory, so there was no need for the disciples to fast. Therefore, here His being taken away does not refer to His ascension. The "Bridegroom" was the Lord, and the "sons of the bridechamber" were the disciples. Later, the disciples will become the bride. In the transitional period, the Lord considered His disciples as the sons of the bridechamber. The Lord was taken away from them as a result of the Jews' rejection of Him.</P><P>Verse 16:"No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made." Here the "unfulled cloth," or the "new cloth," signifies the outward living, whereas the "new wine" signifies the inward life. A garment is exposed on the outside, and wine ferments within. One is the living and the other is life. One is objective and the other is subjective. The New Testament gospel gives an outward living and conduct to man as a new cloth and imparts an inward life into man as new wine.</P><P>The regulations and ordinances of the law are like the old garment; fasting is one of them. To mix the new and the old is to use the gospel to help the law. The best that this can do is to patch, but it can also cause a tear. For example, circumcision is an important matter. However, Galatians shows us that there is no need for circumcision. Romans says that man cannot be justified by the law; Galatians says that man cannot be sanctified by the law. Just as the law is unable to justify man, so it is unable to sanctify man. This is precisely what the Lord teaches here. The law in the aspect of commandments is one thing, and the law in the aspect of principle is another thing. The commandments of the law were complemented by the Lord, but the principle of the law was put aside by Him. In the Epistles, the phrase " by faith" should be rendered " by the principle of faith"-for example, " The righteous shall have life and live by the principle of faith" (Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11).</P><P>Verse 17:"Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins; otherwise, the wineskins burst, and the wine pours out, and the wineskins are ruined; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved." Wine here refers to the inward life. "New wine" means that the fermenting power has not ceased. The life that the Lord put in us is like the new wine. The old wineskins signify the ordinances of the law. When the new wine is put into old wineskins, "the wineskins burst." For example, one who has the new life cannot keep the Old Testament law of "an eye for an eye"; hence, it bursts. Therefore, putting the new life given by the Lord into the old ordinances of the law will cause them to burst.</P><P>In Matthew 5-7 we see not only the fresh wineskins but also the fresh wineskins with new wine. The outward commandments are the highest expression of our inward life. Matthew 5-7 reveals what we have received within to show us that we can do the things mentioned therein. The old wine signifies the fleshly life. "Both are preserved"; that is, both the new wine and the old wineskin are preserved. This means that when the law is put aside, it is preserved.</P><P>Verse 18:"As He was speaking these things to them, behold, a ruler came and worshipped Him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she will live." Matthew does not tell us that the name of the ruler of the synagogue is Jairus (Mark 5:22), nor does he tell us in the previous chapter, that the name of the demon possessed man is Legion (Luke 8:30). Matthew seldom mentions names, because he presents the Lord as the King. It is not necessary to mention names, since they are insignificant before the Lord. The name Jairus means "the enlightening one."</P><P>Matthew says that the daughter "has just died," whereas Luke says that she "was dying." This is because Matthew records the situation after her death, and Luke narrates her condition from the beginning. Each Gospel has its own characteristic, and it records only the aspect that is related to its characteristic. The Gospel of Luke is written for the Gentiles; hence, it mentions only the things that are related to this aspect. On the other hand, because the Gospel of Matthew is written to the Jews, it stresses the aspect of doctrine and therefore uses this event as a type of the Jews' death and their future restoration.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_028.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_030.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 15: Study on Matthew &nbsp; pg 29</div><br></body></html>
