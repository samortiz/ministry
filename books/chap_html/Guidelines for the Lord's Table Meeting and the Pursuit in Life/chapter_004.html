<h1 class="title">SELECTING HYMNS<br />
IN THE FELLOWSHIP MEETING<br />
AND THE LORD&rsquo;S TABLE MEETING</h1>
<h2 class="head1">TEN KINDS OF HYMNS IN THE COURSE OF A MEETING</h2>
<p>In the course of a meeting, there is the need for ten different kinds of hymns: first, for opening; second, for introducing the subject; third, for strengthening; fourth, for uplifting the spirit; fifth, for turning; sixth, for correction; seventh, for maintaining the spirit; eighth, for filling up the time; ninth, for conclusion; and tenth, for lingering or sending off. Also, if we do not know the categories of hymns, the nature of the hymns, it will be difficult for us to consider other matters. In order to select hymns in a meeting, we must first know the nature of the hymns; some hymns are on gospel preaching, some are on spiritual warfare, others are on praising, and yet others are on building. We must know the different hymn categories before we can properly select them. The progression of the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting and the prayer meeting can be divided into ten steps or sections. A meeting does not always require this many sections, but in general it may consist of not more than these ten sections.</p>
<p>At the beginning of a meeting, we should select an opening hymn with much consideration. After the opening hymn we need an introductory hymn to lead us to the subject of the meeting. If the spirit of the meeting is not strong enough after the introduction, we need to call a strengthening hymn. However, if the spirit is still not strong enough, we should select a hymn that uplifts the spirit. Sometimes the introductory hymn may lead to the wrong subject. For example, if we should be praising, but someone selects a hymn concerning confessing our sins, there is the need for an immediate turn, or a correction. For example, in a Lord&rsquo;s table meeting someone may choose a hymn for the worship of the Father while we are still remembering the Lord, or in a prayer meeting someone may choose a hymn of praise. In both of these instances there is the need for turning. During a meeting that is prolonged, there may be the need for a hymn to maintain the spirit, to prevent the spirit from being weakened. In order to fill up the time, there also may be the need for a time-filling hymn. Finally, there is a concluding hymn. However, there are times after a meeting has ended when everyone wants to linger on. When this happens, we can choose a hymn to send everyone off. I hope we can remember all of these principles in selecting hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN EXERCISE IN SELECTING HYMNS<br />
FOR THE FELLOWSHIP MEETING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Selecting the Opening Hymn</h2>
<p>Now let us consider the hymns for the fellowship meeting. Suppose the saints are like plain water that is neither sweet nor sour nor spicy and thus are indifferent toward the Lord when they come together for the fellowship meeting. Which hymn should we select for opening the meeting? Someone may suggest <em>Hymns,</em> #395, &ldquo;O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me, / And all thing else recede.&rdquo; This hymn is not appropriate. It is not a general hymn but rather has a specific purpose; such a hymn can be used in leading to a particular subject. Another person may suggest <em>Hymns,</em> #960, &ldquo;My King will soon come back again.&rdquo; This hymn is acceptable but still not adequate. Because it is a longer hymn, it is suitable as an opening hymn, to give the saints time for their hearts to be settled and for their spirits to be uplifted. This hymn is a better choice than <em>Hymns,</em> #395 because it reminds us of the condition at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #423, &ldquo;Thou hidden love of God,&rdquo; is also good because it does not have a specific theme. Hymn #352 in the Chinese hymnal, &ldquo;Though we waver as the seasons, / He will every change endure,&rdquo; is a good hymn and is probably the best choice for a fellowship meeting, but we cannot sing this hymn every time. Consequently, we need to have more hymns in reserve. We need to practice continually. <em>Hymns,</em> #578, &ldquo;My will is weak, my strength is frail,&rdquo; is quite a deep hymn. Hymn #625 in the Chinese hymnal, &ldquo;O Lord, we gather before Thy face,&rdquo; has the flavor of spiritual pursuit and may therefore be used in a prayer meeting. Hymn #353 in the Chinese hymnal, &ldquo;Once I had a fervent heart,&rdquo; is somewhat related to spiritual pursuit and may also be used in a prayer meeting.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #693, &ldquo;He faileth not, for He is God,&rdquo; is not that suitable because the train of thought in this hymn does not match our subject. <em>Hymns,</em> #437, &ldquo;Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him,&rdquo; is also inappropriate because the feeling of this hymn is very high. In the fellowship meeting, which does not have a particular subject, we should not use hymns that have a specific subject. <em>Hymns,</em> #720, &ldquo;God hath not promised skies always blue, / Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through,&rdquo; is not suitable. This is a good hymn to sing to comfort those who have suffered a domestic misfortune. <em>Hymns,</em> #370, &ldquo;Abide with me! fast falls the eventide,&rdquo; is not suitable. If we sing this hymn to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence when the sun is setting, it would be quite good. Or if someone is dying, we can sing this hymn with his or her family.</p>
<p><em>Hymns,</em> #492, &ldquo;In all thy work, O Lord, Thou didst,&rdquo; is a very deep hymn with a specific subject; hence, it is not suitable as an opening hymn. <em>Hymns,</em> #207, &ldquo;Lord Jesus! when we think of Thee, / Of all Thy love and grace,&rdquo; is toward the Lord; hence, it cannot be used as an opening hymn in a fellowship meeting. <em>Hymns,</em> #333, &ldquo;I know not why God&rsquo;s wondrous grace / To me He hath made known,&rdquo; cannot be used because the chorus is a quotation from the Bible; it is very specific. <em>Hymns,</em> #707 is on counting God&rsquo;s blessing and therefore is not appropriate. <em>Hymns,</em> #657, &ldquo;Can you be obedient / To the Lord of all,&rdquo; is a challenging hymn and therefore is not suitable. <em>Hymns,</em> #1048, &ldquo;Just as I am, without one plea,&rdquo; should be used in gospel preaching. <em>Hymns,</em> #397, &ldquo;More holiness give me,&rdquo; can be sung at the beginning of a fellowship meeting when there is a feeling of insipidness. <em>Hymns,</em> #280, &ldquo;Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me, / Wash all my sins away,&rdquo; is barely acceptable. <em>Hymns,</em> #705, &ldquo;In some way or other the Lord will provide,&rdquo; is very specific and therefore not appropriate.</p>
