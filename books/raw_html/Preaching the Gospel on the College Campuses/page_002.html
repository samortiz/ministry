<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT AND THE BODY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4a; 1 Cor. 12:13; Acts 4:8, 31; 6:10; 7:55; 13:4, 9; 15:28; Rom. 12:5; 1 Cor. 12:27; Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 22:17</h1><p>This book covers some important matters concerning the young people going to the college campuses to preach the gospel. This work, however, should not exclude the other saints. When the young people go to the campuses, they need the backing of the older and middle-aged saints. When saints of all ages stand together in an excellent coordination, we will have an effective and fruitful work of preaching the gospel on the campuses.<p>In this chapter we will cover two points—the Spirit and the Body. In the next chapter, we will cover three more points—prayer, the Word, and the homes. We need prayer, the Word, and the homes to be effective in preaching the gospel on the campuses. In the last chapter, we will cover two more points—a proper daily living and a universal love. We also need a proper daily living and a universal love for the campus work.<h2 class=head1>THE REVELATION OF THE SPIRIT AND THE BODY</h2><h2 class=head2>The Revelation of the Spirit</h2><p>In the Lord’s recovery, we have been opposed because of our stress on the Spirit. This opposition is related to religious traditions, especially traditions based upon the creeds. In the past some of us may have read and even recited the creeds. Fifty years ago, however, we dropped the creeds because they are incomplete. They cannot contain the entire divine revelation.<p>In the Nicene Creed, there is no mention of the seven Spirits revealed in the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation was written to seven churches with peace and grace from the seven Spirits (1:4). The seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire burning before God’s administrative throne (Rev. 4:5). This indicates that the seven Spirits are for God’s administration. The seven Spirits are also the seven eyes of the Lamb sent forth into the whole earth (5:6). The seven Spirits are revealed in this book, first for the seven churches, second for God’s administration, and third for Christ to be brought to all the earth. These are important matters, but there is not a word in the Nicene Creed about them.<p>We have been opposed because we have dropped the creeds and the traditions of men to take the entire Word of the Bible. Martin Luther was also greatly opposed by the Roman Catholic Church because he refused to go along with their traditions and councils. He stood for what the Bible said about justification by faith. We also must come back to the Word because the creeds are incomplete in their presentation of the divine revelation.<p>When the young people go to the campuses, they must know how to fight the battle because there is still strong opposition to the truth concerning the Spirit. If the opposers challenge you with the creeds, bring them to the Bible. You may say to them, “Do you know that Revelation 1:4 mentions not just one Spirit, but seven Spirits?” Check with them, “Do the creeds say anything about the life-giving Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45?” This is not just our teaching or interpretation. The Bible plainly says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. If the opposers believe in the Bible, the truth will vindicate you, and the pure Word will convince many of them.
