   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ's Divinity Being Incomplete</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the erroneous teaching of the Arians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They said that Christ's divinity is incomplete and that He came into being through the union of the Logos and the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, He cannot compare with God, but is merely all-excelling, being the most outstanding, the noblest, and the highest among the creatures for the Word is not God who is uncreated; rather, He is the chief of all creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Arius asserted that Christ was created by God, but was created before the ages, preceding all created things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, there was a time when He did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He further affirmed that because Christ died without sin, He could be resurrected, ascend to the heavens, and thus become God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first general council assembled at Nicea in A.D. 325 declared Arianism a heresy and rejected it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Under careful examination the false doctrine of the Arians is found to contain three points which are contrary to the revelation of the Scripture: 1 The Bible says clearly that the Word was God John 1:1 , yet Arius asserted that the Word is not the self-existent God and therefore maintained that Christ's divinity is imperfect and cannot compare with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is truly a great heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>2 The Scripture says that Christ is the very God who exists from the beginning John 1:1 and who is self-existent and without beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, the Arians said that there was a time when Christ did not exist and that He became God only after His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of teaching is also a great insult to Christ's Person!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>3 The Bible indeed says that Christ is the firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 , and also that Christ is the beginning of the creation of God Rev 3:14 , but it does not say that He was created before the ages, as was arbitrarily asserted by the Arians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In summary, they totally denied Christ's uncreated divinity and were too dogmatic concerning the time of Christ's becoming a created one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Justifiably, their teaching was pronounced a heresy and rejected by the general council at Nicea.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ's Humanity Being Incomplete</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the absurd teaching of the Apollinarians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They said that Christ's humanity is incomplete because He has the human body and human soul, but does not have the human spirit, which is mysteriously replaced by the Logos.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The so-called Christ is thus formed with these three: Logos, soul, and body unlike a normal human being which is made up of the spirit, soul, and body .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The second general council which assembled at Constantinople in A.D. 381 pronounced this doctrine a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of course, this doctrine greatly contradicts the revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the Bible says that Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18, 20 , having complete divinity, it also says that He was born of Mary Luke 2:5-7 , having perfect humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was born a child Isa 9:6 and grew up in a normal human way Luke 2:40, 52 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He not only possesses a human body Heb 2:14 and a human soul Matt 26:38 , but also a human spirit Mark 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the Scripture clearly reveals to us that Christ is a man complete with spirit, soul, and body and that He possesses perfect humanity as well.</S>
