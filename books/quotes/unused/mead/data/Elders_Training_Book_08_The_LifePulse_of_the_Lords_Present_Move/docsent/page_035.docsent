   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENJOYING GOD S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY TAKING CARE OF GOD S NEED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Train the saints who love the Lord so much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is regrettable that in the past they did not receive the adequate education or instruction in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The more they would spend for the Lord, the more they have the blessing spoken of in Philippians 4:19.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Give this verse to all the dear ones who love the Lord and are full-time to make money and to give.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse is a great blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Quite often when I receive a gift from a dear saint, I quote this verse as a conclusion to my letter of acknowledgment: My God shall fill every need of yours according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because you are taking care of God s need, God would give you a great blessing in filling every need of yours according to His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I have seen in the past that those who did care for God s need all received a bountiful blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The saints giving will not be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more they give, the more they will see the Lord s riches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Due to the good government, the good administration in Taiwan, the people there have become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to give the credit to our sovereign God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now all the saints there in Taiwan can share the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to pray that God would keep blessing the United States for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord s recovery needs much blessing that comes from God s sovereignty through the government.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The recovery needs the United States as its center.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Train the saints in your locality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not merely enjoy the physical gains you have received under God s sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This may offend the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this case the Lord will take back His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Train the saints to realize that if we are faithful to Him, He will bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we spend every ounce of our gold for His purpose, He will return to us not only by ounces, but by pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is to carry out the fellowship unto the gospel, the fellowship for the furtherance of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>USING THE UNRIGHTEOUS MAMMON</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>TO MAKE FRIENDS</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus taught us that while we are still in the stewardship, we should be wise to use the unrighteous mammon to make friends for the furtherance and spread of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only will you get back what you have given, but when the time comes when we will all enter into the eternal tabernacles, many will be there to welcome you Luke 16:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will have a great surprise, for you may never have realized that many have been brought to the Lord through your giving of the unrighteous mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you keep this money in your hand, it is all unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if you give it to the Lord, it all becomes useful, and you will make good friends of many.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is to fellowship unto the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE FELLOWSHIP UNTO THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Timothy 6:17 says, Charge those who are rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to set their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who affords us all things richly for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you trust in Him, you will receive more riches and also lay a good foundation for your future v. 19 . You must partake of the furtherance of God s move on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a great need of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many people are starving for the truth and many are under darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The light of the truth is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Who is going out to spread it?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need some full-timers who will drop their jobs, professions, and businesses to go out.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, they still need a living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we must have some faithful full-timers to do business, to make gold, to make money to support these ones who go out for the spreading of the kingdom, of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, when they go out, they take nothing from the Gentiles, the heathen 3 John 5-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You must help them to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They are the travelers for the spreading of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They need your support for the travel and for their living.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hope that in your training you may have some time to read and speak all these verses to the saints that their eyes may be opened to have a view, according to God s New Testament economy, of the world situation, their business, and their making of money.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then they will realize that they must not waste one cent, but save every penny for the giving to further the kingdom in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is to fellowship unto the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Philippians 4:15-16 says, And you yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the account of giving and receiving but you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What kind of sweet feeling the apostle expressed here!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He said this was a fragrant odor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God v. 18 . Paul did not seek a gift from them v. 17 , but what they gave became a sweet savor for Paul to put on the altar for them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It was not merely something to support him, but it became something increasing to their account.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is an account in the heavenly bank, in which we may have credit or debit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is merely a low practice to give ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is not a beggar; do not treat Him as one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You should honor Him as the very bountiful Giver who affords you all the riches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All your riches come from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It was and still is up to Him whether you will be rich or not.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not according to your plan of what you should do and have.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You simply must labor day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He then will follow your labor to bless you, not for your enterprise, but for the spreading of His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you keep money for your children, you will corrupt them and cause them to be corrupted by the money.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I do not mean that we should not take care of our children.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should simply take care of them within a limit and no more.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every parent should do something for his or her children, just as our Father does to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we would do nothing for our children, we are not representing our heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He takes care of us, but within a proper limit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We should follow our Father to take care of our children according to a limit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whether the Lord would give me billions of dollars or hundreds of dollars, I would simply take care of my children within a God-ordained limit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All the balance or remainder has to go to my heavenly account for God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All the saints need this kind of training.</S>
