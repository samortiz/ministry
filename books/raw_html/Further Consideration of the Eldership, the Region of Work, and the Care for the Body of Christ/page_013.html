<P>I am concerned that in the Lord's recovery, the brothers in a certain country may consider that the work there is their work. Then some brothers in another country may consider that the work there is their work. Thus, we have many works. This shows that our situation today is abnormal, yet probably not many of us have the sensation of abnormality in the recovery. There is a practical situation that is abnormal, and the biggest point of this abnormality is the different works.</P><P>I hope that we will consider our present situation before the Lord. Are we doing the same one work for the recovery? If not, we should let the Lord have the freedom to adjust us. Thank the Lord that due to the riches of the truth, the Lord's recovery is being welcomed everywhere on the earth. In the Lord's move in His recovery, there should only be one work, not different works. Our situation is different from this. We have different works without any consciousness. This is dangerous.</P><P>In Paul's time, because of the lack of modern transportation and communication, it would have been logical to have the work divided. However, there was only one work. Today the globe has been made small by modern conveniences. All the modern conveniences have made the globe just like a city. Despite this we do not have one work but many works. If we stay in this situation, a negative result may come out eventually. We do have an existing problem among us. I hope that we would reconsider our situation.</P><P>The two problems that are bothering me very much concern the eldership and the number of works. In the eldership all the brothers in the different age groups have to deal with the Lord concerning their pride, their thought of being a hero, and their opinions. The different works also need to be eliminated. As long as we have these two problems, the recovery cannot be that healthy or that prevailing. We must look to the Lord that these two things will be absent among us. Then I assure you that the recovery will be healthy and prevailing, and the increase surely will come. Furthermore, even in life, the standard, the level, will be greatly uplifted.</P>
