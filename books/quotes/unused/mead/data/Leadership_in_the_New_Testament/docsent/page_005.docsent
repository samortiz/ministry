   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE LEADERSHIP IN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTRY AND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AMONG THE NEW TESTAMENT MINISTERS Scripture Reading: Acts 1:17, 25; Eph 4:3-6; 1 Tim 1:3-4; 6:3-5; 2 John 9-11 ONE UNIQUE LEADERSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the New Testament there is only one ministry and only one leadership in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although there is the truth of the leadership in the New Testament ministry, the Lord did not officially appoint someone to be the leader.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The early part of Acts shows us that Peter was taking the lead among the apostles cf.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Acts 1:15; 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the Lord Jesus did not appoint Peter to be an official leader.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The leadership was something spontaneous according to life, according to the real need, and according to the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A leadership is shaped by the growth in life and is an issue of the need.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is no need, no leadership can be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The environment forms and constitutes the leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is one unique leadership since the ministry is one Acts 1:17, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because the ministry is one, there should never be more than one leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is also one unique leadership since God, the Lord, and the Spirit are all one Eph 4:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since there are one God, one Lord, and one Spirit, how could there be more than one leadership?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The one unique leadership is for keeping the oneness of the Spirit for the Body of Christ Eph 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today's Christianity is divided because there are too many leaderships.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every leader has a group which is the sphere of his leadership, and that sphere becomes a division.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, if the matter of leadership is not applied or viewed properly, it will create division.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE LEADERSHIP IN THE APOSTLES' TEACHING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The leadership is produced, strengthened, and also limited, restricted, in the apostles' teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1 Timothy 1:3-4 Paul charged Timothy to remain in Ephesus to do one thing with a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was there to charge the dissenting ones not to teach the things different from the economy of God in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He had to charge these ones not to teach things that were different from the apostles' teaching, which is concerning God's New Testament economy to dispense the processed Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people that Christ might have a Body to express Himself and that the Triune God might have a complete, eternal expression in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Any minister who preaches or teaches should carry out such a ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Otherwise, this preacher or this minister should be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul had the authority to charge people not to teach differently from God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Timothy was to tell these dissenting ones that their way of teaching had to be restricted and corrected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First Timothy shows us that there was some leadership that charged people to teach the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can also see the leadership in the apostles' teaching in 2 John 9-11 where John charges the believers not to receive those who go beyond the teaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To go beyond the teaching of Christ is to go beyond the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second John 10-11 says, "If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house, and do not say to him, Rejoice!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For he who says to him, Rejoice, shares in his evil works."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>John's charge prohibits the believers from receiving these kinds of ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To say "Rejoice" to someone was used for greeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The believers were not even to greet those who came to them and did not bring the teaching of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such a strong charge indicates the leadership in the New Testament ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul, in his work in the New Testament ministry, exercised leadership to correct those who taught wrongly, and John exercised his leadership to charge the believers not to receive those who taught heresy, which was not according to the teaching of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The apostles who participated in the ministry of the New Testament economy did exercise some leadership.</S>
