   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE ECONOMY OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>My burden in all the chapters of this book is to share with you something of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us read 1 Timothy chapter 1, verses 3 through 7: That you might charge certain ones not to teach different things nor to give heed to myths and unending genealogies, which produce questionings rather than God s economy, which is in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and out of a good conscience and out of unfeigned faith; from which things some, having misaimed, have turned aside to vain talking, desiring to be teachers of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These verses contain two very important expressions: God s economy and misaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The apostle Paul was chosen by God to bear the responsibility for God s economy, and he trained his spiritual son Timothy in this economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is quite interesting to note that Paul s Epistles to Timothy were written at a time when many Christians had drifted from the original pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They had missed the central mark of God s economy and were paying attention to something else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE DISTRACTIONS FROM GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to history, two prevailing elements distracted the early Christians from the right track: Judaism and Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both the Judaizers with their religious doctrines and forms and the Gnostics with their philosophies deterred the Christians from following the Lord in the pathway of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apparently, it was the good elements of Judaism and Gnosticism that sidetracked these early Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If these elements had not been comparatively good, they could never have been prevailing enough to cause the believers to miss the mark of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For instance, the Judaizers strongly stressed the Mosaic law of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There certainly was nothing wrong with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, it was unquestionably right and good and was given directly by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the law in itself was not related to the mark of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Gnosticism, from the human point of view, also had its good principles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In fact, it was one of the best inventions of human civilization and was somewhat a help to the heathen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Gnostics tried to bring their philosophy into the church, distracting the early Christians from the mark of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, even though there may be no Judaizers or Gnostics to disturb us, there is still much to distract us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For nearly twenty centuries the subtle one has never ceased using the seemingly good things to divert believers from following the Lord in the right track.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we spend time with the Lord, we will realize that the enemy is persistent in utilizing even the good things of Christianity to distract the Lord s children from the mark of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>While I was traveling through many districts in the United States during the last few years, I realized that many religious matters and even scriptural things have been used by the subtle enemy to influence seeking Christians to depart from the pathway of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE DEFINITION OF GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What is God s economy?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Scriptures, composed of sixty-six books, contain many different teachings, but if we would make a thorough and careful study of the Scriptures with spiritual insight, we would realize that God s economy is simply His plan to dispense Himself into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God s economy is God s dispensation, which means nothing other than God dispensing Himself into the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is regrettable that the term dispensation has been misused by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Its definition is nearly the same as the Greek word for economy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It means an administrative arrangement, a governmental management, and refers to the dispensing, distributing stewardship of God s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this divine dispensation God, who is almighty and all-inclusive, intends to dispense nothing other than Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This needs to be repeated many times in order to impress us deeply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God is exceedingly rich.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is like a successful businessman who has an enormous amount of capital.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God has a business in this universe, and His vast wealth is His capital.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not realize how many billions, countless billions, He has.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All this capital is simply Himself, and with it He intends to manufacture Himself in mass production.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God Himself is the Businessman, the capital, and the product.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His intention is to dispense Himself into many people in mass production and free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, God requires such a divine arrangement, a divine management, a divine dispensation, a divine economy, in order to bring Himself into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Let us be more specific.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now that we know that God s purpose is to dispense Himself into humanity, we must discover what God is in order to know what He is dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In other words, we need to know the substance of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When a businessman plans to manufacture a product, he must first of all be clear about the substance of the product, or its basic constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s substance is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The very essence of the almighty, all-inclusive, universal God is simply Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God is the Manufacturer, and He intends to reproduce Himself as the product; therefore, whatever He reproduces must be Spirit, the very substance of Himself.</S>
