   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the church is the assembly called out by God from the world, it should meet continually.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Meetings enable God's called out congregation to be supplied, established, and perfected, that the goal of God's calling this assembly may be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Meetings are actually the practical expression of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A local church without meetings is not a church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Meetings supply the saints with the Spirit, teach the saints with the Word, and keep the saints in the fellowship of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Meetings express the fullness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Meetings defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Meetings save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Meetings build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Meetings are crucial and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without the meetings, a church cannot go on and will not arrive at the goal of being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I. THE CHURCH MEETINGS ARE ORDAINED BY GOD FOR THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hebrew 10:25 says, "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together.''</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here the assembling of ourselves together refers to our Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has ordained the way in which every living thing in the universe should exist.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's ordination is the very law by which a particular living thing lives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the living thing obeys that law, it will survive and be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is the same towards us who have believed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's ordination for us, which becomes our law of existence and blessing, is the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As water is to the fish, and air to the birds, so are the meetings to the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As the fish must live in the water and the birds must exist in the air, so the Christians must maintain their spiritual existence and living by the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE BELIEVERS ARE A MEETING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every kind of life has its own characteristic, and usually, many characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The spiritual life we believers have received, being the life of God in us, also possesses many characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For example, the hatred for sin and the separation from sin are characteristics of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The desire to draw near to God and the willingness to serve Him are also its characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One of the many characteristics of our spiritual life is to flock together, to meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 10:3 and 16 show us that since we are saved, we are the Lord's sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The characteristic of the sheep's life is to flock together and to dislike isolation from the other sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, the Bible says that we are not only the Lord's sheep, but even more, His flock Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In order to be a sheep which shares in the blessing of the flock, we must meet together with the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The characteristic of the spiritual "sheep life'' within us requires this of us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE PURPOSE OF THE CHURCH MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The purpose of the church meetings is multifaceted.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First, the meetings are to remember the Lord and to worship the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord established His supper Luke 22:7-23 , He said that we should do this in remembrance of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After the supper they sang a hymn Matt 26:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to Hebrew 2:12, the Lord may have sung a hymn of praise to the Father with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Second, the church meetings are for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord said that the church has the authority to bind and to loose what has been bound and loosed in heaven Matt 16:19; 18:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates that the church should get together to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church began with prayer Acts 1:14 and continued in prayer Acts 2:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Third, the church meetings are for preaching the gospel to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The disciples preached the gospel in the temple and from house to house Acts 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fourth, the church meetings afford the believers an opportunity to care for one another in love 1 Thes 4:9 and to grow in life John 21:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Fifth, the meetings are for teaching the truth to perfect one another Acts 20:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Finally, the meetings are for building up the church 1 Cor 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After seeing the purpose of the church meetings, we should meet as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even meeting everyday is not too much.</S>
