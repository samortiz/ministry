<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. TWO LINES</H2><P>Every source has an issue. These two sources issue in two lines.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Two Lines Being the Two Ways</H2><P>Each line is also a way. Thus, the two lines are the two ways.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Two Lines, as the Two Ways,<br>Originating from the Two Sources</H2><P>The two lines, as the two ways, originate from the two sources.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The First Way Being the Way of Life</H2><P>The first way is the way of life, the constricted way (Matt. 7:14), the Way (Acts 9:2; 19:9, 23; 22:4; 24:22), the straight way (2 Pet. 2:15), the way of righteousness (2 Pet. 2:21), the way of salvation (Acts 16:17), the way of God (Matt. 22:16; Acts 18:26), and the way of the Lord (Acts 18:25), for men to seek God, to gain God, and to enjoy God in His eternal life as the supply and unto His eternal life as the goal, that they may be born of God in His life and nature (John 1:12-13), transformed and conformed into His glorious image (2 Cor. 3:18; Rom. 8:29), and glorified in Him as glory (Rom. 8:30; 1 Pet. 5:10a; Heb. 2:10a) to gain Him and participate in Him to the fullest extent. In this way of life are Abel, Seth, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Samuel, all the Old Testament prophets, and all the New Testament believers (Heb. 11:39-40). God's purpose in dealing with Job was to turn him from the way of good and evil to this way of life that he might gain God to the fullest extent.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Second Way<br>Being the Way of Good and Evil</H2><P>The second way is the way of good and evil, the way of death, the broad way (Matt. 7:13), for men to follow Satan to be his children (1 John 3:10a) unto death and his companions in his eternal perdition (Matt. 25:41). In this way of death and of good and evil are Cain, Lamech, Jabal, Jubal, Tubal-cain (Jude 11a; Gen. 4:16-24), Ham, Cush, Nimrod (Gen. 10:6-12), Korah, Balaam (2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11b), Saul, Absalom, Antichrist and his followers (Rev. 19:19-21), and all unbelievers (Rev. 20:15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. These Two Ways Leading<br>Men to the Two God-ordained Ends</H2><P>These two ways, the way of life and the way of death, lead men to the two God-ordained ends&#151;the New Jerusalem and the lake of fire&#151;respectively.</P>
