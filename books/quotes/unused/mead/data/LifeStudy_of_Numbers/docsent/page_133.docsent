   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Second Parable</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 23:13-26 we see Balaam's second parable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>a. Balak Bringing Balaam</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>to the Top of Pisgah, Building Seven Altars,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>and Offering a Bull and a Ram on Each Altar</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Balak said to him, Come with me to another place, from which you may see them; you shall see only the edge of them, and shall not see them all; then curse them for me from there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Balak brought Balaam to another place, a mountain, and, as in verses 1 and 2, built seven altars.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Balak and All the Rulers of Moab</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Standing beside Balaam's Burnt Offering,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>and Jehovah Putting a Word in Balaam's Mouth,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>and Balaam Prophesying in a Second Parable</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Again, Balak and all the rulers of Moab stood beside Balaam's burnt offering, and again Jehovah put a word in Balaam's mouth, and Balaam prophesied in a second parable vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>15-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One of the most striking lines in this parable is in verse 21: "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;/Nor has He seen trouble in Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How could Balaam speak such a word, since Israel was not perfect and since God could see all the iniquities of His people?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The answer is that this word was spoken not according to the human view but according to the divine view.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's view is different from our view.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we realize this, we will be careful whenever we speak of the defects of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to our view, a certain saint may have many defects, but according to God's view, this saint is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can we reconcile the word in verse 21 with the obvious fact that the children of Israel had many iniquities?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This apparent contradiction is reconciled by the fact that God's redeemed people have a twofold status: their status in themselves and their status in God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is our situation as believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In ourselves we have many defects, but in God's redemption and in Christ we have no defects.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When God looks at us, He does not see us according to what we are in ourselves but according to what we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God does not look at what His redeemed people are in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may even say that He has forgotten what we are in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our basis for saying this is that God has forgiven us, and when God forgives, He forgets Heb 8:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has put us all into Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Since He has put us into Christ, when He looks at us, He sees us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's view of us is that in Christ we do not have any iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The principle is the same with God's view of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to our view, the church life may be very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But according to God's view, the church life is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God has not beheld iniquity in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Numbers 23:21 says that God has not seen trouble in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Here the word trouble means hard things, evil things that cause people to be troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This kind of trouble is even worse than iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the sight of God, there was neither iniquity nor trouble in His people Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same principle, God does not see iniquity or trouble in the church life, because the church is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Christ we have been chosen, redeemed, and saved from the bondage of the fall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, according to God's view, we have been brought out of the fall, out of condemnation, and out of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we may say that in Christ the church life is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The first line in the chorus of a hymn on the church Hymns, #1221 speaks of the "glorious church life."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the church life is glorious only in Christ, I suggest that we add the words "in Christ" at the end of this line and sing, "Glorious church life in Christ!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may want to make a further adjustment and sing, "Glorious church life, in Christ but not in ourselves!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In ourselves the church life is not glorious, but in Christ the church life truly is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God surely had the standing to say that He did not behold iniquity in Jacob nor see trouble in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His people had been redeemed and forgiven; therefore, God could say that they were without iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Balaam, under the control and inspiration of God, had no choice except to declare that God did not behold iniquity or see trouble in the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Numbers 23:21 Balaam also said, "Jehovah their God is with them,/And the shout of a king is among them."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Who is this king?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I believe that, ultimately, this king refers to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, for the shout of a king to be among them means that the shout of Christ is among them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 22 speaks of God's bringing His people out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This verse also tells us that Israel "has as it were the horns of the wild ox."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 23 says that there is neither enchantment nor divination against Israel, for "it shall be said of Jacob/And of Israel, What God has wrought!"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Finally, in verse 24 the second parable concludes: "Behold, a people rises up as a lioness,/And lifts himself as a lion;/He shall not lie down till he devours the prey,/And drinks the blood of the slain."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The lioness, the lion, and the horns of the wild ox all refer to the fighting of the people of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Balak Speaking to Balaam</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After Balaam uttered his second parable, Balak said to him, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all" v. 25 . Here Balak was telling Balaam to be neutral concerning God's people.</S>
