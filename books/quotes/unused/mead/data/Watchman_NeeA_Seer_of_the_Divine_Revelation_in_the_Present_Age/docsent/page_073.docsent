   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Deviation of Christianity</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not long after they were saved, Watchman Nee and some other young believers who were still students began to realize, by studying the Bible, how abnormal Christianity is today.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord showed them that Christianity as it is practiced today has deviated in almost every point from the way God ordained in His holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>9.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Church, the Ecclesia, the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord gave Watchman Nee a clear revelation of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee preached and taught that the church is not a building, an organization, or a Christian mission.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church, rather, is an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a living body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In another sense, it is the ecclesia, the gathering together of the called-out ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>10.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Two Aspects of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Watchman Nee saw that the church is both universal and local.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the entire universe there is only one church, the church of God 1 Cor 10:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This unique church is expressed in many localities on earth, and in each locality it is a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The universal church is composed of all the local churches, and the local churches are the practical expression of the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Matthew 16:18, the universal church is revealed, whereas in Matthew 18:17, we see the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the local churches, there is no way to participate in the universal church, and there is no way to have a practical church life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the book of Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation, the church is expressed as local churches, i.e., the church in Jerusalem, the church in Antioch, the church in Ephesus, etc. The government of the church is not universal but local.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>11.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Denominationalism</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the same time he received revelation concerning the church, Watchman Nee also saw the evil of denominationalism.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Denominations divide the Body of Christ into many organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is condemned in the Scriptures 1 Cor 1:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>12.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Clergy System and Hierarchy</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Watchman Nee also received light concerning the clergy-laity system.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This system includes hierarchy, rank, and position in a form of Christianity which is reduced to human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Roman Catholic Church has priests, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Church of England has priests, bishops, archbishops, with the headship vested in the reigning sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Protestant churches have their pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This kind of clergy system is clearly contrary to the revelation of the New Testament and annuls the function of the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Denominationalism cuts the Body of Christ into pieces, and the clergy destroys the function of all its members.</S>
