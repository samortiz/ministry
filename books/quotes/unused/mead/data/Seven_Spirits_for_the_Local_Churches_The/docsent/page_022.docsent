   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT REVELATION BEING A BOOK OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Have you ever realized that Revelation is a book of life?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A good number of books have been written as expositions of this book, but most of them are written along the line of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the Lord has shown us that this is a book of life, not only of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Tree of life is mentioned four times in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Water of life is mentioned four times also, three times in the singular and once in the plural.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Book of life is used three times, and crown of life is also mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus also declared in this book, I am...the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever 1:17-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Revelation, as the last book of the Bible, is a book of life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is because in the very beginning of the Bible, the central theme is also life Gen 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A RECORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The record of God s creation in Genesis 1 2, strictly speaking, is not a record of creation but a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If it were really a record of creation, it would not be so short.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only one verse is the record of creation, and that is the first verse of chapter 1: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the record of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then from Genesis 1:2 to the end of chapter 2, it is entirely a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>According to the Hebrew text, Genesis 1:2 must be rendered in this way: But the earth became waste and emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the earth became waste and emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the earth became full of death, and upon the surface of the earth was the darkness of the deep.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The deep and the darkness signify death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit of God then came in, not to create but to recover by life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Following the coming of the Spirit of God, light came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The light was not for creation but for life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Light came in to separate the darkness from the light.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was for producing life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The first day, light came in for the producing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then an expanse came in to separate the waters above from the waters beneath.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This again is for the producing of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The expanse is air.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Without air, life is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Light is for life, and air also is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This was the second day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the third day the land came out of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The third day means resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was the good land that came out of the water of death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the earth came out of the water on the third day, all kinds of life were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All life comes out of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because of higher life, there is the need of greater light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, on the fourth day the great light-bearers, the sun, the moon, and the stars came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the fifth day the higher animal life was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fish in the waters, the birds in the air, and the beasts of the field all of these animal lives were produced.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then on the sixth day the highest life among creatures was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the human life, the life which is according to the image of God, the highest of all lives.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now we can see that Genesis 1 is not a record of creation but a record of life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Genesis 2 continues by showing how God made man from the dust of the ground and placed him before the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By the side of the tree of life was another tree, the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man was made with the highest life among the created lives, but man still needs the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Genesis 2 gives us the details of how man was made and for what purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man was made in three parts the body, soul, and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The body is for contacting the physical world, the soul is our being, and the spirit is the part whereby we may contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are a person with a body without and a spirit within so that we may receive God into us as the divine life, and this divine life is signified by the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The highest life among all the created lives must receive God as the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we will be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we will receive the divine life, we will have the living water flowing within us as shown in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>By the tree of life, a river was flowing, and in the flow of the river, precious materials were produced: gold, bdellium pearl , and onyx precious stone .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These precious stones are for the purpose of producing a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Following this, there is a bride Eve to match the bridegroom Adam .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This bride, we know by Revelation 21, typifies the holy city built with these three kinds of precious materials: gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thus, this is not a record of creation but a record of life which produces material for the building up of the universal bride to match the universal Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is the opening of the sixty-six books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The first two chapters of the Bible are a record showing how life produces the materials to build up the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brothers and sisters, do we need teachings?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do we need doctrines?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Praise the Lord, we need life, and Christ is life, and Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God is in Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we read the Bible from Genesis 1 to the Gospel of John, we see that in Him Christ was life John 1:4 , and He says, I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He said again and again that He is life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He told Martha that He is life 11:25 , and He told His disciples that He is life 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He came that we may have life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Life is all we need.</S>
