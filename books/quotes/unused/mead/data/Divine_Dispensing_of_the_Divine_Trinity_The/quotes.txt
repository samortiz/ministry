[1]  AND ITS ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION Scripture Reading: Eph 1:10; 3:9; 1 Tim 1:4; 1 Cor 9:17; Eph 3:2; Col 1:25; 1 Cor 4:1; 1 Pet 4:10; Gen 1:26-27; 2:9-12, 22; Rev 21:1-3, 11, 18-22; 22:1-2 DEFINITION OF THE WORD DISPENSATION
[2]  We will not try to cover the entire theme of God s dispensation.
[3]  Our burden is to see God s original intention.
[4]  Now we come to the last two chapters of the Bible where we find the ultimate consummation of God s intention.
[5]  God s intention will have a consummation, which will be the New Jerusalem, the consummate tabernacle of God as His Bride Rev 21:2-3 , bearing His glorious image to express Him Rev 21:11 .
[6]  Today we need to contact the Triune God to be supplied and nourished with the divine life as the river of water of life and as the tree of life Rev 22:1-2 , that we might be transformed with the Father s golden nature through the Son s death and resurrection and by the work of God the Spirit.
[7]  IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PATRIARCHS Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15, 20, 21; 4:4, 26; 5:22, 24; 6:9, 14; 7:7; 12:1; 26:4; 28:12-14, 16-19; 32:28; 41:40-41
[8]  Prayer: Lord, how we thank You that You are the speaking God.
[9]  The first great landmark of the human race was Adam, who fell away from God.
[10]  We should not forget that he was the first generation of mankind.
[11]  He was the father of all of us, and he was made in the image of God.
[12]  God intended that Adam would take the divine life into himself, and that he would have the flowing of the river within him to be transformed into gold, bdellium, and onyx stone for the building up of a bride.
[13]  But he got fallen away from God, in other words he lost God.
[14]  How good it is that in Enoch there is a man walking with Elohim 5:22 .
[15]  Without the Son to redeem us, to be our Redeemer, how could sinful man walk with God?
[16]  Now we have to go on from Noah to this complete person composed with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob with Joseph.
[17]  With this complete person you can see more items.
[18]  OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL 1 Scripture Reading: Exo 12:3, 7b-8a, 8b; 13:6-7; 16:14-15; John 6:51; Exo 17:6; John 7:38-39; 1 Cor 15:45b; Exo 40:34-38; John 1:14; 1 Cor 12:12; Heb 9:2-5; Lev 1:1-2a
[19]  In the last message we saw something concerning God s dispensing in the book of Genesis.
[20]  After being redeemed he was brought back to God and into the divine fellowship with God 4:4 , and he suffered martyrdom for God s testimony 4:5-8 .
[21]  In this message we need to see how God could reach such a point in His dispensing.
[22]  First of all the people of Israel got saved by the Lamb of God who typified the redeeming Christ Exo 12:3 .
[23]  Don t forget that the Lord Jesus Christ is the very embodiment of God.
[24]  The Lamb of God is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[25]  After the children of Israel got into the wilderness, they ate manna Exo 16:14-15; John 6:51 .
[26]  Manna was a kind of heavenly food which rained from heaven.
[27]  In the past two messages we have seen the central view of the divine dispensation in the books of Genesis and Exodus.
[28]  The book of Psalms is mainly a book of the enjoyment of the temple.
[29]  In the Old Testament God's dispensing in His dispensation consummated in the temple.
[30]  The glory, the leading, and the divine riches were the result of God dispensing Himself into His people.
[31]  Now we want to come to the New Testament and see the central view concerning God s dispensing Himself into us.
[32]  IN THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: John 12:24; 3:15; 10:10b; 2:19, 21; 1 Pet 1:3; John 3:29; 14:16-20; 17:21-23; 20:22; 14:23, 26; 15:4a, 5a; 7:38-39; Rev 22:1-2
[33]  The ministry of Christ is the main ministry in the New Testament to dispense God into us.
[34]  It is clearly of two parts: the first part is for Him to come to us, and the second part is for Him to go back to God.
[35]  The first thing that the Lord Jesus does in resurrection is that He imparts His divine life into the believers John 12:24; 3:15; 10:10b .
[36]  Resurrection dispenses Him as life into His believers to make them His members.
[37]  It is by God s dispensing in the resurrection of Jesus Christ that He obtains a Bride, a wife, composed of all the regenerated ones.
[38]  The issue of regeneration in John 3 is a Bride to Christ v. 29 . Christ gained a Bride through God s dispensing.
[39]  Regeneration in Christ s resurrection is just God dispensing Himself into you, and this dispensing issues in a Bride to Christ.
[40]  Then Christ in His resurrection brought all His believers into God John 14:16-20; 17:21 .
[41]  This is not a doctrinal Christ nor merely a historical Christ, but the present Christ, the practical Christ, the very living Christ who is the embodiment of God dispensing Himself into our entire being by abiding in us with the Father through the Spirit.
[42]  God s dispensation in the ministry of Christ is also to mingle the believers with the Triune God John 17:21-23 .
[43]  For example, when you put a tea bag into a glass of water, sometimes you help it by mixing it up.
[44]  IN THE MINISTRY OF PAUL 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:2; Rom 9:5; Heb 1:8, 10; 2 Cor 4:5; Rom 10:12; Eph 4:5; Rom 8:3, 32; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; Col 2:9; Heb 1:3; Col 1:15; Titus 2:13; Heb 4:14; 7:26
[45]  Paul has presented us many items of what Christ is.
[46]  Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .
[47]  We are all runners, running from all the things outside of God.
[48]  He was the forerunner, running from anything other than God into God.
[49]  Christ is the Mediator between God and us, and He is also the Mediator of the new covenant, the new contract Heb 8:6; 9:15; 12:24 .
[50]  This means that Christ is like an attorney who is always pleading our case before God.
[51]  The Lord Jesus always wins our case before God.
[52]  Our Lord Jesus is our food, our drink, and our clothing 1 Cor 10:3-4; Gal 3:27 .
[53]  Second Corinthians 11:2 reads, For I am jealous over you with a jealousy of God; for I betrothed you to one husband, to present a pure virgin to Christ.
[54]  He is our husband so that He might dispense all the riches of God which are embodied in Him Col 2:9 into our being.
[55]  As the last Adam, Christ on the one hand terminated the old man, and on the other hand, He became the life-giving Spirit so that God could be dispensed into us to be our life that we may be God s new creation.
[56]  Prayer: Lord, how we worship You as the speaking and dispensing God!
[57]  In order for God to dispense Himself into us, Christ is many items.
[58]  Of those thirty-four items, one item is very significant, that is, Christ is the firstborn Son of God.
[59]  I was a Christian for a number of years before I understood and paid attention to the fact that first Christ was the only begotten Son of God, and that He became the firstborn Son of God.
[60]  When Christ is ministered and the church is produced, they two become the corporate Christ.
[61]  The church itself is the fullness of Christ, the expression of Christ Eph 1:23 ; whereas the corporate Christ, that is, the individual Christ with the church as His Body, is the fullness of God, the expression of God Eph 3:19 .
[62]  First the church is the fullness of Christ, then Christ and the church become the fullness of God.
[63]  God is manifested in such a corporate Christ who is the new man Eph 2:15; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11 .
[64]  This new man has Christ as his Head and the church as his Body, as a universal man for God s expression and satisfaction.
[65]  This indicates that according to Peter s understanding the Spirit of God in the New Testament age has become the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of glory.
[66]  Now let us consider the aspects of Christ ministered by Peter for the dispensing of God into us.
[67]  First of all Peter also ministered Christ as God.
[68]  Second Peter 1:1 has the phrase, In the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ.
[69]  This indicates that Jesus Christ our Savior is God.
[70]  According to Peter, Christ is a lamb without blemish and spot 1 Pet 1:19 .
[71]  Furthermore, Christ s redemption according to 1 Peter 1:18 is not just to redeem us from sin or from hell, but to redeem us from our vain manner of life.
[72]  Jude was surely a brother under God s dispensing.
[73]  In Jude there is the matter of building up ourselves in the most holy faith v. 20 . What is faith? It is just the impartation of Christ into us.
[74]  Eventually this is unto eternal life and will set us before His glory without blemish in exultation v. 24 . To be built up in the faith, to pray in the Holy Spirit, to keep ourselves in the love of God, to await the Lord s mercy, is altogether unto eternal life so that we may be set before God s glory.
[75]  IN THE MINISTRY OF JOHN Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 1 John 1:1; Rev 19:13; John 1:18; 3:15-16; 1:34; 20:31; 1 John 1:2; John 11:25; 14:6; 3:34; 1:51; Rev 1:13; John 1:29; Rev 5:6; 13:8; 22:1-2; 1 John 2:1-2; Rev 2:8; 22:13; 3:14; 1:18; 3:7; John 3:36; 1 John 5:12-13, 20; 1:3-7; 2:6, 20, 27; 3:9; 2:29; 4:7; 5:1, 4, 16-21; Rev 1:9-12, 20; 14:1-5, 15-16; John 3:29; Rev 19:7-9; 21:2-3, 9, 11, 18-21; 22:14, 17
[76]  The subject of John s writings is the Triune God dispensing Himself into His chosen people as the life and life supply to make them all divine to express Him in full for eternity.
[77]  The reality, the center, and the content of the entire universe is just that the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit wants to dispense Himself into His chosen people as their life and life supply to make them divine to express Him in full and for eternity.
[78]  Both Paul and Peter also ministered in this way, pointing out that Christ, the Son of God, is God Himself Rom 9:5; Heb 1:8; 2 Pet 1:1 .
[79]  Our Christ is the Son of Man John 1:51; Rev 1:13 .
[80]  Christ is not only the Son of God with the divine nature, but also the Son of Man with the human nature.
[81]  He is the Son of Man for redemption, to take away our sin and solve the problems between us and God, that God might be dispensed into us.
[82]  God does not have blood to shed for our redemption, nor does the Son of God have blood, but the Lamb, the Son of Man, has blood.
[83]  In John s writing he touches the divine things.
[84]  With the divine things there is no beginning and no ending because whatever is divine is eternal, having no beginning and no ending.
[85]  The issue of Christ ministered is that many have been born of God.
[86]  Such a corporate entity is built with God the Father s nature, signified by the gold, by God the Son s overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, signified by the pearls, and by God the Spirit s work of transformation, signified by the precious stones Rev 21:11, 18-21 .
[87]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE DISPENSING OF THE FATHER Scripture Reading: John 7:29; 16:27b; 5:24, 30, 36-38, 43; 4:34; 13:20; 14:24; 1:29; 3:14; Rom 8:3; 1 John 4:10, 9; John 16:32; 8:29; 6:46; 17:8; 14:10-11; 16:15a; Col 2:9; John 3:16; 14:23; 1 John 3:24; 4:13
[88]  The Gospel of John is a divine writing, and because it is divine, it is mysterious.
[89]  When we read the Gospel of John, it is easy to pick up many shallow things, things on the surface, but it is not easy to get into the depths to reach the divine reality.
[90]  In chapter one, verse 1 God is revealed: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
[91]  According to the Bible, God is reality, the Son of God is reality, the Spirit of God is reality, the Word of God is reality, the entire Bible in its content is reality, and even our belief which we hold is a reality.
[92]  The Father is the very source, the initiator, because the Son came out from Him John 7:29; 16:27b .
[93]  In John 16:27 the Lord Jesus said, You have loved Me and have believed that I came out from God.
[94]  We do not have the ability to explain this.
[95]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE DISPENSING OF THE SON Scripture Reading: John 1:18; Heb 1:3; John 5:43; 1:14; 16:4b; 14:10, 11a; 17:21; 10:30; 17:22; 6:57a; 10:25; 5:17, 19; 6:38; 5:30; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50; 7:18; 14:7-9; 15:26; 16:7; 3:34; 20:19-23; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; John 14:16-20, 23; 17:23, 26
[96]  In it we cannot find that the Lord had any intention merely to teach us what to do or what not to do.
[97]  The story of the Samaritan woman in chapter four shows that even our worship to God may veil us from knowing and seeing the real God.
[98]  The source and the expression are not two things, but one thing with two aspects.
[99]  In the Gospel of John we are told that in eternity past the Son and the Father coexisted, because the Word was with God John 1:1 .
[100]  This is the dispensing of the Triune God into us to produce many children of God and many brothers of Christ, so that the Father may have a house, that Christ may have a Body, and that the Spirit may have an organism to express the Triune God.
[101]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE DISPENSING OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 14:17; 20:22; 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:14-15; 14:23; Rom 8:9-11; John 7:38-39
[102]  The first two verses of the Gospel of John mention God, but they do not mention the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in clear words.
[103]  Then in the following chapters the mystery of the Father is gradually disclosed.
[104]  The Father is the source, the initiator, the Son is the expression, the accomplisher, and the Spirit is the entering in, the applier John 14:17 .
[105]  The Son sent the Spirit John 16:7 , and the Spirit came from with the Father John 15:26 in the name of the Son John 14:26 .
[106]  By this you can see that the Father by Himself cannot reach us, nor can the Son by Himself enter into us.
[107]  Paraclete is the anglicized form of the Greek word paracletos.
[108]  The Spirit abides with the Son and the Father in the believers John 14:17, 23; Rom 8:9-11 .
[109]  This is why in our study of the holy Word concerning the Trinity we have picked up point after point which give us a clear view that first, the Son comes in the Father s name, and the Spirit is sent in the Son s name and second, that the Son comes with the Father, and the Spirit comes with the Father and the Son.
[110]  OF THE DIVINE DISPENSING Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2; Heb 1:8; Acts 5:3-4; John 4:24; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 19:7-9; 21:2, 9, 11, 18-21; 22:1-2, 14, 17
[111]  First Peter 1:2 tells us that the Father is God; Hebrews 1:8 tells us that the Son is God; and Acts 5:3-4 tells us that the Spirit is God.
[112]  But if you read even only the Gospel of John carefully, getting into the depth of the truth, you will see that the Son came in the Father s name, He worked out the Father s will, He worked the Father s work with the Father and in the Father s name, He spoke the Father s word, and He sought the Father s glory.
[113]  In the Gospel of John it may seem that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three separate persons.
[114]  Revelation 1:4 speaks of the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and 4:5 speaks of the seven Spirits of God.
[115]  Eventually this consummation will come to the ultimate stage, the New Jerusalem.
[116]  The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God dispensed into His redeemed people will be there as the Bridegroom; and God s redeemed people as the consummation of the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed humanity will be there as the bride.
[117]  Chapter one tells us that the church, the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, is the issue of God s dispensing Himself into His believers.
[118]  For the dispensing of the Divine Trinity the Father first selected us.
[119]  We were selected not only before we were born, but even before the foundation of the world v. 4 . In eternity, before time began, God the Father selected us.
[120]  Following His selection, God predestinated us unto sonship v. 5 . This means He destined beforehand that we may be His sons.
[121]  The Spirit s dispensing is His sealing unto the redemption of the acquired possession to the praise of His glory vv.
[122]  The seal of the Holy Spirit is living, and it works within us to permeate and transform us with God s element until we are matured in God s life and eventually fully redeemed even in our body.
[123]  The issue of the threefold dispensing of the Triune God is through our spirit of revelation v. 17 and by the exceeding greatness of His power toward us v. 19 . This great power is according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead v. 20 , that is, in resurrection; in seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies far above all vv.
[124]  20b-21 , that is, in ascension; in subjecting all things under His feet v. 22a , that is, making Him above everything; and in giving Him to be Head over all things to the church v. 22b . Such a power has been applied to us, and the application of this power is the life-dispensing.
[125]  It is by the life-dispensing of the Triune God that such a power, even a power of surpassing greatness, has been applied to all of us.
[126]  When the Triune God dispenses Himself into us, this life-dispensing saturates our entire being and causes us to become regenerated, transformed, and even transparent members of Christ.
[127]  Ephesians 1 reveals that God selected us and predestinated us with a view to dispense Himself into us as life and life supply by sonship, that is, by life-dispensing, and by the sealing of the Spirit.
[128]  God wants to saturate us with His life-dispensing so that we may be an organism, the Body of Christ, as the enlargement, the fullness, of the One who fills all in all.
[129]  Before God began to dispense Himself into His chosen ones, we became fallen not only into sin, but also into death v. 1 . Within the realm of death in offenses and sins we walked first according to the age of this world, that is, according to the current, the tide, of the world v. 2 . It is not difficult to understand what is the current, the tide, of the age.
[130]  THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY The Father s Rich Mercy and Great Love
[131]  Because God loved His chosen people with a noble, high, and great love, He would not give them up.
[132]  Within His love there are the riches of His mercy.
[133]  We were fallen into sin and into death and even were walking in the realm of sin and death, but God came to enliven us, to raise us up from the dead, and to exalt us and seat us in the heavens.
[134]  When Christ preaches such a gospel by Himself as the life-giving Spirit, and when we hear and accept such a gospel, what do we receive?
[135]  The main thing we receive is the life-giving Spirit.
[136]  In the first message of this series we saw that chapter one of Ephesians reveals the plan of God the Father.
[137]  In the second message we saw that chapter two reveals mainly the Son s accomplishment to dispense the Trinity into our being so that we may grow into the dwelling place of God.
[138]  In this message we come to chapter three where we have the dispensation of God s grace.
[139]  In God s plan, His dispensation, the main thing is the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.
[140]  The dispensing in chapter three of Ephesians is deeper and more intimate than that in chapter one.
[141]  When we are strengthened into our inner man, Christ can make His home in our heart vv.
[142]  For Christ to make His home in our heart is a great matter.
[143]  Both grace and truth are covered in chapter four of Ephesians.
[144]  In chapter one of the Gospel of John grace and truth are also mentioned.
[145]  The Word was God, and the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace and truth John 1:1, 14 .
[146]  Ephesians 4 is on the Body of Christ as the development of the Triune God.
[147]  The Body is mingled with the Triune God because with the Body the Trinity is mentioned in a detailed way.
[148]  When Paul speaks of the one God and Father of all in verse 6, he says that the Father is over all, through all, and in all.
[149]  Although chapter four of Ephesians covers many matters, the crucial matters revealed in this chapter are the Body, the mingling with the Triune God, life, grace, and truth or reality.
[150]  This chapter reveals that the Body is mingled with the Divine Trinity.
[151]  Every member of the Body, whether small or large, has received something of the Triune God as supply, as grace ministered to that member.
[152]  Large members, such as Peter and Paul, could minister the riches of Christ into all the churches.
[153]  THE PROPER CHRISTIAN LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 5:1 6:9
[154]  Ephesians 5 opens with these words: Become therefore imitators of God, as beloved children; and walk in love... vv.
[155]  Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity we all need to be filled in our spirit with the Spirit as the divine wine v. 18 . If we are filled in our spirit in this way, then we shall speak to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs v. 19a , we shall be singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord v. 19b , and we shall be giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and the Father v. 20 . When we have the Triune God dispensed into us thoroughly to make us children of light walking in love, we shall be able to declare, This is my story, this is my song, praising my Savior all the day long.
[156]  The issue of the divine dispensing is that we can be in subjection to one another in the fear of Christ v. 21 for the proper Christian life.
[157]  Verse 21 says, Being subject to one another in the fear of Christ.
[158]  This is a continuation of the preceding verses, which speak of being filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord, and giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God and our Father.
[159]  It is only when we are drunk with God that we are willing to subject ourselves to others.
[160]  Instead of being filled with wrath, anger, or indignation, we should be filled with all that God is, filled even to the fullness of God.
[161]  When our spirit is filled with the Triune God who has been dispensed into us, we shall be drunken, not in our body, but in our spirit, not in our outward man, but in our inward man.
[162]  FIGHTING THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE Scripture Reading: Eph 6:10-24
[163]  Therefore, by the time we come to chapter five, Christ is expressed through His Body, God s purpose is fulfilled through the new man, and Christ is satisfied with the Bride.
[164]  In order to fight the battle for God s kingdom and defeat His enemy, we need power.
[165]  Ephesians 6:15 says, And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace.
[166]  THE SUBJECTIVE SALVATION OF GOD Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10, 17; 8:2-3, 6, 9-11, 14-16, 29-30
[167]  In 8:2 Paul says, For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.
[168]  The life in 8:2 is the saving life in 5:10 and the reigning life in 5:17.
[169]  As we go on to verse 11, we see that it is also possible for life, the divine, eternal life, to be given to our mortal body.
[170]  In this verse Paul says that if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will give life to our mortal bodies, and this will take place through the indwelling Spirit.
[171]  When we put together verses 10, 6, and 11, we see that not only is our spirit life, and our mind life if it is set on the spirit, but life may also be given to our mortal bodies through the Spirit.
[172]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10-17; 8:2-3, 6, 9-11, 14-16, 29-30
[173]  Although the word dispensing is not used in this book, the fact of the divine dispensing is nonetheless found in this Epistle.
[174]  According to the divine fact, when we believed in the Lord Jesus, He, the very embodiment of the Triune God, came as the Spirit into our spirit.
[175]  Hence, Christ is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God.
[176]  But in the Lord s recovery we care not only for the proper understanding of the Word of God, but we care also for the subjective experience of Christ.
[177]  What we are speaking about is not anything superstitious.
[178]  Through redemption and by regeneration, we have the Triune God living in our spirit.
[179]  As we breathe in air to maintain our physical life, we simply need to breathe in the Triune God in order to experience His dispensing.
[180]  Praise the Lord that the life-giving Spirit is now moving in us, acting in us, and anointing us!
[181]  As coat after coat of paint is applied to a chair, so through the anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit the divine element with the divine essence is applied to us.
[182]  The Spirit within us is continually anointing us, continually painting us with the divine paint, the divine essence.
[183]  We have seen that in this chapter we have the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[184]  In this chapter we also have the process through which the Triune God has passed for the purpose of dispensing Himself into us as life and as our life supply.
[185]  Because of the influence of modern scientific studies, it is not difficult for us to understand what a natural law is.
[186]  For example, we may speak of the law of digestion.
[187]  Then in chapter five of his Epistle John says, Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God v. 1 ; Everything that has been begotten of God overcomes the world v. 4 ; and Everyone who has been begotten of God does not sin, but he who is begotten of God keeps himself v. 18 . From these verses we can see clearly that we who believe in Christ have been born of God.
[188]  Because the highest law, the law of the divine life, is operating within us, there is no need for us to strive to overcome negative things.
[189]  Instead of striving, we should simply allow the law of life to work within us.
[190]  However, we need to see that this law works only as the divine life grows.
[191]  Paul speaks of a second divine provision in 8:14: For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.
[192]  In this verse we have the leading of the Spirit.
[193]  Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.
[194]  There is a Witness within us who testifies that we are children of God.
[195]  This means that within us Someone is reminding us that we are children of God.
[196]  AND ITS ISSUE THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Rom 8:4-6, 13; 12:1-2, 5, 11; 16:1, 5a, 16b, 20 WALKING ACCORDING TO SPIRIT
[197]  In Romans 8:4 Paul says, That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.
[198]  If we walk according to spirit and set our mind upon the spirit, then spontaneously we shall by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body.
[199]  Concerning this, Paul says, For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live v. 13 . If we live, walk, and have our being according to spirit and set our mind on the spirit, then continually we shall by the Spirit put to death all the practices of the body.
[200]  Then we shall be absolutely under the divine dispensing, and we shall participate in this rich dispensing and enjoy it.
[201]  Furthermore, if we walk according to spirit, set our mind on the spirit, and put to death the activities of the body by the Spirit, we shall automatically be in the Body in a practical way.
[202]  In both 8:6 and 12:2 Paul speaks concerning the mind.
[203]  THE PRACTICAL LIFE IN A LOCAL CHURCH 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:2, 24, 30; 2:7, 9-10, 12; 3:16; 6:11b
[204]  I do not believe that throughout the centuries many Christians have realized that the existence of the church depends on the divine dispensing.
[205]  In the foregoing message we began to consider Paul s word in 1 Corinthians 1:2: To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, theirs and ours.
[206]  We have seen that for the church to be of God means not only that the church belongs to God, but also that the church comes out from God as the source.
[207]  Christ is the element and sphere that separated us unto God, made us holy unto Him, when we believed in Him, that is, when we were brought into an organic union with Him through our faith in Him.
[208]  When I was young I could not understand how Paul could say that the Corinthians were called saints.
[209]  The condition of the church in Corinth was poor, and this book describes the negative things that were among the Corinthians.
[210]  In 6:11 Paul says, And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
[211]  In previous messages we have seen that the church is God s poem, His masterpiece Eph 2:10 , and that the existence of the church comes through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.
[212]  The church is produced of God as the source 1 Cor 1:2a , the church is sanctified in Christ as the sphere and element 1:2b , and the church is sanctified by the Spirit as the application with the divine nature 6:11b .
[213]  In 2:7 Paul says, But we speak God s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.
[214]  The glory here is Christ, who is the Lord of glory v. 8 . Christ is our life today Col 3:4 and will be our glory in the future Col 1:27 . To this glory God has called us 1 Pet 5:10 , and into it He will bring us Heb 2:10 . This is the goal of God s salvation.
[215]  Having Called Us into the Fellowship of His Son
[216]  In 1:9 Paul says, God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[217]  This fellowship is the partaking of God s Son, the participation in Him.
[218]  To be in this fellowship is to partake of the all-inclusive Christ, to participate in Him.
[219]  God has called us into such a fellowship so that we may partake of Christ and enjoy Him as our God-given portion.
[220]  To be called into the fellowship of God s Son actually means to be called into the participation and enjoyment of Christ.
[221]  According to 1:24, Christ is also wisdom to us from God.
[222]  Furthermore, in 1:30 Paul says, But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[223]  Here we see that Christ has been made wisdom to us from God as three vital matters in God s salvation: righteousness for our past , by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life; sanctification for our present , by which we are being sanctified in our soul with His divine life; and redemption for our future , that is, the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 , by which we shall be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness Phil 3:21 .
[224]  In 3:16 we see that the Spirit dwells in the church: Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
[225]  In this verse a temple of God refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, as in Corinth.
[226]  The dwelling of the Spirit of God in the church is also a matter of the divine dispensing.
[227]  In 3:6 Paul says, I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.
[228]  At the end of chapter seven, a long chapter concerned with married life, Paul says, I think that I also have the Spirit of God v. 40 . In the previous chapter Paul said that he was one spirit with the Lord.
[229]  But in 7:40 he says, I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
[230]  In the remainder of this message and in the two following messages, we shall give our attention to four matters seen in 1 Corinthians: birth, growth, transformation, and identification.
[231]  First we have the birth of the members of the church and then the growth and transformation of these members.
[232]  Growth is through the planting and watering of God s fellow-workers 3:8-9 and with the essence of God, who gives the growth 3:6-7 .
[233]  The church, the house of God, must be built with gold, silver, and precious stones, materials produced from Christ growing in us.
[234]  However, there is much possibility that we may build with wood, grass, and stubble produced by us in the flesh.
[235]  In this message we have emphasized the need for growth and transformation.
[236]  The only way to grow and be transformed is to have the dispensing of the Divine Trinity into our being.
[237]  Only God Himself can flow in our being to bring in His divine essence to produce the growth in life.
[238]  We should not think that only the Spirit of God is Spirit and that the Father and the Son are not Spirit.
[239]  It would be ridiculous to say that only one third of God is Spirit and that the other two thirds are not Spirit.
[240]  If we admit that the word spoken by the Lord Jesus in John 4:24 means that the entire God is Spirit, then we must also admit that the Father and the Son, and not only the Spirit, are Spirit.
[241]  In this message we have covered three crucial points: first, that the entire God is Spirit; second, that the Triune God reaches us as the Spirit; and third, that through resurrection Christ, the last Adam, has become the life-giving Spirit.
[242]  The Father and the Son do not reach us directly.
[243]  When the Spirit reaches us, the Father and the Son also reach us, because the Three of the Godhead cannot be divided or separated.
[244]  The New Testament reveals that God is Spirit, that the Third of the Trinity is the Spirit reaching us with the Son and the Father, and that today the Lord is the Spirit.
[245]  In 12:3 Paul says, Wherefore I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.
[246]  We all are able to speak for the Lord in the meetings.
[247]  You should not think that a certain brother who has much experience in the Lord and much knowledge of the Word is able to speak, but you are not able to speak.
[248]  In 1 Corinthians 12:4 Paul goes on to say, But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit.
[249]  But here indicates a contrast between verses 3 and 4.
[250]  Verse 3 says when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say Lord Jesus, exalting Jesus as Lord.
[251]  We may also compare our regenerated spirit to a switch.
[252]  When the switch is turned on, electricity flows into the appliances and causes them to work.
[253]  The first manifestation of the Spirit listed by Paul is the word of wisdom, and the second is the word of knowledge.
[254]  The word of knowledge may be somewhat ordinary; it is not necessarily a word directly concerning Christ.
[255]  In 12:10 Paul speaks not only of operations of power, but also of prophecy, discerning of spirits, various kinds of tongues, and interpretation of tongues.
[256]  To prophesy is to speak for God and to speak forth God.
[257]  Foretelling is miraculous, but speaking for God and speaking forth God are not miraculous.
[258]  Although Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers is of more than nine items.
[259]  A number of items are not included in these nine.
[260]  The apostleship, helps, and administrations by the Spirit listed in verse 28, seeing visions and dreaming dreams by the Spirit as mentioned in Acts 2:17, the signs and wonders referred to in Hebrews 2:4, and three of the five miraculous acts prophesied in Mark 16:17-18 are not listed here.
[261]  All the rest, a word of wisdom like the word of the apostles , a word of knowledge like the word of the teachers , and speaking for God and speaking forth God in prophecy by the prophets, discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations are gifts developed by the growth in life 3:6-7 , as those listed in Romans 12:6-8, out of the inward, initial gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:7.
[262]  In 12:28 Paul says, And God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers; then works of power, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues.
[263]  First Corinthians 12:11 and 12 say, But the one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one individually as He purposes.
[264]  For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body being many are one body, so also is Christ.
[265]  The believers of Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into Christ, the death of Christ Rom 6:3 , the name the Person of the Triune God Matt 28:19 , and the Body of Christ.
[266]  In chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians we have all the functions of the members of the Body, and in chapter fourteen we see that the functions are for the building up of the church.
[267]  Then in chapter fifteen we have what we may call the basic factor.
[268]  This chapter does not speak of gifts or functions; however, it does reveal the basic factor of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.
[269]  Chapter two indicates that this dispensing takes place by the unveiling and communicating Spirit.
[270]  In 2:9 and 10 Paul speaks of the unveiling Spirit: But even as it is written, Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not come up in man s heart, how much God has prepared for those who love Him.
[271]  But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.
[272]  This extract includes God s calling us into the enjoyment of Christ, God s putting us into Christ, God s making Christ wisdom and power to us, and the Spirit s revealing and communicating to us the things concerning Christ.
[273]  We not only enjoy Him and not only have God s dispensing of Him into us as our power and wisdom so that we may have righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; we have actually been joined to the very Christ who is the life-giving Spirit with all the riches of resurrection.
[274]  In 15:3 and 4 Paul says, For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures; and that He was buried, and that He has been raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.
[275]  Here we have Christ s death for our sins, His burial, and His resurrection.
[276]  In resurrection Christ became the firstfruit, something full of life: But now Christ has been raised from among the dead, the firstfruit of those who have fallen asleep v. 20 . He was the first to be raised, and we shall follow Him.
[277]  In 1 Corinthians we see those who have been called by God into the enjoyment of His Son, who have been placed by God into Christ, who have Christ as wisdom and power, who have the indwelling Spirit unveiling and communicating the riches of Christ to them, who are experiencing God s dispensing for growth unto transformation, who are joined to Christ as one spirit, and who are triumphant over sin and death.
[278]  The Greek word rendered compassions also means mercies, pity, sympathy.
[279]  Such a title as the Father of compassions and the God of all encouragement is ascribed here to God because this Epistle is one of comfort and encouragement.
[280]  As indicated by the record in 2 Corinthians, while Paul and his co-workers were suffering for the sake of the gospel, the Triune God was dispensing Himself into them, and this dispensing became their comfort and encouragement.
[281]  Furthermore, through their experience of being encouraged through the divine dispensing, they had the riches with which to comfort others.
[282]  This was the reason Paul could say that they were able to encourage those who are in every affliction through the encouragement with which we ourselves are encouraged by God 1:4 .
[283]  In 1:19 and 20 Paul speaks concerning the unchanging Christ with God s promises in Him: For the Son of God, Christ Jesus, who was preached among you through us, through me and Sylvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes.
[284]  For whatever promises of God there are, in Him is the Yes; wherefore also through Him is the Amen to God, for glory through us.
[285]  God is faithful, never changing, especially in His promises concerning Christ, so that the word the apostles preached concerning Christ is likewise never changing, because the very Christ whom God promised in His faithful word and whom they preached in their gospel did not become yes and no, but in Him is yes.
[286]  Since the Christ whom they preached according to God s promises did not become yes and no, the word they preached concerning Him was not yes and no. Not only their preaching but also their living was according to what Christ is.
[287]  The apostles, who preached Christ according to God s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles preaching, are joined to Christ.
[288]  The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God s image signified by the seal, thus making us like God.
[289]  God s attaching us to Christ issues in three things: an anointing that imparts God s elements into us, a sealing that forms the divine elements into an impression to express God s image, and a pledging that gives us a foretaste as a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God.
[290]  The anointing, the sealing, and the pledging are all a matter of the divine dispensing.
[291]  The indwelling Spirit is doing the work of dispensing.
[292]  As we are anointed with the Spirit, we experience the dispensing of the Spirit into us.
[293]  Furthermore, the sealing and the pledging, which guarantees, assures, and cheers us, are also related to God s dispensing.
[294]  In 2:15 and 16 Paul goes on to say, For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing: to the one a savor from death unto death, to the other a savor from life unto life.
[295]  The apostles, being permeated with Christ, became a fragrance of Christ to God.
[296]  They were not merely a sweet savor produced by Christ, but Christ Himself was the savor being exhaled in their life and work to God, both in those who were being saved, as a savor from life to life, and in those who were perishing, as a savor from death unto death.
[297]  Only the captives of God in Christ, who are saturated with Christ by the Spirit, are sufficient and qualified for this 3:5-6 .
[298]  The first of these metaphors is that of captives in the train of Christ s victorious procession: But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and manifests through us the savor of the knowledge of Him in every place 2:14 .
[299]  In 3:2 and 3 Paul uses the metaphor of a letter: You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men; being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone, but in fleshy tablets of the heart.
[300]  Here we see that those under the ministry of the apostles are letters composed by the apostles.
[301]  These letters are composed with the Spirit of the living God, with the life-imparting and life-dispensing Spirit.
[302]  God s shining, which is God s dispensing, in our hearts 4:6 brings into us a treasure, the Christ of glory, who is the embodiment of God to be our life and our everything.
[303]  We have briefly considered five metaphors used by Paul in 2 Corinthians.
[304]  Now we need to consider what is the issue, the result, of the experience pictured by these metaphors.
[305]  We have received the divine life, and God s intention is to work this life into our entire being.
[306]  Now God is seeking to spread His life from our spirit, the center of our being, into our soul and even into our body.
[307]  The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, like a pen for writing, but is the very element, like the ink in writing, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ.
[308]  Our preaching of the gospel depends on how much we have experienced of the Lord and how much we have enjoyed Him.
[309]  If we have experienced and enjoyed the Lord to a considerable degree, we shall surely have a sufficient measure of life.
[310]  Then what we say to others concerning God, Christ, and salvation will not merely be a doctrine or theory.
[311]  On the contrary, through our speaking we shall infuse others with the elements of God, Christ, and salvation.
[312]  To infuse others with the elements of God, Christ, and salvation is to write Christ into their being with the divine Spirit as the spiritual ink.
[313]  The writing of living letters of Christ is a matter of both dispensing and constituting.
[314]  With respect to the one doing the writing, it is a matter of dispensing.
[315]  But with respect to the one being written upon, it is a matter of constituting, a constituting that takes place through the divine dispensing.
[316]  The Spirit in verse 6 is the Spirit of the living God, with whom the apostles minister Christ into the believers to make them His living letters.
[317]  The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, as a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the believers and apostles, making them ministers of a new covenant, the covenant of life.
[318]  The underlying thought in Paul s writing here is related to dispensing.
[319]  Thus far, in chapter three of 2 Corinthians, we have covered three matters: the letter of Christ ministered by the apostles, inscribed with the Spirit of the living God v. 3 ; God having made the apostles competent as ministers of a new covenant, ministers of the Spirit who gives life 3:6 ; and God having constituted the ministry of the Spirit in glory and of righteousness abounding in glory 3:8-9 . All these matters are related to the constitution of life and ministry.
[320]  The Lord Christ of verse 16 is the Spirit who pervades and animates the new covenant of which we are ministers v. 6 , and the ministration of which is with glory v. 8 . Compare Romans 8:9-11; John 14:16, 18 Vincent . Regarding the Lord being the Spirit, Alford says, The Lord of verse 16 is the Spirit,...which giveth life, verse six, meaning, the Lord , as here spoken of, Christ , is the Spirit , is identical with the Holy Spirit:...Christ, here, is the Spirit of Christ.
[321]  When we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done.
[322]  In other words, He dispenses these elements into us.
[323]  The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence.
[324]  In this chapter this Spirit is revealed as the inscribing Spirit v. 3 , the life-giving Spirit v. 6 , the ministering Spirit v. 8 , the freeing Spirit v. 17 , and the transforming Spirit v. 18 . Such an all-inclusive Spirit is crucial to the ministers of Christ and to their ministry for God s New Testament economy.
[325]  In this message we shall give a concluding word regarding the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity issuing in the maturity of life and constitution of ministry.
[326]  In 4:4 Paul, referring to those who are perishing v. 3 , says, In whom the god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelieving, so that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine in them.
[327]  In 4:6 Paul goes on to say, Because the God who said, Out of darkness light shall shine, is the One who shined in our hearts for the illumination of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.
[328]  In chapter four we have the light; in chapter three, the Spirit; and in chapter two, the incense vv.
[329]  These three the incense, the Spirit, and the light are all related to the divine dispensing.
[330]  In 5:17 Paul speaks of the new creation: So that if anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.
[331]  To be in Christ is to be one with Him in life and in nature.
[332]  The old creation does not have the divine life and nature, but the new creation, the believers born again of God, does have the divine life and the divine nature John 1:13; 3:15; 2 Pet 1:4 .
[333]  These Epistles reveal a wonderful divine matter: the Triune God dispensing His very essence into our tripartite being.
[334]  In 1 Corinthians 1:30 Paul says not only that God has put us into Christ, but that Christ has become wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.
[335]  We need to pay careful attention to Paul s expression.
[336]  Paul does not say that Christ was given to us as wisdom.
[337]  Instead, he says that Christ became wisdom to us from God.
[338]  We have the enjoyment of Christ, we have Christ as the sphere and element into which we have been placed by God, we have Christ becoming wisdom to us from God, and we have Christ being transmitted into us to be our living righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
[339]  In order to function in the church, we need the gifts.
[340]  God is the source of the gifts, and the transmitting agent of the gifts is the Spirit of God.
[341]  We see this in the case of Saul of Tarsus, who was opposed to Christ.
[342]  Actually, 4:6 is an explanation of verse 5, where Paul says, For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake.
[343]  The apostles preached Christ as Lord and themselves as the believers slaves because the very God who commanded light to shine out of darkness had shined in their hearts.
[344]  The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God, for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit with the divine virtues.
[345]  The love of God is the source of the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the transmission of the grace of Christ with the love of God.
[346]  We should not think that first we enjoy love, then we enjoy grace, and finally we enjoy fellowship.
[347]  While we enjoy the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God.
[348]  Just as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods but three aspects or persons of the one God, so love, grace, and fellowship are three aspects of one thing.
[349]  We may say that grace here is actually the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 to bring the processed God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection.
[350]  In 2 Corinthians 1 we have the Holy Spirit as the anointing Spirit, the sealing Spirit, and as the pledge in our hearts 1:21-22 .
[351]  Concerning these aspects of the Spirit, Paul says, But He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, who has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.
[352]  Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are automatically anointed with Him by God.
[353]  Because God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him.
[354]  The sealing of the Spirit is a mark that we are God s inheritance, and the pledging of the Spirit is a guarantee, an earnest, of God being our portion in Christ.
