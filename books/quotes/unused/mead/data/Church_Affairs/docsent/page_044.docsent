   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Apostles Not Dealing with</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matters Directly Concerned with a Local Church</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you are elders, you cannot administrate affairs of other local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are elders in Jerusalem, you cannot administrate affairs in Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the Bible elders are always local.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You cannot go beyond the sphere of your local church to go to another local church to administrate their affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you are an apostle, you should not directly administrate the affairs of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An apostle can deal with the local elders, but an apostle cannot deal directly with the affairs of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let me give you an example.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The work in Corinth was carried out by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Acts we see clearly that Paul went to Corinth and rendered them help.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I want you to see that the relationship between Paul and Corinth was close and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul wrote two letters to the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only did Paul go to Corinth himself; he even sent others to Corinth, such as Timothy and Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul did all these things, but there was no way for him to cast out the sinner in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul was an apostle, but he was not an elder in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul could not post an announcement saying that since this one had committed sin, he would remove him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul had to say to the church in Corinth, Remove the evil man from among yourselves 1 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul had no way to remove this man for them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why was this?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul was an apostle, not an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible Paul did not tell us that he was an elder in a certain locality.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, Paul was an apostle to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He could not administrate a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The apostle could not directly handle the administration of a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The elders can administrate the church in their own locality but not those in other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The apostles can administrate the work of the region, but they cannot directly handle the local administration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The affairs of Corinth had to be handled by the Corinthians, not by Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As an apostle, how did Paul deal with the situation in Corinth?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said, In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus, to deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you work, you can only use spiritual authority to deliver such a one to Satan, but you have no way to remove him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the Corinthians would not remove him, Paul had no way to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not sure if you have seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the arrangement regarding the church in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Peter Having to Bear Two Responsibilities</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Jerusalem, a local church at the center of the work, Peter had to bear two responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He had to be in Jerusalem taking care of the work in that area, and at the same time, he was also an elder in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If he had not been an elder in Jerusalem, then he would have had no way to directly administrate the affairs of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Peter and John were elders in Jerusalem, and James was also an elder in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not have the complete assurance to say that all the apostles who lived in Jerusalem were always elders in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Probably, those whose names were mentioned were all elders in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter had to administrate the affairs in Samaria; therefore, Peter was also an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He took care of the work in that area based on his status as an apostle and administrated the church in Jerusalem based on his status as an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This matter is very clear in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the many co-workers in the local church at a center of the work today need to be responsible for the work on the one hand, and they may need to be elders on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You are elders, and at the same time, you may also be apostles, administrating the work in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope you can see the relationship between these two responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day when Antioch had a problem, they sent some to Jerusalem to inquire about this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When all the brothers in Jerusalem decided to send a letter, they could say to the saints that the apostles and the elders in Jerusalem had made such a decision.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As far as the apostles were concerned, this was a regional matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As far as the elders in Jerusalem were concerned, this was a matter of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The decision was made with apostles and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The apostles and elders decided this matter together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I do not know if you have seen this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I feel this is a beautiful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You need to know that in the aspect of the spiritual work of the church, there is not much room left for your imagination, nor much for you to add.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has put this in front of us in a very detailed way: It is the apostles who administrate the work, and it is the elders who administrate the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Peter bore both responsibilities at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Some Apostles Not Being Elders</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I still need to point out that there were apostles, such as Paul and Barnabas, who were not elders.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>According to our understanding, after careful study we cannot find any place in the Bible that tells us that Paul was also an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In the church in Antioch, Paul and Barnabas had a part only in the ministry of the word, not in the church affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They had a part in the ministry, but they were neither deacons nor elders; they did not hold these offices.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They were prophets in Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, Paul and Barnabas, the two apostles in Antioch, were in the ministry; they did not hold any office in the church.</S>
