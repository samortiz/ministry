        <h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE TWO PROVISIONS<br />
BY READING THE WORD AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>Since God has given us the holy Word and the Holy Spirit, we should enjoy them. Some Christians are short of experience because they only read the Bible without praying; they contact the Bible with their mind without contacting the Spirit with their spirit. They appreciate the Bible but not the Spirit. When they read the Bible, they are reading dead letters; hence, they are not able to receive a supply of life. Other Christians pray but do not read the Bible. These Christians may be burning in spirit, but since they are not clear concerning the truth, they pray in ignorance. Furthermore, their fervency cannot last, because it is not based on enlightenment from the Word. Both types of Christians are not normal.</p>
<p>Since we have the Spirit within us and the Bible in our hand, we should enjoy both. When we read the Bible, we should pray. We should be like the brother who read Genesis 1:1. After reading this verse, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord, You created the heavens and the earth in the beginning.&rdquo; When we pray in this way, we will be inspired with praise and say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the beginning of all things.&rdquo; Then the Spirit will have the way to ask us whether it is God or we who initiate the things that we do. Being enlightened in such a way is an indication that the words in the Bible have entered into us and have become spirit and life.</p>
<p>Some believers say that it is easy to read the New Testament, but a brother once told me that it is a closed book to him. He did not understand the first sentence of Matthew 1: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.&rdquo; When he read verse 2, &ldquo;Abraham begot Isaac, and Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his brothers,&rdquo; he was confused by all the begettings. This brother&rsquo;s problem is also the problem of many other saints. In order to deal with this problem, in 1936 we published the pamphlet <em>Gleanings from the Genealogy of Christ.</em> This pamphlet deals specifically with the genealogy in Matthew 1. However, it is possible to receive the supply from this portion of the Word without understanding its interpretation. When we read Matthew 1:1, we should pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are the son of David and the son of Abraham. I do not know who David was, nor do I know who Abraham was, but I know that they were men. Lord, I praise You that You are the Son of Man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we are willing to pray according to what we read in the Bible, we will sense that the Lord Jesus is lovely. Then we might praise Him by saying, &ldquo;Lord, You created the heavens and the earth. You are the Lord of all, yet You became the son of David and the son of Abraham. You became the Son of Man.&rdquo; This is the way to be filled with Christ.</p>
<p>When we are filled with Christ, we will not lose our temper. Suppose a brother spends time with the Lord in the morning, but instead of mentioning his temper, sins, and the world, he reads Matthew 1:1 and spends ten minutes to pray over it by beholding, worshipping, and praising the Lord. He will be filled with the Lord, and his temper will not overcome him, nor will any problem suppress him, because he has touched the Lord&rsquo;s word, and the Spirit has turned this word into life within him. We can be filled with the element of Christ even by praying over a seemingly dry verse.</p>
<p>Some saints think that the four Gospels are not very meaningful, and they do not like to read them. Matthew 8:1-3 says, &ldquo;When He came down from the mountain...a leper, coming near, worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me. And stretching out His hand, He touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed!&rdquo; Some saints say that these words are ordinary and should not be considered as the Scriptures. But if a saint is willing to use his spirit and pray over even this portion of the Bible, he will be supplied. He might say, &ldquo;Lord, if You had not come down from the mountain, that leper would not have been cleansed. But You came down from the mountain to the place where we, the lepers, are. When You cleansed us, You were so considerate that You stretched out Your hand to touch us.&rdquo; By praying in such a way, he will touch the sweetness of this portion of the Word. This portion does not speak of sin and the world, nor does it exhort us to be patient, meek, and loving. But if we would use our spirit to pray over this portion of the Word, these words will become spirit and life within us, and the element of Christ will increase in us. As a result, we will stay away from sin and the world, and we will be patient, meek, and loving.</p>
<p>It does not matter whether we have a bad temper or other weaknesses that we cannot overcome. We do not need to bear these matters in prayer to the Lord. We should put aside our sins and our weaknesses and instead read a portion of the Word and turn it into prayer and praise. Then we will be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s sweetness, joy, and glory. This is the way to be victorious over sin and filled with Christ.</p>
<p>The Lord is the Word, and He is the Spirit. Moreover, the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life. We can read the Bible, and we can be filled with the Spirit through prayer. If the Lord&rsquo;s words remain in our mind, without touching our spirit, they will be merely words, not spirit and life. Therefore, we should not only use our mind when we read the Bible; we must also exercise our spirit and pray. Then the words will pass through our mind into our spirit. Once the words of God&rsquo;s holy Word enter our spirit, they will become spirit and life to us.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly stressed the need to pray after we hear a message. It is not enough to nod our heads in agreement; we must also stir our spirit and let our spirit be enlivened. If we only nod our heads, we may not grow in life, because the words that we hear will remain in our mind, not in our spirit. We should pray when we read the Word, and we should pray after we listen to a message. May we learn to use not only our mind to receive the Word but also our spirit to receive the Holy Spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
