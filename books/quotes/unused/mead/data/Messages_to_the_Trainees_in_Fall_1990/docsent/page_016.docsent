   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ORGANISM OF THE PROCESSED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND DISPENSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The divine revelation in the Gospel of John, concerning the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity for the divine purpose and goal in the divine economy, goes further to its highest degree in chapter fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to what is revealed in John 15, the bride of Christ, who is His Body, eventually becomes the organism of the processed and dispensed Triune God, to express such a Triune God in a corporate way, until it reaches its peak in expressing and manifesting the processed and dispensed Triune God, as what will be consummated in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE DIVINE MINGLING</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all have to realize that the real Christian life, the real life of the believers in Christ, is not an exchanged life but a mingled life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The divine dispensing of the divine Trinity into our being is a matter of being mingled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regeneration is the initiation of the divine mingling, the mingling of the divine Spirit with our human spirit Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Breathing, drinking, eating, and growing are the continual dispensing of the divine Trinity into us as a continuation of this divine mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE "ROOT HAIRS" OF OUR CHRISTIAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to my consideration, breathing, drinking, eating, and growing are the "root hairs" of our Christian life to keep us in the continual dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Triune God has passed through all the process to become the wonderful life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we need to enjoy the continual dispensing of this One into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we need the root hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A tree grows by its root hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we have been regenerated, we have the life and nature of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But in order to survive and to live, we need to breathe all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every breath is a root hair.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We also need to drink and eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The breathing, eating, drinking, and growing in the Lord are the root hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We believe in the processed, dispensing Triune God and realize that we have been regenerated, yet we may not breathe, drink, eat, or grow in a regular way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The root hairs of our Christian life should be like the countless root hairs of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All day long, we need to breathe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some saints may not call on the Lord for three days or even a month.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, there is no growth in the Lord with them because there are no root hairs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to call on the Lord all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why Paul tells us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To pray is both to breathe and to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>M.E. Barber said in a hymn that "to breathe the Name of Jesus is to drink of Life indeed" Hymns, #73 . We have to call, to pray, to breathe, to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then we have to eat the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also need to abide in the Lord that we may grow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we take care of these life matters, we will be people who are in the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity to carry out the divine economy for the fulfillment of the divine purpose.</S>
