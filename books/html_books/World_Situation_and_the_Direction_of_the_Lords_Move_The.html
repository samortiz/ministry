<h1 class="title">THE RECENT CHANGES<br />
IN THE WORLD SITUATION<br />
AND<br />
THE NEED OF AN APPROPRIATE<br />
DIRECTION FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE<br />
IN HIS RECOVERY TODAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Ezek. 1:15-16; Dan. 2:34-35</h1>
<p>In this chapter we have the burden to see the world situation and the direction of the Lord&rsquo;s move. This burden can be expressed in the following four statements:</p>
<p>1) The people who know their God will show strength and take action&mdash;Dan. 11:32.</p>
<p>2) The truths in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need to be spread to the whole earth&mdash;cf. Matt. 24:14.</p>
<p>3) Go and teach all the nations&mdash;cf. Matt. 28:19.</p>
<p>4) How beautiful are the feet of those who go and teach&mdash;cf. Rom. 10:15.</p>
<p>Before March 1991, I had no thought about a new direction for the Lord&rsquo;s move, but right after the war between the allies of the United Nations and Iraq, I received a deep impression. The recent war with Iraq was fought for only four days plus four hours, altogether one hundred hours. Right after that war, I reconsidered the world situation. We have to consider what the Lord wants us to do in this present time. There is the need of an appropriate direction for the Lord&rsquo;s move in His recovery today to match the recent changes in the world situation.</p>
<p>While we have been changing in recent years in order to practice the church life according to the God-ordained way, the world has also been changing. Because of the present situation in the world, there needs to be an appropriate direction for the Lord&rsquo;s move in His recovery today. We should not think that the present changes in the world situation are meaningless. The Lord is not only the Creator of the universe but also the Ruler of the entire world.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, learned this lesson. He came to know that he was not the ruler of the earth but that the unique God, the One in the heavens, is (Dan. 4:28-37). There is the rule of the heavens on earth. Whatever happens in the world situation must be something of the Lord. When we see the many changes in today&rsquo;s world situation, we have to wake up. Our eyes need to be opened. We should exercise our spirit to say, &ldquo;Lord, what do You mean in all of these changes, and what concerns us in all of these changes?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">A HISTORICAL FACT&mdash;<br />
THE WORLD SITUATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN<br />
THE INDICATOR OF THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE ON EARTH</h2>
<p>There have been many great and recent changes in the world. It is a historical fact that the world situation has always been the indicator of the Lord&rsquo;s move on earth. Some have said that the Bible is a history of the Jews. This understanding, however, is not entirely correct. It is correct to say that the history in the Bible is centered around Israel, but the Bible is not just a history of the Jews. The Bible is a history of God&rsquo;s economy. Israel has been the center of the carrying out of God&rsquo;s economy on earth. God is not interested merely in the history of the Jews. His interest is in His economy which is being carried out by Him on earth. The carrying out of His economy has much to do with the world situation.</p>
<p>Genesis 10 gives a record of how the nations of the earth were divided after the flood (cf. v. 32). These nations were set up by ambitious persons, but they were not that prominent. One day, however, the Lord Himself established a nation, the nation of Israel. After Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt, Joshua brought them into the good land. Then God used David to establish the nation of Israel by defeating the enemies, by building up the city of Jerusalem, and by preparing for the building up of the temple to be God&rsquo;s house on earth. Later, after David&rsquo;s son, Solomon, built the temple, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to destroy the nation of Israel.</p>
<p>Daniel 2 records that Nebuchadnezzar had a dream which Daniel interpreted. In that dream there was a great human image. The golden head of this image signifies Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian Empire. The breast and arms of silver signify the Medo-Persian Empire. The belly and thighs of brass signify the Grecian Empire with Alexander the Great. The legs and feet of iron signify the Roman Empire. The feet of the image are part iron and part clay, signifying the nations in the period after the fall of Rome and before the second coming of Christ. This image shows the four great empires on earth with their governments. It is actually a prophetic illustration of the history of human government, sovereignly arranged by the Lord for the carrying out of His economy.</p>
<p>Just before the beginning of the new testament age, Julius Caesar conquered the area of Palestine. Later, his adopted son, Augustus, became the first formal Caesar of the Roman Empire in 27 B.C. That empire was greatly used by God in the carrying out of His New Testament economy. It was under Augustus that Christ was born, and it was under the Roman Empire that Christ was crucified. Without the Roman Empire, Christ would have had no way to be born according to the prophetic details of the Old Testament. Furthermore, Christ would have had no way to die on the cross according to the details of the Old Testament prophecies. Christ&rsquo;s birth and death took place through the means of the Roman Empire. When the Roman Empire was formed, that was an indicator that God was going to do something directly to accomplish His New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire also conquered the entire Mediterranean region, bringing all the nations around the Mediterranean Sea under its governmental control, and Greek became its common language. Furthermore, highways were built throughout the Roman Empire to make travel easier and safer. This was a preparation for the spreading of the gospel after Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p>
<p>The history of the church also shows that the world situation is the indicator of the Lord&rsquo;s move on earth. The Reformation with Martin Luther was greatly strengthened and helped by Germany. Later in world history Spain became the prevailing world power. However, in the sixteenth century England was raised up to defeat the Spanish Armada. This limited the spread of Catholicism and gave a way for the truth of the gospel to be propagated. Under England&rsquo;s influence, the gospel was spread all over the earth.</p>
<p>Today the Lord needs the truths of His recovery to be spread to the whole earth. America, the last great territory on earth, discovered by Columbus, is being used by the Lord for His recovery. This was also under the Lord&rsquo;s sovereignty for the carrying out of His New Testament economy. In order to see more details concerning the relationship between the world situation and the direction of the Lord&rsquo;s move, I would recommend that you read the book entitled <em>The World Situation and God&rsquo;s Move.</em> In this book I mentioned that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the Lord&rsquo;s ultimate move and that the United States will be the ultimate power on earth used by the Lord to carry out His move.</p>
<p>I have been observing the world situation since the end of the First World War. I have spent my lifetime studying the Bible with the help of history. I began to minister for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States in 1962. At that time I pointed out three things to a number of the brothers concerning the world situation. First, I told the brothers that the center of world activity in the West would eventually turn to the area of the Pacific. In the past, Western culture was centered around the Mediterranean. After Columbus&rsquo;s discovery of America, it spread to the Atlantic. I told the brothers that in the future it would spread from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Second, I mentioned to the brothers that eventually California would become the main state in the United States. At that time New York was the most important state, the Empire State. Third, I told them that the financial activity would gradually turn from being centered on the East Coast to being focused on the West Coast. I told the brothers these three things twenty-nine years ago, and they have all come to pass.</p>
<p>Recently, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em> had an article speaking about how the major activity of the world has turned from the Atlantic to the Pacific. This article gave many statistics to prove this point. Specifically, it pointed out the tremendous amount of trade there is between the Far East and the United States. It stated that the trade between the Far East and the United States is fifty percent more than the trade between the United States and the countries across the Atlantic. The United States is the ultimate power on earth for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s economy. Today we are in the final stages of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery for the carrying out of His New Testament economy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WHEEL WITHIN THE WHEEL&mdash;<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S MOVE IN OUR MOVE</h2>
<p>The greatest revelation in Ezekiel 1 is the wheel within the wheel (vv. 15-16). The book we have published entitled <em>The Visions of Ezekiel</em> covers this revelation (see chapter six). A wheel is something for moving. The Lord&rsquo;s move and our move are both signified by a wheel. The wheel within the wheel is the Lord&rsquo;s move in our move. When God&rsquo;s people move, God moves. If God&rsquo;s people do not move, God has no way to move.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE WORLD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Europe Having Been Formed into One Situation</h2>
<p>Our eyes need to be opened to see the present situation of the world. Today Europe has been formed into one situation. A tunnel across the English Channel from England to France has recently been cut through. England and France are both members of the European Common Market. The European Common Market is composed of twelve countries, and these countries will eventually have a common currency. Furthermore, the people of these countries will eventually have a common passport, making travel among these countries so easy.</p>
<p>The Bible prophesies that ten kingdoms will be joined together under the Antichrist in the revived Roman Empire in Europe (Rev. 17:12). The Common Market is very similar to that coming kingdom. These nations in the European Common Market will also have a common language. This language will probably be English.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Russia Having Been Formed into One Situation</h2>
<p>The countries of Europe have been joined together into one situation, leaving Russia out. In today&rsquo;s world, Russia has been formed into one situation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Arab Countries Having Been Formed<br />
into One Situation against Israel</h2>
<p>The Arab countries have also been formed into one situation against Israel. God&rsquo;s heart is for building up Israel, but the plot of the Arab countries is to destroy it. Through the recent war involving Iraq in the Middle East, Israel has been profited, and the opposing Arab countries have been put down. The result of the four-day, four-hour war was that Israel gained the benefit. The United States protected Israel, even begged Israel not to fight, and told Israel that they would do the fighting. This situation is unique in human history.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Far East Countries<br />
Having Been Formed into One Situation</h2>
<p>The Far East countries have also been formed into one situation. The countries of Taiwan, Japan, and Korea are consumed with making money. Much of their money is made through their relationship with the United States.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The United States Standing<br />
as a Particular Situation That Is Friendly<br />
with Every Situation, Especially with Israel</h2>
<p>The United States stands as a particular situation that is friendly with every situation, especially with Israel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INFLUENTIAL FACTORS<br />
OF THE PRESENT SITUATION OF THE WORLD</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The United States Taking the Lead<br />
in Finance, Politics, and Military</h2>
<p>Now we need to point out the influential factors of the present situation of the world. Who runs the entire world today? First, the United States takes the lead in finance, politics, and military. The weapons and the strategy used by the United States in the war with Iraq were all new. After this four-day, four-hour war, the whole world was convinced and subdued by the United States. Russia has been the second super power, competing with the United States. But today Russia is in a terrible economic crisis, and now they are begging for financial help to buy their food.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Europe Cooperating<br />
in Finance, Politics, and Military</h2>
<p>Europe is the second influential factor of the world&rsquo;s present situation. Europe cooperates with the United States in finance, politics, and military. England especially takes the lead to cooperate with the United States in everything.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Far East Cooperating Mainly in Finance</h2>
<p>The Far East is the third influential factor. The nations of the Far East cooperate with the United States mainly in finance. Japan especially has made much money in its economic relationship with the United States. Taiwan and Korea have also profited greatly in this way. Taiwan, mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the overseas Chinese may be considered as &ldquo;five Chinas.&rdquo; The people in these areas are mainly concerned with prospering in finance.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT SPREADING OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Initiated in the Far East and Growing There</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us was initiated through Brother Nee approximately seventy years ago. Also, the Russian revolution to bring in Communism began approximately seventy years ago. The czarist rule in Russia was replaced by Communism under Lenin. Around the same time, the first local church in China was established in Brother Nee&rsquo;s hometown. Today Communism has been proven a failure, but the recovery of the practical church life is still prevailing. The Lord initiated His recovery among us in the Far East, and it is still growing there.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Brought to and Rooted in<br />
the United States for Growth</h2>
<p>In the early 1960s, the recovery was brought to the Western world and into the English language. It has been brought to and rooted in the United States for growth. Through the English language in the past twenty-nine years, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has spread to every inhabited continent. The entire world is open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today in the matter of the divine truth in the Bible because people are hungry for the divine truth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Still in the Stage of Initiation in Europe</h2>
<p>Recently, a group of brothers traveled to Eastern Europe and Russia, and they have testified of the openness and immense hunger of the people there for the divine truth. They visited one city in eastern Germany where they found a meeting of a group of about six hundred Russians who had migrated there. These Russians spoke to the brothers about six books that are being published in Russian. Two are by Brother Nee&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Life</em> and <em>The Spiritual Man.</em> Four are by me&mdash;<em>The Experience of Life, The Knowledge of Life, The Economy of God,</em>and <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</em>. They told the brothers that they could distribute one million copies of each of the six books in a quick way if they were available. This shows the hunger of the people there for the truth. At this point I would like to ask one of the brothers who traveled to Eastern Europe to give a testimony of what he saw there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">__________________________________________________</p>
<p class="indent1"><em>Testimony</em>: I had the privilege of spending ten days both in Switzerland and Germany, especially in the eastern part of Germany. Since the Second World War, eastern Germany has basically been closed off to Western influence of any kind. We felt that it was really a preserved area. The communist system got rid of everything that was not real in the way of religion. Anyone who had anything in them for God really paid a price to maintain that and to meet with Christians.</p>
<p class="indent1">Our goal in going was especially to see the situation in the universities. We spent three days on three campuses. These campuses were in Leipzig and Berlin. We found that, especially in the eastern area of Berlin that has been basically untouched by Western influence, the young people were preserved and were very open to anything that we said. Some of them had never seen an American. During these three days, we spent our time going to the college cafeterias to meet the students. The students would sit with us, and we would speak the truth of the gospel to them.</p>
<p class="indent1">It is not a small thing to be a university student there. From the time that these students are young, they are raised up knowing that they are going to the university, and this is all that they have in mind. The young people in the universities are of the highest caliber. They are very serious, and they see a bright future ahead of them. They are eager to hear everything from the West.</p>
<p class="indent1">The first group of students to whom I talked happened to be English majors. Although we could communicate by using <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> [a gospel booklet] in German, they followed more closely by using the English which they had learned in school. I began to show them how man was made in three parts. For the first time their eyes were beholding the diagram of the three circles illustrating the tripartite man, and they saw how they were created with a human spirit to contain God. I shared with them the diagram of the processed Triune God entering into the tripartite man, and they were completely focused on this. At one point, one girl said, &ldquo;You have to tell us more about the Bible. We don&rsquo;t know anything about the Bible.&rdquo; This describes the kind of atmosphere that was there with many of the ones to whom we spoke. A number in Leipzig prayed with us right there in the cafeteria. We plan on continuing the contact with them.</p>
<p class="indent1">Leipzig was a special situation because there was very little Western influence there. We asked the students about some from the West coming there to study. They told us that they hardly ever heard of such a thing. Even some of the administrators wondered why anyone would want to come there to study. In the recent year, the university we visited in Leipzig lost many students who immediately took the opportunity to study in the West. Again, I want to say that we felt this was a very preserved situation for the Lord&rsquo;s move there.</p>
<p class="indent1">When we were in Berlin, we saw that there was more of a Western influence. Among the ones we contacted, we saw more religion and philosophy. But overall we felt that the basic need was for laborers. If some would be there speaking the truth as we did in the short time we were there, the Lord could really gain something. Several of the ones we spoke with said that they were raised as atheists. They did not know anything about God, and they had never had a Bible. To them all of the Bible truths are brand new.</p>
<p class="indent1">While we were there, we only contacted one person who was involved in any Christian activity. One of the students we spoke to was carrying a simple gospel tract which he had obtained, but nobody had ever led him to the Lord. A seed had been planted in him, but it had never been reaped. The brothers asked him to pray with them. He was open, and he prayed with them to receive the Lord.</p>
<p class="indent1">There was very little trace of Christian activity in the places we visited. One thing that we really saw was the spiritual and material void left by communism. Because everything had belonged to the state, there was no motivation in the people to maintain anything. There is an atmosphere in which there is not much to live for physically, and there is a void inwardly. The students we spoke to desired to know the truth and they wanted to know about God.</p>
<p class="indent1">Through our contact with those in Leipzig, about eight received the Lord. In Berlin the brothers contacted a Russian-speaking woman who was baptized. She was our first fruit from eastern Berlin. She prayed with the brothers to receive the Lord, and then she invited them to her home that night for dinner. They baptized her that evening. This was a real confirmation of the openness there.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">__________________________________________________</p>
<p>The above testimony is a confirmation of the open door in Europe for the Lord&rsquo;s move. We have also received word that many of the people in Eastern Europe and Russia will only accept the writings of Watchman Nee and Witness Lee. They said that if we sent them millions of copies of our writings, they would distribute them. There is a famine of truth in that part of the world. Some of the people there have even begged the brothers to send people to teach them the Bible.</p>
<p>In both the Far East and the United States, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is growing, but it is still in the stage of initiation in Europe. We should remember that the United States, Europe, and the Far East are the three influential factors of the present situation of the world. The recovery has taken root in the United States and the Far East, but there is a void in Europe. For this reason, the Lord&rsquo;s direction of His present recovery must be toward Europe. The recovery in Europe is still in the stage of initiation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF EUROPE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Europe, in Its Geographical Location,<br />
in Its People, in Its Culture in History,<br />
and in Its Capacity in Ability, Being Crucial<br />
to the Present Situation of the World</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the importance of Europe in two things. First, Europe, in its geographical location, in its people, in its culture in history, and in its capacity in ability, is crucial to the present situation of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Europe, in the Consummation<br />
of the Fulfillment of the Vision concerning<br />
the Great Human Image in Daniel 2,<br />
Being Also More Vitally Crucial Than<br />
Any Other Country and Race&mdash;<br />
the Crushing of the Two Feet<br />
of the Great Human Image Being the Crushing<br />
of the Entire Human Government</h2>
<p>Further, Europe, in the consummation of the fulfillment of the vision concerning the great human image in Daniel 2, is also more vitally crucial than any other country and race&mdash; the crushing of the two feet of the great human image will be the crushing of the entire human government (vv. 34-35). We have already pointed out what this great human image prophetically typifies. The periods of history signified by the head, the breast and the arms, the belly and the thighs, and the legs have been fulfilled. But the ten toes have not been fulfilled. According to Revelation 17:12, ten kings will be raised up before the great tribulation in the revived Roman Empire. They will be one with Antichrist in opposing God and persecuting His people&mdash;the Jews and the believers. These ten kings are likened to the ten toes of the great image seen by Nebuchadnezzar in his dream (Dan. 2:42). They will submit themselves and their kingdom to Antichrist (Rev. 17:17).</p>
<p>Western culture is composed of Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics. Roman politics is carrying on Western culture, and the Bible prophesies that the Roman Empire will be revived. The ten kings typified by the ten toes of the great image in Daniel 2 will be under Antichrist, who will be the last Caesar of the Roman Empire (see Revelation 17:10-11 with notes&mdash;Recovery Version). All of this will transpire in Europe.</p>
<p>When the Lord comes to crush human government, He will crush the feet with the ten toes. This will be the crushing of the entire image from the head to the feet. Daniel 2:34-35 says, &ldquo;You were watching until a stone was cut out without hands, and it struck the image at its feet of iron and clay and crushed them. Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at once, and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found. And the stone that struck the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.&rdquo; Christ is the great stone who will crush the two feet of the great image, which will be the crushing of the entire human image, the entire human government.</p>
<p>We need to see this as a basis to understand the Lord&rsquo;s mind. Before this crushing transpires, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must spread to Europe and be rooted there. The spreading of the truths of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will be a preparation for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to bring the recovery and restoration not only to Israel but also to the entire creation.</p>
<p>Of the three influential factors in today&rsquo;s world, the Far East and the United States have been occupied and taken by the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Europe still remains as a region in which the Lord&rsquo;s recovery needs to be rooted and grow. I hope that we would bring this fellowship to the Lord and pray. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, these days are the consummation of the age. Lord, in these days rekindle my love toward You.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE SPREADING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
AND RESTORATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 3:15-16; Acts 8:27-37; Heb. 5:11-12; 9:1-10; 2 Tim. 2:15; 2 Pet. 3:15-16</h1>
<p>In chapter one we saw the recent changes in the world situation and the need of an appropriate direction for the Lord&rsquo;s move in His recovery today. In this chapter we want to see the need of the spreading of the divine truths for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and restoration. I hope that our hearts would be touched through this fellowship.</p>
<p>Some Christians may refer to the need of the spreading of the gospel, but in this chapter I want to stress the divine truths. The Bible unveils to us not only the gospel in a narrow sense but also the entire divine revelation. Actually, the gospel includes all the divine truths. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are called the four Gospels. They cover many things which are altogether neglected and missed in today&rsquo;s Christianity. When I say &ldquo;the divine truths,&rdquo; I am referring to the New Testament economy of God, which is the gospel.</p>
<p>Paul called his entire sixteen-chapter Epistle to the Romans &ldquo;the gospel of God&rdquo; (1:1). The gospel of God in Romans does not include merely the truth concerning justification by faith in the first four chapters. It also includes the Body of Christ in chapter twelve and the local churches in chapter sixteen. Even the local churches are included in the gospel. Without the church, where is the gospel? According to my experience, the gospel would be very deficient and poor without the church. Actually, the entire New Testament is the gospel, from the first page of Matthew through the last page of Revelation. The New Testament as the gospel is typified by the Old Testament. Thus, we may say that the gospel actually includes the entire Bible.</p>
<p>God has spoken in the Bible, and He is still speaking today. The Bible is a record of God&rsquo;s speaking in the past, but God has not stopped speaking. He is still speaking today in His Son (Heb. 1:2), and His Son is speaking in His servants, the members of His Body (cf. 2 Cor. 13:3). His speaking in His servants is God&rsquo;s gospel, which includes all the divine truths.</p>
<p>God does everything by speaking. Genesis 1 shows that God&rsquo;s speaking was His work. God said, &ldquo;Let there be light: and there was light&rdquo; (v. 3). Speaking is God&rsquo;s work. In John 5:25 the Lord said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live.&rdquo; This refers to those who are dead in spirit, according to Ephesians 2:1 and 5 and Colossians 2:13. Hence, to live in this verse means to be alive in spirit. This shows that even salvation is carried out by God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>Our preaching comes from God&rsquo;s speaking. We do not preach our word but His word for Him to speak. When He spoke, the old creation came into being. When He speaks, the new creation, the believers in Christ, comes into being. Hebrews 1:1 says that God has spoken. Furthermore, God is still speaking in every member of the Body of Christ. Every member of the Body is a mouthpiece through whom God can speak. This is why 1 Corinthians 14:31 says that we can all prophesy. The word <em>all</em> in this verse includes the sisters also (1 Cor. 11:5; Acts 2:17-18). As members of the Body of Christ, all of us can speak for the Lord and should speak for the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery spreads through those who speak for Him. In the early 1960s, the Lord&rsquo;s recovery came to the United States through the divine speaking.</p>
<p>God has surely spoken in the Bible. The greatest thing produced among mankind is the Bible. Although God has spoken in the Bible, man does not understand what He has spoken. About thirty years ago when I came to the United States, I began to speak about the human spirit. Wherever I spoke concerning this, people told me that they had never heard that they had a spirit. God has spoken in the Bible that He created a spirit for man. Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. Man&rsquo;s spirit is as important for God as the heavens and the earth. The heavens, the earth, and man are three important items in this universe, and the most crucial thing within man is man&rsquo;s spirit. Second Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord be with your spirit.&rdquo; This is a verse in the Bible, but who understands it? Years ago many people told me that if I had not spoken about the human spirit, they would have never known that they had a spirit within them. First Thessalonians 5:23 strongly shows that man is of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. However, not many teach the revelation of the tripartite man.</p>
<p>We have spoken much concerning God&rsquo;s economy. The word <em>economy</em> is the Greek word <em>oikonomia</em> anglicized, which has been translated into <em>dispensation</em>
 or <em>stewardship</em> in the New Testament. In the book of Ephesians, this Greek word is used three times&mdash;in 1:10; 3:2; and 3:9. But outside of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, who has taught, preached, or expounded the Bible on the truth of God&rsquo;s economy? People may teach husbands to love their wives, and wives to submit to their husbands, but who knows what God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s dispensing are? This again shows that God has spoken in the Bible, but there is not much understanding of what God has spoken.</p>
<p>Many Christians know from the Bible that God is the unique God who created the universe and man. They know that men became fallen sinners. Therefore, God so loved the world that He sent His Son to save us through His death on the cross. He shed His blood, and we are redeemed. However, who knows why we have been redeemed? Many think that we have been redeemed to go to heaven. Very few know the purpose of our redemption according to the divine revelation in the Bible.</p>
<p>Even the word <em>church,</em> a translation of the Greek word <em>ekklesia,</em> has been misunderstood. Many think that the church is a building with a high tower. Some teach people that since they are children of God, they should behave themselves so that they can please God, glorify God, and make God happy. If they do this, they will go to heaven. Otherwise, they will suffer perdition. This teaching is absolutely false and unscriptural. Others in Christianity teach positive thinking. They proclaim that positive thinking will make people rich. There are also many teachings today concerning how to have a successful marriage.</p>
<p>I am sharing these things to illustrate the lack of the divine truths today in Christianity. I am so burdened to see the truths of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery spread to the whole earth. Much of what is spoken in today&rsquo;s Christianity is superficial and even superstitious. Millions of copies of the Bible have been sold, but who knows what the Bible speaks in its proper sense adequately? John 4:24 says that God is Spirit and that those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality. However, who knows what it means to worship in spirit and reality? God has spoken in the Bible, but who understands what He has really spoken?</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE REVELATION IN THE HOLY WRITINGS&mdash;<br />
THE WRITINGS OF THE HOLY BIBLE</h2>
<p>Now we need to see the steps the Lord has taken to give us the divine truths. First, we have the divine revelation in the holy writings&mdash;the writings of the holy Bible (2 Tim. 3:16). The Old Testament was written in Hebrew, and the New Testament was written in Greek.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRANSLATION OF THE HOLY WRITINGS&mdash;<br />
THE OLD TESTAMENT USED BY THE LORD JESUS<br />
IN HIS SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE<br />
WAS NOT IN THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE,<br />
BUT WAS A GREEK TRANSLATION,<br />
THE SEPTUAGINT VERSION</h2>
<p>In order to have the divine truths, there needs to be the translation of the holy writings. God has spoken in Hebrew and Greek, but what He has spoken needs to be properly translated. Even the Old Testament used by the Lord Jesus in His speaking to the people was not in the original language, but was a Greek translation, the Septuagint version. This version was a translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek, completed about three hundred years before Christ was born. It was translated by seventy Jewish scholars, and the Lord Jesus and early apostles quoted from it a number of times. The translation of the holy writings is a great thing. Without the translation of the Bible into many languages, most people would not be able to read it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INTERPRETATION OF THE HOLY WRITINGS</h2>
<p>In addition to the translation of the holy writings, there needs to be the interpretation of the holy writings (Acts 8:27-37; Heb. 5:11-12; 9:1-10, especially v. 5; 2 Tim. 2:15; 2 Pet. 3:15-16). For example, who can explain what it means in Daniel 11:32 for the people who know their God to show strength and to take action? This word refers to the Jewish heroes, who were known as the Maccabees. They defeated Antiochus Epiphanes, who was the first type of the coming Antichrist. The word in Daniel 11:32 was spoken to the Maccabees, encouraging them to defeat Antiochus, to show strength and take action.</p>
<p>There is a story in Acts 8 of Philip&rsquo;s encounter with an Ethiopian eunuch which illustrates the need of the interpretation of the Word. This eunuch had come to worship in Jerusalem and was returning to Ethiopia. He was reading Isaiah 53 when Philip approached his chariot. When Philip heard him reading, he asked, &ldquo;Do you really know what you are reading?&rdquo; (v. 30). Then the eunuch said, &ldquo;How can I unless someone guides me?&rdquo; (v. 31). To some, Isaiah 53 may be easy to understand, but to that eunuch it was difficult. This shows that without the interpretation and exposition of the Bible, people cannot understand it.</p>
<p>Some have said that they do not need the Life-studies and that they just read the pure Bible. But if people merely read the Bible without the proper exposition of the Bible, they will not be able to understand it in many portions. Paul said in Hebrews that he had much to say concerning Melchesidec as a type of Christ, but that this was hard to explain because the Hebrews had become dull of hearing. He told the Hebrews that they should have been teachers by that time, but they were still babes in understanding the holy Word (5:10-13).</p>
<p>In Hebrews 9, Paul speaks of the first tabernacle, the Holy Place, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, as symbols of two covenants. The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant as a type (vv. 1-2, 6, 8-10), and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant as a reality (vv. 3-5, 7-8, 10-12). In verse 9 Paul said that the first tabernacle mentioned in verse 8 was a figure, a type, for the present time, which is the new testament age. The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, was a symbol of the old covenant and, at the same time, it was also a type of the new testament age. Without Paul&rsquo;s guidance, how could we understand that the first tabernacle typifies the new testament age? Even today not many people realize that the first tabernacle is a type of the new testament age. (For more help concerning this truth, see message thirty-nine of the <em>Life-study of Hebrews.</em>)</p>
<p>There is a great amount of truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. We have published Life-study messages on the entire twenty-seven books of the New Testament. This was completed by our having two annual trainings from 1974 to 1986. The Life-studies do not replace the Bible. Rather, they open the Bible, expound the Bible, and release the unsearchable riches in the Bible.</p>
<p>Recently, I was having a time with the Lord in the morning with the help of the publication we have entitled <em>The Holy Word for Morning Revival.</em> I was praying over Ephesians 6:23, which says, &ldquo;Peace to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; I was asking myself what <em>peace</em> and <em>love with faith</em> meant. I forgot that I had written a note on this verse in the Recovery Version, so I read it. The note points out that faith is to receive Christ (John 1:12) and love is to enjoy Christ (14:23). Then it says, &ldquo;Here it is not faith and love, nor love and faith, but love <em>with</em> faith, because this is the conclusion of the book on the church, which needs to enjoy Christ in love with faith, which works through love (Gal. 5:6). Thus peace will also be her portion.&rdquo; I received much help from reading this note on Ephesians 6:23. This shows that we need the interpretation and the exposition of the Word.</p><h2 class="head1">THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOLY WRITINGS&mdash;<br />
HENCE, THE LEARNING OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS<br />
BY STUDYING THE TRANSLATED AND INTERPRETED<br />
HOLY WRITINGS IS NECESSARY</h2>
<p>Since the holy writings have been translated and interpreted, we need the understanding of the holy writings. Hence, the learning of the divine truths by studying the translated and interpreted holy writings is necessary (2 Tim. 3:15). We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, open my ears so I can hear, and open my eyes so I can see.&rdquo; Paul prayed in Ephesians 1 that the Lord would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation (v. 17). A line in <em>Hymns,</em> #1255 says, &ldquo;When we exercise our spirit, / Our vision is so clear.&rdquo; In order to have the proper understanding of the translated and interpreted holy writings, we need to exercise our spirit. We need to contact God, praying to Him and humbling ourselves by saying, &ldquo;Lord, I know nothing. I need You.&rdquo; I can testify that when I come to the Word in this way, the light is there and I understand it.</p>
<p>Many saints have purchased a complete set of the Life-studies of the New Testament. But some leave them on their bookshelf and do not get into them. We need to learn the divine truths by studying the interpreted holy writings. In these days the Lord needs some to go to Europe and Russia. Europe and Russia are suffering from a famine of the divine truths. If we mean business for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must study all the books we have published. In addition to the Life-studies of the New Testament, we have also published Life-studies on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Isaiah. Many of us can testify that after these books were expounded, they became new to us. We must learn the truths in these books by studying their proper interpretation.</p>
<p>We hope that many saints will emigrate to Europe, according to what is recorded in Acts 8 when the disciples were scattered from Jerusalem while the apostles still remained there. I hope that many will go to Europe to teach the Bible. Some of the seeking ones in Europe have asked the brothers to send people to them to teach them the Bible. This is our burden.</p>
<p>We should not have the concept of going to Europe to have big meetings in the old way. The young people who are burdened to study in the universities there can talk to their classmates one by one about the truths concerning God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensing, Christ, and the church. We will save and gain people in this way. Some may also go to Europe to take a job or do a business. One brother said that many of the houses in eastern Germany are very old and need remodeling. He said that one of the best businesses for the brothers from the United States would be to go there to remodel these homes. As the brothers are working there, they can contact people to gain them for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The best way to prepare ourselves for going to Europe is by studying all the writings we have published to open up the holy Word. We need to learn the divine truths and then spread them to the whole earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HISTORY OF THE INTERPRETATION OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>There is a history of the writing and translation of the Bible, and there is also a history of the interpretation of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Time of the Church Fathers</h2>
<p>After the Bible had been composed and completed, it began to be interpreted in the time of the church fathers. They began to open up the truth concerning the Divine Trinity and the person of Christ. Their study of Christ&rsquo;s person is referred to as Christology. By the fourth century there were many disputes concerning the person of Christ and the Divine Trinity. Constantine the Great, who was the emperor of Rome at the beginning of the fourth century, called a council at Nicaea in A.D. 325 to settle these disputes. Out of this council came the Nicene Creed.</p>
<p>By the end of the sixth century, the Roman Catholic Church was established with the papacy. The Bible was locked up by the Roman Catholic Church. Only the Catholic clergy who knew Greek, Hebrew, and Latin had access to the Bible. This period of time when the Bible was locked up is referred to in history as the Dark Ages.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Time of the Reformation</h2>
<p>Eventually, the Lord used Martin Luther in the sixteenth century to unlock the Bible, to release the Bible from &ldquo;prison.&rdquo; The interpretation of the Bible advanced during this time of the Reformation with the recovery of the truth concerning justification by faith.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Time of the British Brethren</h2>
<p>The British Brethren were raised up by the Lord in 1828 under the leadership of John Nelson Darby. He took the lead to open up the interpretation of the Bible. His <em>Synopsis of the Books of the Bible</em> is a great help to understanding the entire Bible. In his synopsis he opens up the principles of every book. There were also a number of other great teachers among the Brethren. During the early part of the nineteenth century, the light came to them like a flood. Many books full of the truth were published by them. The Lord&rsquo;s move among the Brethren for the release of the biblical truths lasted about one hundred years.</p><h2 class="head2">In the Time from the Initiation<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery among Us until Now</h2>
<p>The interpretation of the Bible advanced even more from the initiation of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery among us until now. Once Brother Nee told me that because Europe and America had been spoiled for the Lord&rsquo;s move, that forced the Lord to go to China. Brother Nee said that China at that time was &ldquo;virgin soil&rdquo; for the truth. However, the missionaries who had gone to China never helped the people there to be clear about the assurance of salvation. The assurance of salvation is clearly revealed in the New Testament, but because most of the missionaries did not know this truth, they had no way of teaching it. The Lord gave Brother Watchman Nee a clear vision of the assurance of salvation, and many were revived by his messages on this truth. The assurance of salvation was then made very clear to the Chinese believers.</p>
<p>In 1935 Brother Nee held a conference in my hometown, Chefoo, to cover the victorious, overcoming life of Christ. Before that time we were not so clear about this truth. In 1940 Brother Nee opened up the truth concerning the Body of Christ and the practical life of the church. He called this the blueprint of the practicality of the local church. I brought that blueprint back with me to northern China. As a result, there was a great revival in the church in Chefoo at the end of 1942.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Interpretation Which Began<br />
from the Trinity and Christology<br />
and Has Been Continuing until It Has Now<br />
Reached the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>In about the last thirty years, what the Lord has mainly shown to us is God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s dispensing, which consummate in the New Jerusalem. It is difficult to find anything in Christian bookstores on the truth concerning the New Jerusalem. Some wrongly believe that the New Jerusalem is a material city with real golden streets. It is difficult to find some who have a biblical view of the holy city as the wife of Christ, as the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man. Many years ago, Tersteegen, a German writer, wrote something about the New Jerusalem in a proper way. About sixty years ago, Brother T. Austin-Sparks wrote something concerning the New Jerusalem. Beginning from about thirty years ago, we began to see more and more concerning the holy city.</p>
<p>We have published many messages concerning the New Jerusalem. In these messages we cover many detailed points concerning the holy city as the consummation of the divine economy and the divine dispensing. I have to give the credit to Brother Nee for what has been revealed to us. I heard him say that the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of the church. This gave me the basis for understanding the New Jerusalem. When the church is completely perfected and established, that will be the New Jerusalem. It will first appear in the thousand-year kingdom on a small scale. Then it will appear in the new heaven and new earth on the fullest scale as the consummation of God&rsquo;s saved people.</p>
<p>The interpretation of the Bible has been built up by the entire Body of Christ through the past nineteen centuries. We inherit all the interpretation of the past centuries and stand on the shoulders of the foregoing teachers. We have to thank the Lord for this. Furthermore, we have to thank the Lord that He has shown us more in the last few decades, such as the practical church life, the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound Spirit, even the seven Spirits, God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensing, and the ultimate consummation of the church, that is, the New Jerusalem, the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man for God&rsquo;s eternal manifestation and expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF THE SPREADING<br />
OF THE UNDERSTOOD DIVINE TRUTHS<br />
FOR THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY AND RESTORATION</h2>
<p>Today there is the need of the spreading of the understood divine truths for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and restoration. We can borrow Romans 10:14-15 and say, &ldquo;How shall people hear without one who spreads? How beautiful are the feet of those who spread the interpreted and understood divine truths!&rdquo; If we have a burden to go to Europe, we must spend day and night to study the truths we have published. Then we will know what the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is, and we will have a real burden to go to Europe to teach people. The Lord charges us in Matthew 28:19 to go and disciple the nations. The Lord&rsquo;s word here shows us that we should be burdened to go and teach all the nations.</p>
<p>There is the need of the spreading of the translated, interpreted, and understood truths for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and restoration. The Lord does everything by speaking. If there is no speaking of the Lord, there is no work of the Lord. There cannot be a recovery in Europe if there is not the speaking of the divine truths. Most of the millions of people in Europe are void of the knowledge of these divine truths.</p>
<p>The spreading of the divine truths will bring in the Lord&rsquo;s restoration. According to Isaiah 11, the restoration will come because &ldquo;the earth will be full of the knowledge of Jehovah, / As the waters cover the sea&rdquo; (v. 9). We have to speak for the Lord to bring in this restoration. How shall people hear without one who spreads the divine truths? How beautiful are the feet of those who spread the interpreted and understood divine truths!</p>
<p>This is why we have to study these truths. Otherwise, we are not qualified to go to Europe. We should not go to speak to people in a superficial way. We may be able to speak John 3:16 to people: &ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&rdquo; However, if someone asks us what eternal life is, we may not be able to tell them. It is possible to give fifteen messages on John 3:16. The first message can be concerning who God is, the second message can be on love, and the third message can be on the world. Then we can tell people how God gave His Son. God did not drop His Son down from the heavens to the earth. He gave His Son through incarnation. Then another message can be given on the only begotten Son. More can be said about what it means to perish and what it is to have eternal life. Message after message can be given on John 3:16.</p>
<p>We are not going there to preach to people in the traditional way, but to talk to them about all the divine truths. Through our speaking, some will be solidly saved. If we speak the deeper truths in John 3:16 to them, they will never forget this verse. May the Lord burden us to learn the divine truths and to spread them everywhere for His recovery and restoration.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">OUR RESPONSIBILITY FOR<br />
THE SPREADING OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS,<br />
ESPECIALLY TO THE CRUCIAL PARTS<br />
OF THE WORLD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; 24:14; Acts 8:1, 4; Isa. 6:1, 8; Dan. 11:32; 2 Tim. 2:21</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw the need of the spreading of the divine truths for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and restoration. In this chapter we want to see our responsibility for the spreading of the divine truths, especially to the crucial parts of the world. Our intention in going to these parts of the world is to minister Christ.</p>
<p>In chapter one we saw the influential factors of the present situation of the world. The United States takes the lead in finance, politics, and military; Europe cooperates in finance, politics, and military; and the Far East cooperates mainly in finance. We also saw the spreading of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It was initiated in the Far East and is growing there. It has been brought to and rooted in the United States for growth. But in Europe the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has not been properly and adequately initiated. There is a great need for some to go there to fill up the lack.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to teach the Bible, to teach the truth. The Bible, of course, is the unique Word, spoken by God. God has spoken in the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and the twenty-seven books of the New Testament. The end of the Bible tells us clearly that no one should add anything to or take anything away from this divine revelation (Rev. 22:18-19). The greatest item in the universe is God Himself, and the second greatest item is God&rsquo;s spoken and written Word.</p>
<p>We have seen that there is also the need of the translation of the Word. Then there is the need for it to be interpreted, expounded, and explained. Following this there is the need of understanding. Then we can speak the word in an interpreted and understood way. This is our commission. The printed ministry among us is full of the interpreted and expounded word according to the proper understanding. The Bible is God&rsquo;s speaking, written by men who spoke from God and were borne by the Spirit (2 Pet. 1:21). The Bible, from the Pentateuch of Moses through the Revelation of the apostle John, took between fifteen hundred and sixteen hundred years to complete. Then this book was read, studied, and investigated by the entire Body of Christ for the past nineteen centuries.</p>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw that the interpretation of the Bible began in the time of the church fathers. They studied the truth concerning the Divine Trinity and the person of Christ. They saw in the New Testament that Christ was a person with a dual nature. He was conceived in a human virgin, but people called Him Emmanuel, meaning God with us (Matt. 1:23). He possesses both humanity and divinity.</p>
<p>We also pointed out that in the sixteenth century, Martin Luther went against the entire Catholic Church to declare the truth of justification by faith. In the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up the British Brethren to recover many biblical truths. They were the ones whom the Lord used to open up the truth concerning the assurance of salvation. <em>Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment</em> by George Cutting was a famous booklet published by them on this subject. In the beginning of the Lord&rsquo;s move in China, we proclaimed this truth so that it could be recovered in a full way.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago no one in the United States spoke clearly about God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s dispensing, the principle of the Body of Christ, and the practicality of the church life on the genuine ground of oneness with the local churches as the local expressions of the Body of Christ. The Lord opened up these truths to us. Eventually, the Lord showed us the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the church. Although the New Jerusalem occupies only the last two chapters of the Bible, we have published many messages concerning it.</p>
<p>From the time of the church fathers, the study of the holy Word has gone on and on throughout the centuries. The church fathers found out that the title for God in Genesis 1, <em>Elohim,</em> is plural in number. In verse 26 the one God said, &ldquo;Let us make man in our image.&rdquo; The one God uses the pronouns <em>us</em> and <em>our</em> when referring to Himself. Eventually, the church fathers used the term <em>triune</em> to describe how God is three-one. They began the study of the Word with the truth concerning God at the beginning of the Bible. Now we have come to the end of the Bible with the truth concerning the New Jerusalem. The first item of the Bible is God, and the last item is the New Jerusalem. God Himself is the beginning, the source, of the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the enlargement, expansion, and increase of God. The New Jerusalem is a corporate entity, the mingling of God with His redeemed, transformed, and glorified people. With the opening up of the truth concerning the New Jerusalem, the Bible has now been interpreted in a consummated way.</p>
<p>We owe so much to many teachers of the Bible who have gone before us, and today we are standing on their shoulders. I consider the notes we have published in the Recovery Version as the aggregate of the proper understanding of the New Testament. We are really blessed to be living in these latter days. We have received the aggregate understanding of the Bible because we are standing on the shoulders of many who have gone before us. Today we understand the Bible better than Martin Luther and J. N. Darby because we have inherited the truth they saw, and by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we are standing on their shoulders and have gone on to see more. The Bible was spoken by God in the holy writings, translated by many scholars, and interpreted by the Body of Christ throughout the centuries. Today the proper understanding of the Bible has been collected in our writings in order for us to study, learn, and spread the divine truths.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANITY&rsquo;S CONDITION<br />
IN THE MATTER OF THE DIVINE TRUTHS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Catholic Church Being Heretical</h2>
<p>Now we need to see Christianity&rsquo;s condition in the matter of the divine truths. First, much of the Catholic Church&rsquo;s teaching is heretical and superstitious.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Protestant Denominations<br />
Being Superficial and Erroneous</h2>
<p>Much of the truth in the Protestant denominations is superficial and erroneous. Many in the denominations use the King James Version. Although this is a top version of the Bible, it uses the pronoun <em>it</em> when referring to the Holy Spirit. This is a big mistake. The Holy Spirit as one among the three of the Divine Trinity is a person. Therefore, the pronoun <em>He</em> should be used when referring to the Spirit. This mistake was corrected by Darby in his New Translation.</p>
<p>The New American Standard Bible is another good translation, which I appreciate. But its translators made a great mistake in their translation of Ephesians 4:22 and 24. These verses in the New American Standard Bible say, &ldquo;Lay aside the old self,&rdquo; and &ldquo;put on the new self.&rdquo; The translators realized that 2:15 is referring to the church as the new man, but here in chapter four they say &ldquo;the new self.&rdquo; This is a great error. According to the biblical truth, we need to put off the old man and put on the new man, the church. This shows that it is hard to trust completely in any single translation of the Bible. I have a great deal of trust, however, in Darby&rsquo;s New Translation and in the 1901 edition of the American Standard Version.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Brethren Being Famous in Knowing the Bible,<br />
but Fading in Knowing the Truths</h2>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the Brethren took the lead in discovering, knowing, and proclaiming the divine truths. Today, however, the Brethren are fading in knowing the truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Pentecostals Being Wild<br />
and without Any Controlling Principle</h2>
<p>In the matter of the divine truths, the Pentecostals are wild and without any controlling principle. In their interpretation of the Bible, they mix up the Old Testament with the New Testament. The songs they sing are mostly from the Old Testament. The rituals and practices of Catholicism are mixed up with the Old Testament, while the Pentecostals&rsquo; interpretation of the truth is mixed up with the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Free Groups Being Too Free<br />
and Careless in Mixtures</h2>
<p>For the believers in Christ to be freed from the bondage and the heresies of Catholicism and from the formalities and the erroneous teachings of Protestantism is good and is also necessary. But to be freed to an extent that the governing principles in interpreting the divine truths are put aside or neglected by ignorance is neither right nor profitable. Sorry to say, today due to the dealings with Catholicism and Protestantism, many dear saints who love the Lord and seek His truths have fallen into this category. Hence, carelessness and mixtures can be seen in many groups in the interpretation of the holy Word today.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery Being Full<br />
of the Divine Truths, but Inadequate<br />
in the Application of the Truths and Slow<br />
in the Spreading of the Truths</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is full of the divine truths but is inadequate in the application of the truths and slow in the spreading of the truths. If we do not get into the truths in the printed ministry, we will be short in the application of these truths. If we are short in the application of the divine truths, we will be short in the experience of these truths. We are also slow in the spreading of the truths. Who among us is willing to be sent by the Lord to another place for the spreading of the divine truths? Instead of having the burden to migrate to spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, many of us have become set, settled, and occupied.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S GIFT AND<br />
COMMISSION TO HIS RECOVERY<br />
IN THE DIVINE TRUTHS</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the Lord&rsquo;s gift and commission to His recovery in the divine truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Having Opened to Us<br />
His Divine Revelation from the Making<br />
of His Eternal Economy to the Consummation<br />
of His Eternal Goal&mdash;the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The Lord has opened to us His divine revelation from the making of His eternal economy to the consummation of His eternal goal&mdash;the New Jerusalem. All the messages we have published unveil the items and details included from God&rsquo;s making of His eternal economy to the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Having Commissioned Us<br />
with the Ministry of His Word</h2>
<p>The Lord has also commissioned us with the ministry of His word. After I was sent to Taiwan from mainland China, we began to publish a paper entitled <em>The Ministry of the Word.</em> Today our ministry has reached the point of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and God&rsquo;s dispensing. In 1984 I shared concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in Stuttgart, Germany and a number of localities in the United States. These are included in a book we have published entitled <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy.</em> I still have more to speak concerning God&rsquo;s economy and God&rsquo;s dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lord Having Provided Us<br />
with the Marvelous Environment<br />
for the Release of His Divine Revelation</h2>
<p>The Lord has provided us with the marvelous environment for the release of the divine revelation. When I began to minister the word in Los Angeles in 1962, we had only conferences and informal trainings. When we moved to Anaheim in 1974, I made the decision to have two ten-day trainings every year. Because these trainings are in the principle of a school, those who come need to be properly enrolled. This helped not only in training the saints but also in having a proper, clear, uplifted atmosphere for the release of the divine truths.</p>
<p>I also decided to have the trainings to help us in the publishing of the ministry. Much of what Brother Nee shared was never put into print. I feel very sorry about this. Because I saw this situation, I decided that after I leave, I do not want the truths the Lord has shown me to be left in my grave. I want to put out whatever the Lord has shown me.</p>
<p>Brother Nee first put out a monthly periodical called <em>The Christian.</em> The subscribers had to pay one dollar a year for this periodical. The orders for this periodical eventually went up to ten thousand copies a month. Later, he changed to publish a periodical called <em>The Present Testimony</em> without subscription. When the situation was ready, he put out an issue. Sometimes he did not publish an issue for a long time.</p>
<p>For the expounding of the New Testament and the publishing of this exposition for the benefit of the churches and the Lord&rsquo;s children, I made the decision to have two trainings yearly with the help from the trainees and the work of the polishers and the serving ones in the ministry office so that the word of the Lord&rsquo;s truths may be released regularly. This practice helped a lot for the publishing of the interpreted, expounded, and understood Word for seventeen years without any interruption. I consider this as a marvelous environment for the release of God&rsquo;s divine revelation.</p>
<p>I am full of thanks to the Lord for His supply to meet every need. I am also thankful to the Lord that we have been able to have two annual trainings for the last seventeen years without interruption. This has been the Lord&rsquo;s mercy. He has provided us with the marvelous environment for the release of His divine revelation. I am sorry that my senior co-worker, Brother Nee, did not have such an environment.</p>
<p>We have over forty faithful, full-time workers in our three offices in Anaheim, Irving, and Taipei. In addition to these workers, a number of other saints volunteer their time to help us spread the truths. We are serving the churches all over the earth with the publishing and the tape ministries, and we have been doing this for over seventeen years. I thank the Lord that we have such a marvelous environment for the release of His divine revelation. I am thankful to the Lord that much of what I have spoken has been put into print. Even if I die, my word in the Lord still speaks. He has provided us with the marvelous environment for the release of His divine revelation.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Present Charge to Us Should Be:<br />
Go and Teach the Nations That<br />
the Present Age May Be Consummated</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s present charge to us should be: go and teach the nations (cf. Matt. 28:19) that the present age may be consummated (24:14). In order to take the Lord&rsquo;s charge, we must keep the oneness. We must have the one accord. If we lose the oneness and the one accord, we are finished as far as the Lord&rsquo;s move is concerned. I realized the danger of divisions among us over the past ten years. This is why I called at least four urgent elders&rsquo; meetings. I told the brothers that I realized there was the tendency among us toward divisions. This was because some of the brothers wanted to have their own work within the unique work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Eventually, by 1987 my warning was fulfilled, and these divisions came to the surface. The main cause of these divisions was ambition. Some desired to have their own work, and at the same time they pretended to be for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>When the saints go to Europe, they should not touch any of these negative things. We should only go to teach the divine truths. We should teach people about God. We should tell them how the eternal God is triune and how He is perfect and complete as love, light, holiness, and righteousness. Then we can go on to teach them God&rsquo;s economy. In God&rsquo;s economy, He desires to have man as His expression. Thus, He created the heavens for the earth, the earth for man, and man with a spirit to receive Him as life. We need to teach people God&rsquo;s economy, God&rsquo;s desire, God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s purpose. We also need to teach people God&rsquo;s dispensing. We need to tell them how God wants to dispense Himself in His element and essence into our being to make Himself one with us.</p>
<p>We should also teach people about the wonderful process through which the Triune God has passed in order to dispense Himself into us. He was incarnated and lived a human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years. In His living we can see the divine attributes and the human virtues. He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death to deal with Satan, the world, sin, the flesh, the old man, the old creation, and the ordinances. Through His death, on the positive side, He released the divine life and entered into resurrection. In His resurrection, we were resurrected with Him. He became the firstborn Son, and we, through regeneration by Him and with Him, became God&rsquo;s many sons as the members of Christ to constitute His Body. We need to teach people all of these things.</p>
<p>We should also teach people the detailed items of Christ&rsquo;s redemption through His blood. He redeemed us by washing us, forgiving us, justifying us, and reconciling us to God. We also should minister to people the items of God&rsquo;s salvation in the life of Christ, in regenerating us, renewing us, sanctifying us, transforming us, conforming us into His image, and glorifying us in Christ as the glory. The people also need to see all the aspects of the church. They need to eventually see how the one universal church, as the Body of Christ, should be expressed as the local churches in many localities. We need to teach with much stress the truths concerning the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the organic Body of Christ. Eventually, the church will consummate in the New Jerusalem as the ultimate manifestation of the processed Triune God mingled with the transformed tripartite man to express the Triune God to the fullest in eternity. Our teaching of the divine truths should include the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s dispensing. When we go to Europe, we should teach the central line of the divine truth with the main stresses without making any small point an issue for debating or fighting that causes divisions.</p>
<p>In addition to teaching the divine truths, we have to have a complete change from the old, traditional, unscriptural way of meeting and serving to the new, scriptural way. History tells us that whoever changes from the old to the new always gains. The method of transportation has eventually changed from the mule wagon to the airplane. It goes without saying that this change has made travel much easier and more efficient. The Chinese people who left the mainland to live overseas have learned to leave their oldness and pick up the new things. This is what makes them so successful. We also have to have a complete change to the Lord&rsquo;s new way. Time sifts people, so we must have a change.</p>
<p>There have been a number of major changes in the present world. The first change is the formation of the European Common Market. Although England, France, and Germany have disagreed with one another for centuries, they have become members of this Common Market. Second, the satellite countries of Russia have changed their philosophy from atheism and communism to democracy and the Bible. Russia has also changed. Another major change involved the crisis between Iraq and Kuwait and the war that followed. It is amazing that the President of the United States made such a strong decision to deal with Iraq. This dealing turned out for the benefit of Israel and for the putting down of its opposing Arab countries.</p>
<p>While the world situation has been changing, we have also been changing from the old way to the new way, the God-ordained way. We cannot change the truth, but we surely have to change our way to carry out the truth. We all need to change our &ldquo;philosophy.&rdquo; We need to change the way we preach, the way we meet, the way we help people, and the way we have our home meetings and group meetings to match the God-ordained way. Much of what we are now doing is still according to the old &ldquo;philosophy.&rdquo; We need to change our philosophy and give up any confidence in our old way.</p>
<p>The leading ones should not have the confidence that they know how to manage the church. We need to consider how much fruit has been borne by us in our locality. Fruit is the expression and manifestation of life. We may have been in a locality for years with very little fruit, very little increase. Would we take that way to carry on a business? Fruit is a strong proof of where we really are. We need to have a change, not trusting in our old way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INITIAL EXAMPLE OF THE SPREADING OF<br />
THE GOSPEL, INCLUDING THE TRUTHS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Not by the Apostles but by the Migrated Disciples</h2>
<p>Now we need to consider the initial example of the spreading of the gospel, including the truths (Acts 8:1, 4). According to Acts 8, this spreading was not by the apostles but by the migrated disciples. The church in Jerusalem had thousands of believers, but due to persecution, they were all scattered to carry out the spreading of the gospel. The believers were scattered, but the apostles remained. The practice today in Christianity is the opposite; the clergy go and the laymen remain. But the spreading of the gospel according to the initial example in Acts 8 shows the apostles remaining in Jerusalem and the other disciples migrating.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Waiting for the Completion<br />
of the Gospel in the Holy Land</h2>
<p>The disciples sovereignly were scattered to other places without waiting for the completion of the gospel in the Holy Land. Portions of the Holy Land had not yet heard the gospel, but the Lord was still burdened for the disciples to carry the gospel to other places. Acts 8 also speaks of Philip going to Samaria and eventually preaching the gospel to an Ethiopian eunuch for the spread of the divine truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Mentioning of Migration<br />
for the Spreading of the Gospel Being the Basic Principle for the Spreading of the Gospel, Including the Divine Truths</h2>
<p>The scattering of the believers from Jerusalem to other localities is the first mentioning of migration for the spreading of the gospel; hence, it should be considered as the basic principle for the spreading of the gospel, including the divine truths. Regardless of whether or not the divine truths have reached the entire United States, we still need to go to Europe. We also have to believe that our going to Europe will stir up something positive in the United States.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEING THE VISION OF THE LORD IN HIS RECOVERY<br />
AND ANSWERING THE CALL OF HIS CHARGE</h2>
<p>We need to see the vision of the Lord in His recovery and answer the call of His charge (cf. Isa. 6:1, 8).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Our Consecration and Absoluteness<br />
for the Lord Needing to Be Rekindled</h2>
<p>Our consecration and absoluteness for the Lord need to be rekindled. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I still love You. I want to love You more.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rising Up to Follow the Lord in His Present Move<br />
and Having Ourselves Adjusted<br />
to His Regulations to Be Useful to Him</h2>
<p>We should rise up to follow the Lord in His present move and have ourselves adjusted to His regulations to be useful to Him (Dan. 11:32; 2 Tim. 2:21). Daniel 11:32 says, &ldquo;The people who know their God will show strength and take action.&rdquo; To take action means to do something noble and worthy which may be considered as an achievement. Especially in these days in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we need to be those who show strength and take action.</p>
<p>For us to be useful to the Lord, we need to be particularly sanctified and adjusted in many aspects and in many things that we could be a vessel unto honor at this particular time.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO SPREAD<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY<br />
IN THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:25; 11:25; Matt. 18:19-20; Acts 12:12; Rom. 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Heb. 10:24-25; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 31; Rom. 14:1, 3; 15:7; Eph. 4:1-6; 1 Cor. 1:10-13; Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10; Matt. 20:25-27; 23:8-11; 1 Pet. 5:5</h1>
<p>In the previous chapter, we saw our responsibility for the spreading of the divine truths. A great part of the divine truths we have received from the Bible are based upon the light the Brethren received in the nineteenth century. Those who know the Bible recognize that the best theology is Brethren theology. The notes in the reference Bible written by Dr. C. I. Scofield are mostly from the teachings of the Brethren. This Bible was very popular in the early part of this century. Based upon the help we received from the Brethren, the Lord has gone on in His present recovery to show us many more divine truths. We need to pick up the burden to spread these truths to the crucial parts of the world.</p>
<p>In this chapter we want to see the way to spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the countries of Europe. A recent article in <em>The San Francisco Chronicle</em> quoted Dr. J. Gordon Melton&rsquo;s word which said, &ldquo;New religious movements are finding fertile soil in Europe where low church attendance and a changing world order have led to a search for spiritual alternatives.&rdquo; This shows that some need to go to Europe to meet the real need of the seeking ones with the divine truths from the holy Word. After the four-day, four-hour war with Iraq, I received a burden to &ldquo;invade&rdquo; Europe with the divine truths of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT BY A WORK NOR BY A MOVEMENT<br />
BUT BY EMIGRATION</h2>
<p>We need to see how to carry out the spread of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the countries of Europe. Our going to Europe should be neither by a work nor by a movement but by emigration.</p>
<p>Europe has changed, and the people there are looking for something new. Thus, we should go there in an absolutely new way with nothing traditional. Recently, I was wondering why we have had to pass through so much opposition, persecution, and even rebellion in these past seven and a half years since 1984. I believe that I received the answer. The Lord has prepared us during these seven and a half years to get a new way to meet the new need in Europe. Before 1984 we would not have been able to go to Europe with something new in practice. We could only have gone there with the old, traditional way of meeting and serving. In these recent years, I have put out many messages on the God-ordained way. Thus, while the Lord has been preparing Europe, He has used the same period of time, the last seven and a half years, to prepare us in His way of meeting and service as revealed in the New Testament.</p>
<p>Due to the recent changes in Europe, the people there are ready to receive something new from the West. We should not go there with our old &ldquo;philosophy,&rdquo; our old way. In the previous chapter, I begged us to have a change in our &ldquo;philosophy.&rdquo; The young people there do not want any old element of Christianity. They want something new. We need to go to Europe with the Lord&rsquo;s new way, the God-ordained way. We should go to Europe by emigration, not by a work or by a movement. We will be warmly welcomed because the people there want to receive new things from the Western world. Some of the young people in eastern Berlin begged the brothers to send people there to teach them the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Some Emigrating There to Live the Lord<br />
and Serve the Lord Full-time</h2>
<p>Some can emigrate to Europe to live the Lord and serve the Lord full-time. We should go there to live Christ and serve Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Some Emigrating There to Take a Job or<br />
Do a Business and Serve the Lord</h2>
<p>Some can emigrate there to take a job or do a business and serve the Lord. One brother reported that one of the best businesses for the American brothers in Eastern Europe is the remodeling of old houses. This is because the houses there are very old and in need of much work.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Some Emigrating There<br />
to Study in a School and Serve the Lord</h2>
<p>Some can emigrate there to study in a school and serve the Lord. I would recommend that some go there to be &ldquo;professional students.&rdquo; In other words, those who go to school should plan on remaining in school for the Lord&rsquo;s work on the campuses. The longer they stay in school, the better it is. This is because they can spend their time contacting the students for the Lord&rsquo;s interest. I hope that many young people among us would go to the universities in Europe to be professional students teaching the divine truths. It is glorious and worthwhile to be such a student, contacting other students daily with the Lord&rsquo;s truths. I believe that some students who go to Europe can bear new fruit monthly like the tree of life in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">All Being Burdened by the Lord and<br />
Having a Clear Guidance from the Lord</h2>
<p>All those who want to go to Europe should be burdened by the Lord and have a clear guidance from the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">GOING MAINLY TO EAST GERMANY<br />
AND RUSSIA IN THE FIRST STEP</h2>
<p>Initially, I considered that we should go to Europe in the first step to Great Britain, France, Germany, and Russia. But after receiving reports from the brothers who traveled to Europe, I realized that our main goal should be eastern Germany and western Russia. Although we will mainly concentrate on eastern Germany and western Russia, this does not mean that no one should go to Great Britain, France, or western Germany. Furthermore, we should realize that Great Britain is very crucial for the Lord&rsquo;s move throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Today all of Russia is open to our publications. We should not lose the opportunity to fill Russia with our writings. We are looking to the Lord for the publishing of one million copies, as proposed by some Russian brothers to us, of each of the six books we mentioned in chapter one&mdash;<em>The Normal Christian Life, The Spiritual Man, The Experience of Life, The Knowledge of Life, The Economy of God</em>, and <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy.</em> I hope that we would pray for this.</p>
<p>I expected that we would initially have forty saints who would be willing to be trained in the fall for emigrating to Europe, but thus far more than one hundred seventy have signed up for going to Europe. We hope that the saints who are burdened and will be trained in the fall will be able to leave for Europe by January 1992. By that time some of the books in different languages will be prepared. We hope to teach the trainees a foreign language by means of a particular book from the ministry which we will compose in English and translate into that language. In this way they will be able to pick up the spiritual vocabulary, and they can go to Europe to speak to the people with the truths from the book they have studied.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Emigrate to the Leading Cities That Have Colleges or Universities for Us to Work On</h2>
<p>We are burdened to emigrate to the leading cities that have colleges and universities for us to work on. We are doing research so that we can find all the leading universities in Europe for our emigration there.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Go in a Team of<br />
at Least Four Saints, Including a Couple<br />
between the Ages of Thirty and Fifty,<br />
in Whose Home the Meetings Will Begin</h2>
<p>We are burdened to go to Europe in a team of at least four saints, including a couple between the ages of thirty to fifty, in whose home the meetings will begin. Every team of saints going to Europe should have a couple, and this couple may have some children. This family will be the center of the team. We will try to help them to get a home close to a college or a university. Hopefully, this home will be big enough for keeping two or three guests. It could serve as a place for some emigrating saints to stay until they can become properly situated. The newly-contacted people can be brought to this home for fellowship. This will be our way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO LIVE, TO WORK, TO SERVE, AND TO MEET</h2>
<h2 class="head2">To Live a Life in Resurrection under the Cross</h2>
<p>Now we want to see the way to live, to work, to serve, and to meet. First, we need to live a life in resurrection under the cross. To live in resurrection is to live in the Spirit of Christ, who is the reality of the resurrection of Christ, and to live under the cross is to experience the death of Christ in our union with Him in His Spirit for the denying of ourselves and our flesh and for the rejection of the world and its influence.</p><h2 class="head2">To Work by Contacting People in Preaching<br />
the High Gospel, in Teaching the Deeper Truths, and in Testifying the Christian Experience</h2>
<p>We also need to work by contacting people in preaching the high gospel, in teaching the deeper truths, and in testifying the Christian experience. We should always practice to contact people one by one. We should not try to preach to a group. We may speak to fifty persons at one time, but eventually we may gain none of these fifty. The most effective way is to contact people one by one.</p>
<p>We need to preach the high gospel. We should not be influenced by the old concept that people will not understand us if we share things that are deep and high. The thoughtful people want to hear the deeper truths concerning the real meaning of human life.</p>
<p>It is possible that we could share with someone about Genesis 1 in the deepest way. We could ask them to read this chapter with us. Then we could say, &ldquo;Here it says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The first thing God did was to call light into being, and then God made the air. Later, God caused the dry land to appear for the existence of the plants, the animals, and man. He created man in His image according to His likeness. In Genesis 1 we see the plant life, the animal life, and the human life, but this is not the highest life. The highest life is seen in the next chapter, and that is the tree of life. For our existence we need the light, the air, and the land, but we are also human beings in God&rsquo;s image according to God&rsquo;s likeness. God&rsquo;s intention is for us to have His life.&rdquo; We can then grasp the opportunity to ask them to pray with us and call on the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>If we shared the truth from Genesis 1 with them in such a way, they would wonder where we learned all these things. We can tell them, &ldquo;I was a Christian for years and I did not know these things. But one day I read a message which pointed out all these things in Genesis 1.&rdquo; This will lead them into a further seeking of the divine truths. The next time we see them, we could fellowship with them about the tree of life.</p>
<p>We can speak the high gospel to people from any part of the Bible. It is even possible to preach the gospel from the beginning of Matthew 1. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.&rdquo; From this point, we can say something about Christ. Then we can proceed by telling the stories about David and Abraham. We can eventually arrive at the point of the Lord Jesus being the Redeemer and the Savior.</p>
<p>We all have to learn the truths. The entire New Testament has been expounded by us, so we have to study this exposition. From the middle of August to the middle of December, we will have a special four-month training to equip the burdened ones to go to Europe. This equipping will mainly be accomplished by an intensified study of the Life-study messages. After the saints have applied for this four-month training, there will be a process of being accepted to the training, being educated, being trained, and eventually passing the training. All of us need to study the divine truths in the printed ministry to equip us for the preaching of the high gospel.</p>
<p>We should fully abandon the old, traditional, natural way of preaching the gospel. We must have a change to the scriptural, uplifted way of preaching the gospel. Even the way of teaching mathematics has been absolutely changed from the way of teaching years ago. In order to teach the truths properly, we need to get ourselves qualified. We may feel that we need a lot of time to become qualified, but we do not need that much time. The special four-month training we will have from August through December will help us to become qualified. We may feel that we cannot make it, but the training will help us to make it.</p>
<p>We need to be equipped to teach the deeper truths of God&rsquo;s economy to those in Europe. Most in Christianity do not know the high gospel or the deeper truths. Furthermore, because of the clergy-laity system, they have not been trained to function as living members of the Body of Christ. We need to change our way. The clergy-laity system offends the Lord because it annuls the use of the members of Christ. The Lord wants every member of the entire Body of Christ to work, to function.</p>
<p>The traditional way of Christianity with one man speaking and the rest listening kills the members of the Body of Christ. All the saints can speak for the Lord. To oppose the God- ordained way is to oppose the Lord. The clergy-laity system of Christianity annuls the ability, capacity, gifts, and functions of the saints. When we go to Europe, we need to forget about serving in the way of one person speaking to a congregation. Instead, we should spend our time contacting people one by one. Then we can bring the ones helped by us to a home of the saints near the campus. Spontaneously, we will nourish the ones under our care. We will obey the Lord&rsquo;s charge to feed His lambs.</p>
<p>I would ask the leading ones to consider their situation. We may have been managing the church for years with little result. Should we not have a change? Today Taiwan makes much money because they have changed much within the last twenty years. We need the training. The training helps us to change.</p><h2 class="head2">To Serve in the Spirit<br />
according to the Divine Revelation</h2>
<p>We also need to serve in the Spirit according to the divine revelation. In the past, did we serve in the Spirit according to the Scriptures? The Spirit surely did not guide us and lead us to serve in the old, traditional, and unscriptural way of meeting and serving. We have to change our way to the new way of meeting and serving. Human culture changes and advances as time goes on, and people need to change to live in this culture. By saying that we need to change, I do not mean that we have to follow the world or fashion ourselves according to the world.</p>
<p>In our work to spread the divine truths, we should always serve in the Spirit. Before I minister the word, I always take some time to pray, &ldquo;Lord, here I am again. You must fill me up with Yourself. You must infuse me with Your desire, with Your intention, with Your feeling, with Your thought, with Your word, Your utterance, and Your expression. Fill me, Lord, and pour Yourself out upon me to be my impact. I don&rsquo;t want to speak just by myself. I want to speak in You as in one spirit with You. I pray that You would speak in my speaking.&rdquo; We need to serve in the Spirit in such a way.</p>
<p>Our serving in the Spirit should also be according to the divine revelation in the Scriptures. We should consider how the Bible tells us to preach the gospel. The scriptural way is to preach the gospel by contacting people one by one. Then we need to be like nursing mothers to feed the new ones (1 Thes. 2:7) and like teaching fathers to raise them up in home meetings (2:11). We also need to have group meetings to perfect them so that they can do the work of the New Testament ministry as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers do (Eph. 4:12). We also need to have larger church meetings, encouraging everybody to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:23-25, 31). This is the biblical way.</p>
<p>We all need to function as priests of the gospel. We have seen the truth revealed in Romans 15:16 concerning the priesthood of the gospel. In this verse Paul said that he was a priest of the gospel of God, presenting the saved nations as sacrifices to God. Preaching the gospel is not merely a matter of getting sinners saved or of winning souls; it is a matter of gaining sacrifices to offer to God. When we go out, we must serve in the Spirit according to the Scriptures as priests of the gospel of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">To Meet according to the God-ordained Way<br />
as Revealed in the New Testament</h2>
<p>We need to meet according to the God-ordained way as revealed in the New Testament, fully in mutuality, avoiding the one-man ministry, and abhorring the system of clergy and laity, for worshipping God, remembering the Lord, praying, saving sinners, feeding the new believers, perfecting the saints, and building up the church as the organic Body of Christ, without any element of the traditional way, formality, and ritual (1 Cor. 14:25; 11:25; Matt. 18:19-20; Acts 12:12; Rom. 15:16; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; Heb. 10:24-25; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 31). We need to study the truth concerning the God-ordained way. We have published many messages on the God-ordained way, and we need to read these messages.</p>
<p>The God-ordained way of meeting is in mutuality not in plurality. In the eldership we should have plurality, that is, a number of elders. But the church meetings are not a matter of plurality but of mutuality. We may arrange to have ten or twenty speak in the meeting. This is plurality. But when the meeting is open for everybody to speak, this is mutuality. I speak, and you listen; then you speak, and I listen. This is mutuality. Mutuality, not plurality, is the biblical way. The biblical way is for the church meetings to be open for everybody to function.</p>
<p>We have to practice all the aspects of the God-ordained way. Then we will be qualified to go to Europe. Europe has changed and is still changing. The people there will not accept anything old. Many of them have dropped atheism and communism. They like democracy and they want to know the things concerning God as the Bible reveals, but they do not want any kind of empty religion. This is why we have to learn to minister Christ to people according to the God-ordained way revealed in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE MATTER<br />
OF FELLOWSHIP WITH THE SAINTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In Our Meetings, Which Are Grounded on the<br />
Unique Oneness of the Body of Christ, Receiving<br />
All Real Believers in Christ without Any Terms</h2>
<p>In our meetings, which are grounded on the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, we receive all real believers in Christ without any terms (Rom. 14:1, 3; 15:7). Any term or condition added to the faith in Christ, which is the unique term for us to be members of Christ, causes divisions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Attending, if Necessary, the Christian Meetings<br />
Which are Grounded on the Unique Oneness<br />
of the Body of Christ, without<br />
Trying to Adjust, Correct, or Improve<br />
the Way of Their Service and Meeting</h2>
<p>We should attend, if necessary, the Christian meetings which are grounded on the unique oneness of the Body of Christ, without trying to adjust, correct, or improve the way of their service and meeting. We should avoid going to other meetings that are not grounded on the unique oneness of the Body of Christ. We should go to Europe to have a new start with the Lord&rsquo;s new way. Our time is short, so we should spend it to contact people in a new way with the high gospel, the deeper truths, and the Christian experience.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE SUPPLY OF OUR NECESSITIES</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Full-Timers Living a Life by Faith,<br />
Trusting in the Lord for Their Necessities,<br />
and Receiving the Lord&rsquo;s Supply<br />
through the Saints and the Churches</h2>
<p>The full-timers should live a life by faith, trusting in the Lord for their necessities and receiving the Lord&rsquo;s supply through the saints and the churches. If we feel led and burdened by the Lord to go full-time, we should not worry about our necessities. We have to believe in the Lord and put our trust in Him. We should not think that we will have a prosperous life in material things. We must get ourselves prepared to suffer. The first suffering is poverty. We need to learn to serve the Lord in poverty. Some think that if they serve the Lord in poverty, that is a sign they have not been chosen and called by the Lord. However, the apostle Paul was in poverty (2 Cor. 6:10; 11:27). Because the churches established by him did not adequately support him, he was forced to make tents (Acts 18:3). At the same time, he ministered to the needs of his co-workers (20:34).</p>
<p>When I was called by the Lord to serve Him full-time, I thought that He had just called me to preach the gospel to my countrymen in the villages. I told the Lord that as long as I could have water to drink and food to eat, I would be satisfied. I never thought the Lord would bring me to the big cities of mainland China and eventually to Taiwan and the United States. In 1961 I came to the United States with the intention of staying here for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. At that time I had just a little amount of cash on hand to meet my need. However, the Lord supplied me with enough for my necessities. The Lord is faithful to meet all our needs when we follow Him and His calling.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, I have learned how to be abased in poverty and how to abound (Phil. 4:12). If we have the money, we should learn to save some for others and for the needs of the churches. To serve the Lord in this way is glorious. If the Lord has called us and sent us, He will surely take care of us. He has a way to supply us through the saints and the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not as Being Hired in Any Sense<br />
by Anyone or by Any Church</h2>
<p>When we serve the Lord, we should not have the thought that we are hired in any sense by anyone or by any church. If the church supplies us, that does not mean that the church hires us. That is not a wage but the Lord&rsquo;s supply through the church. We have to fully realize that the Lord in supporting us needs His Body (the church) and the members of His Body (the believers) to cooperate with Him. He does not supply us directly by Himself but indirectly through His Body and His members.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
AND MAINTAINING A GOOD ORDER<br />
IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We need to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ and maintain a good order in the Body of Christ so that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery can be kept to go on in the proper way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Keeping the Unique Oneness of the Body of Christ<br />
Locally and Universally</h2>
<p>We should always endeavor to keep the unique oneness of the Body of Christ locally and universally (Eph. 4:1-6). This should be the prerequisite of our remaining in the recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Condemning Any Kind of Division</h2>
<p>According to 1 Corinthians 1:10-13, we must condemn any kind of division.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Turning Away from Those Who Make Divisions</h2>
<p>We also must turn away from those who make divisions (Rom. 16:17; Titus 3:10). This is why I published the book entitled <em>The Fermentation of the Present Rebellion.</em> Because some are sick, full of the germs of division, they need to be quarantined. This is according to Romans 16:17, where Paul charges us to turn away from those who make divisions. If we do not turn away from them, we will be infected with the same disease of division. To turn away from such ones is for our preservation. According to Titus 3:10, a factious, divisive person should be refused, rejected, after a first and second admonition in order to keep the oneness of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Maintaining a Good Order in the Body of Christ</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, on the one hand, we should keep the oneness of the Body of Christ, and on the other hand, we should maintain a good order in the Body of Christ. For the Lord&rsquo;s recovery to remain in a proper condition, we need both the oneness and a good order.</p>
<h2 class="head3">By Abandoning Any Kind of Dictatorship</h2>
<p>We must maintain a good order in the Body of Christ by abandoning any kind of dictatorship (Matt. 20:25-27; 23:8-11). According to Matthew 20 and 23, we all are brothers. There is no rank among us. Ambition for higher rank in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must be fully killed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">By Subjecting Ourselves One to Another</h2>
<p>We abandon any kind of dictatorship, but we maintain a good order in the Body of Christ by subjecting ourselves one to another (1 Pet. 5:5). Even the older ones should subject themselves to the younger ones. We have God as our Father, and we have Christ as our Lord and Head. This indicates that we should be a submissive people. Although we are all brothers, Paul told us that we should obey the ones leading us and submit to them (Heb. 13:17). The church is not an anarchy, but on the other hand, in the church the elders should not lord it over the saints (1 Pet. 5:3). There needs to be a good order in the church. According to 1 Peter 5:5, the younger men should be subject to elders, which includes all older men. The young people among us need to practice this. The elders among us, on the other hand, should have no attitude or feeling of superiority. We need a good and beautiful order in the church, with all being subject to one another in the fear of Christ (Eph. 5:21).</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A SPECIAL TRAINING FOR FOUR MONTHS<br />
TO PREPARE AND EQUIP THE BURDENED ONES,<br />
INCLUDING FULL-TIMERS, THOSE WITH A JOB<br />
OR A BUSINESS, AND STUDENTS,<br />
IN THE FOLLOWING MATTERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">In Foreign Languages</h2>
<p>We will have a special training for four months to prepare and equip the burdened ones in foreign languages. These languages at first will be German and Russian. The more languages we can learn, the more useful we can be in the spread of the divine truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Divine Truths</h2>
<p>We will also prepare and equip those who are burdened to go to Europe with an intensive study of the divine truths.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Manner of Life</h2>
<p>This special training will prepare the burdened ones in the manner of life. The brothers among us need to learn to dress properly, as those who live Christ. If a high-ranking person invited us to his home for dinner, we would surely go properly and appropriately dressed. We need to realize that the One who has invited us to the church meetings is the Lord Jesus. He is there waiting for us in the meeting. Therefore, we should dress properly when we attend the meetings. The brothers should wear a proper tie and comb their hair properly. They should also shine their shoes regularly. We should not be worldly, but on the other hand, we should be comely and neat. We should pray about how to cut and style our hair. The sisters, especially, need to do this. The appearance of the sisters means a lot. A sister in Christ should be comely in a proper way, remembering that she is one who fears God, worships God, lives Christ, and ministers Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Personal Contacting of People</h2>
<p>The special training will also help the burdened ones in the personal contacting of people. We have to learn to be polite when we contact people. We need to learn how to sit before people, especially before someone who is older than we are. We should also be very proper in contacting those of the other sex. The sisters should remember their position in the Lord as females. If we behave ourselves properly in our contact with people, this will open the door for the gospel and the deeper truths. Otherwise, the door will be shut. Again, this shows that we need a change. We need the training.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE ONE ACCORD</h2>
<p>Finally, nothing is more crucial, vital, or valuable than the one accord for keeping the oneness. We must always endeavor to keep the oneness by practicing the one accord. We should always practice going along with others, not insisting on our way of doing things. We should not be &ldquo;back-seat drivers&rdquo; in the church life who are full of opinions. This does not mean that we should drop our discernment. When I do things by myself, I will take the top way. But when I go with others, I will take their way. We should learn to do this.</p>
<p>We also need to learn to teach the divine truths in the central lane of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. I served the Lord with Brother Nee for eighteen years, and we never had any discrepancy in our teaching concerning Christ and the church in the central lane of God&rsquo;s economy. In our teachings we always practiced the one accord.</p>
<p>If we open to the Lord and receive the fellowship in this book, I believe we will be blessed, we will enjoy the Lord to the uttermost, and we will be a living testimony to the people of Europe.</p></body></html>
