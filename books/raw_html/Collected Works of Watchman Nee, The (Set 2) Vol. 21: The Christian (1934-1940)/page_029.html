<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Question of Fasting</H2><P>When the Lord Jesus said this, the Pharisees immediately raised a question. They did not care if they were sick or well. They wanted to say what they said because they had judged that the Lord Jesus and His disciples were gluttons. They asked why the Pharisees and the disciples of John fasted (fasting being exactly the opposite of feasting), but the Lord's disciples did not fast. They fasted, but the Lord's disciples did not fast. Here was a difference.</P><P>What is the meaning of fasting? According to the tone of those who asked the question, fasting meant two things to them. The first kind of fasting was one in which they ate five days out of a week and did not eat the other two days. The Lord's disciples, in contrast, ate all seven days of the week. This is the literal meaning of fasting. But there is a second meaning. They were religious in their background. Their background was excellent. They were not like the Lord's disciples, who enjoyed whatever was before them. They had good works according to their religion and were able to achieve what men found hard to achieve. This is like Chinese ascetics who cultivate themselves by suffering. It is also like the vegetarians who extol vegetarianism. The Pharisees were even more "noble"; they even refrained from eating. They seemed to have achieved the virtues that ordinary men were not able to achieve. We can see these two meanings here. One said that they fasted while the Lord's disciples did not fast. The other said that they were able to achieve all that the flesh could achieve and had gained for themselves the name of godliness and service to God. They seemed to be saying, "We do all these. Why are Your disciples not doing the same?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Reason for Not Fasting</H2><P>Since there were two implications in their question, the Lord's answer was divided into two parts. The first part was an answer according to the literal meaning of the word. He said that the sons of the bridechamber cannot mourn while the bridegroom is with them. He meant that He was the Bridegroom and that the disciples were the sons of the bridechamber. While the Bridegroom was there, the sons of the bridechamber did not need to fast. This pointed out to the Pharisees why the disciples did not fast. They did not have to fast because the Lord Jesus was not yet "taken away" (Luke 5:35). After He was taken away, His disciples would have to fast. Before the Lord was rejected and crucified, the disciples did not have to fast. After He was rejected and crucified, the disciples would have to fast. This was the Lord's answer according to the literal meaning of the question on fasting. In the second answer, the Lord used five parables to explain the reason that the new and the old cannot be mixed together. These five parables are: (1) the impossibility of patching an old garment with unfulled cloth; (2) the impossibility of patching an old garment with a patch from a new garment; (3) the impossibility of putting new wine in old wineskins; (4) the need for new wine to be put in new wineskins; and (5) "no one who has drunk the old desires the new, for he says, The old is better." Why did the Lord use these five parables? The Pharisees thought that they ought to do good, have religious works, try their best to keep God's commandments, and please God. The Lord told them that the literal fasting could come to His disciples only after He had departed from them. But if fasting refers to good works, there should not be any fasting even after He has left the disciples. That kind of fasting would be useless even after the Lord left them. The Lord used these five parables to show the Pharisees that the things He brought in were completely incompatible with the ordinances and ceremonies of the law. The grace which He brought in was absolutely incompatible with the law. The five parables signify that the law and grace can never be mixed. If they are mixed together, the law will no longer be the law, and grace will no longer be grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE UNFULLED CLOTH AND THE OLD GARMENT</H2><P>Matthew 9:16 says, "No one puts a patch of unfulled cloth on an old garment, for that which fills it up pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear is made." Here the Lord shows us a parable concerning the unfulled cloth and the old garment. These are common things which we see all the time. But the Lord has much to say about them. If one puts unfulled cloth on an old garment, the unfulled cloth will pull away from the old garment, and the tear in the old garment will become worse. What does a garment in the Bible signify? It signifies our righteousness before God. In this parable, it is taken for granted that the garment is torn already. This means that all of our garments are torn. The Lord does not say that this is a new garment; the old garment is torn. All old garments are torn garments. Every person, male or female, young or old, rich or poor, noble or mean, is a piece of torn garment in the eyes of God. Friends, you have to remember that every one of us is a sinner before God. I am afraid that many Christians (I speak only of Christians, and not of others) are willing to admit that everyone in the world is a sinner, but do not realize the seriousness of such a word. Many Christians are willing to admit that Genesis 3 is the beginning of man's fall. But they have not seen the seriousness of such a word. Our garments are torn. Yet we have not seen our raggedness.</P><P>What is the meaning of a torn garment? This verse is not speaking of putting on many garments such as vests and jackets. If so, an outward garment could be torn, and the inner garments could still be whole. Here there is only one garment. When this garment is torn, the flesh is exposed. In other words, our shame is exposed. While you are sitting here, you may feel comfortable and at peace. (When we leave our home, we often ask our father or wife if our dress is proper. Most likely you have asked such questions before. We want others, especially those around us, to see that our dress is proper.) But there is One who is in secret, yet who is in the light, who sees you everywhere, and who says that your garment is torn. You cannot hide your sin and shame. Your past history is filled with filth and sin, and you will never tell others about them. These things are hidden in your heart and held under your tongue. Yet you cannot hide yourself before God. God is speaking through the mouth of His Son that your garment is torn. Under the light of the law, your righteousness is a torn garment; it cannot cover your shame before God. It is not a question of whether or not your garment is torn; it is already torn. There is, however, a question of what we should do about it. Suppose it is summer, and your garment is torn. What are you going to do? If you do not know that your garment is torn, you will not feel ashamed. But if someone tells you that your garment is torn two inches along the seam, how will you feel? You cannot cover it with your handkerchief or with your hat. While you ride on the bus, you cannot cover it with your umbrella. You feel ashamed and want to run home immediately to change your clothes. You will not think about doing something else or visiting your friend and, therefore, not go home. You will want to go home immediately to mend it or change into another garment. You have been sunk in your sin for twenty, thirty, or even fifty years, and your garment is torn. Do you feel the shame? You may think that since others do not see it and God does not see it, you can get by easily. But there is not such a thing. Your garment is torn, and the only way you have is to mend it. Let us see what the Lord Jesus says about the mending. In the past, we did not pay much attention to this matter. But during the past few weeks, I have been paying special attention to this passage. The word unfulled in Greek does not mean something new; rather, it means something unfinished. An unfulled cloth means a piece of cloth that has not been bleached, dyed, ironed, or starched. It is an unfulled cloth, not an unfulled garment. Although it is a piece of cloth, the process is not yet complete; it is still unfulled. Why did the Lord use this word? This kind of cloth ruins the old garment. Anything new is from the Lord Jesus. Anything that we have is natural and old. Friends, do we see what is being shown to us here? Many have received something of the Lord Jesus, but they have not received the work of the Lord Jesus in full. They have the outward name of being a Christian, but they have not received the accomplished work of the Lord Jesus on the cross. If you ask many people who Jesus Christ is, they say that He was a great Teacher. Many nominal Christians say that Jesus was a great model of love and equality, and that we have to imitate Him so that the world can become the kingdom of heaven, the kingdom of heaven can be brought to earth, and the world can evolve into a golden age. This is the message of "preachers without the blood." Friends, this is unfulled cloth. This cloth is not bought from the fabric store; it is a patch cut out and stolen from the factory; it is unfinished cloth that is being used to mend the torn garment.</P>
