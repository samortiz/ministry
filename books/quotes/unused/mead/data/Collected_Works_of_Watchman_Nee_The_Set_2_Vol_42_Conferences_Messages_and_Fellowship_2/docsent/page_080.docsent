   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN BRIEF EXPOSITION ON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SECTIONS OF EPHESIANS Date: December 20, 1936, morning</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place: Pu-Chien-Ding, Foochow INTRODUCTION</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of all the Epistles of Paul, the book of Ephesians touches the highest pinnacle of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This book can be divided into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first section covers chapter one through chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It emphasizes the facts which we hold in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The second section covers chapter four to chapter six, verse 9.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It speaks of the things in Christ and how they are applied to man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third section covers chapter six, verse 10 to the end of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In addition to what we have obtained in Christ and what is applied to men, this section speaks of the attacks from Satan and the way to withstand him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not going to do a detailed study of the book of Ephesians today.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will only consider the spiritual principles revealed in the book.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ephesians 2:6 says that we are "seated" with the Lord in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word sit is the key word in the first section.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 4:1 says that we should "walk" worthily of the calling with which we were called.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word walk is the key word in the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ephesians 6:13 says that everything is done, and that we have to "stand."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word stand is the key word in the third section.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every time we read the Bible we should pay attention to these three things: what God has gained, what man has gained, and what Satan has lost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If our position in Christ is right, our living before men will also be right, and we will also be right before Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible shows us that the basis for us to be right before men and Satan rests in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can walk rightly before men because we have received our fullness in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are able to stand and defeat Satan because we are firmly established in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No other person in the Bible spoke like Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most people concentrate on what they can do; their focus is on man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, man can never meet the demands placed upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What he says is one thing, and what he does is another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In fact, what he does is often contrary to what he says.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, Paul said that before there was the law concerning covetousness, he did not know coveting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But once the law came, coveting also came Rom 7:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to Paul's message, we can do something only because God has done it first.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The outstanding thing about the gospel is that God's Son worked first, after which we work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A doctor once told a nurse to give a patient some instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The nurse twice had to tell the doctor that the patient would not cooperate.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the doctor went himself, the patient said, "It is not that I will not do it, but that I cannot do it."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was extremely weak mentally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The doctor came back and said, "It is not that he cannot or that he will not.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is at the point that he cannot will."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only was he short of the outward power to do the thing, he did not have the inward power to will to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He did not even have the inclination to will to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What makes the gospel so distinct is that God has first done something for man, after which, man does it accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Figuratively speaking, God has not asked you to earn money to feed yourself; He has put money into your pocket already.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>With His money you can buy food.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you still do not buy food, it means that you are really hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God has done His work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you still say that you cannot make it, it is not because you cannot make it, but because you choose not make it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ephesians 1 3 speaks of the facts we have in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Afterwards, chapters four through six speak of our walk in this world and our responsibility before Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is Paul's message and his method.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>First he tells us what God has done, and then he tells us what we should do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For the past ten years I have only practiced God's way and Paul's way, which is presenting our position in Christ and then dealing with our daily walk and standing firm against God's enemy according to this position.</S>
