<P>X."In it he had rested from all his work which God created and made" (Gen. 2:1-3). The heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. God's redemptive work had been accomplished. Now there was nothing left to do but rest.</P><P>In chapter one God spoke more than ten times. Whatever was spoken was now finished. The word of God worked in every stage. He spoke every time. Each of God's works shows the development of His intrinsic power. Step by step, they show forth His divine power for the carrying out of His divine plan. "We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works" (Eph. 2:10). Blessed are they who are obedient to the whole scope of the word of God. Seven times God said, "It was good," but the last time, He said, "Very good." His heart was satisfied with the work he had patiently and carefully done. Because He was satisfied, He rested. This is God's rest. This brings us to the new heaven and new earth, the age of eternal rest. At that time, we will enter into God's rest (Heb. 4:3). "He who has entered into His rest has himself also rested from his works, as God did from His own" (Heb. 4:10). Eternity will begin, and during those millions of endless days we shall rest before God and shall be in Him, understanding His will, marveling at His lovingkindness, and praising His grace. What a situation that will be! "Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard and which have not come up in man's heart; things which God has prepared for those who love Him" (1 Cor. 2:9).</P><P>Praise the Lord, because we do not need to wait for the future to have that rest. Even now we can have a foretaste of this rest. "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" (Matt. 11:28-29). Here there are two rests. The first we receive when we believe in the Lord Jesus as our Savior. The second we receive when we learn of the Lord Jesus. Our souls are full of passion, excitement, covetousness, sadness, irritation, and grief. But when we consider the meekness and lowliness of the Lord, how He endured such contradiction of sinners against Himself, how He took the yoke upon Himself, and how he showed Himself as an example of a lamb, then we will no longer be weary and faint. If we learn of Him, we will find rest for our souls, a peaceful life, a life that does not strive, and a life that appreciates the will of God! What a joy!</P><P>In all of the six days, there was "the evening and the morning." After evening there was always morning, yet there was not a day with no evening. But the seventh day, God's Sabbath day, has neither evening nor morning. Now all we have is an endless "day" (different from morning) which is perfect, full, glorious, blessed, and sanctified by God.</P><P>The creation of the physical world is a type of spiritual development. The history of the creation of the material world consists of ten stages, both past and future; but all these stages can be experienced by the believers, although some of these experiences will have their complete fulfillment in the future. "Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, that He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish" (Eph. 5:25-27).</P><P>How simple and how clear are these matters that we have just mentioned! Whoever wants to understand this lesson must apprehend the voices uttered through creation. The works of God's hand are testimonies of God; they express His deep thoughts and His great love. Creation and redemption are two prongs of God's work; they silently speak forth God Himself. Christ is the key to all the Scriptures. We are not distorting the Scriptures, chopping off the toes to fit the shoe. God has ordained that the Scripture should testify of Himself, of Christ and His redemption. If there is any error in this message, it is only due to clumsy writing which fails to convey its intended meaning.</P>
