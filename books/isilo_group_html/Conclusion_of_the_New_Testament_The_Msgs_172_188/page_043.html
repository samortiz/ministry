In Luke 21:36 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Be watchful, at every time beseeching, that you may prevail to escape all these things which are about to take place, and to stand before the Son of Man.&#8221; In Greek &#8220;to stand&#8221; in this verse is in the passive voice. Hence, it has the meaning of being put in a certain place. This refers to our being raptured to the presence of Christ. Furthermore, &#8220;to stand before the Son of Man&#8221; corresponds to the standing of those in Revelation 14:1. It indicates that the raptured overcomers will stand before the Savior on mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation. At the time of the rapture of the living overcomers, Christ will not yet have left heaven to come down to the air. Therefore, the minority of those who are taken, the living overcomers, will stand before the Son of Man in the heavens.<h2 class=head4>(2) To Escape All the Things of the Great Tribulation</h2><p>In Luke 21:36 the Lord Jesus speaks of our prevailing &#8220;to escape all these things which are about to take place.&#8221; &#8220;All these things&#8221; are the things of the great tribulation. The word &#8220;escape&#8221; signifies being taken, raptured, before the great tribulation. Here the Lord promises that if we are watchful and beseeching so that we may overcome to escape (or, are counted worthy to escape) the coming tribulation, we shall be raptured to, will be placed in, His presence.<h2 class=head4>(3) To Be Kept Out of the Hour of Trial Which Is about to Come on the Whole Inhabited Earth, to Try Them Who Dwell on the Earth, That Is, Kept Out of the Time of the Great Tribulation</h2><p>In Revelation 3:10 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&#8221; &#8220;Trial&#8221; in this verse undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). The Lord promises the overcoming believers that He will keep them &#8220;out of the hour of trial&#8221; (not just out of the trial but out of the hour of trial) because they have kept the word of His endurance, the word of His suffering. This promise of the Lord, like His promise in Luke 21:36, indicates that the believers who have kept the word of the Lord&#8217;s endurance will be raptured before the great tribulation. This implies that those who have not kept the word of His endurance will be left in the tribulation. Therefore, to be kept out of the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth, is to be kept out of the time of the great tribulation.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 172-188) &nbsp; pg 43</div><br></body></html>
