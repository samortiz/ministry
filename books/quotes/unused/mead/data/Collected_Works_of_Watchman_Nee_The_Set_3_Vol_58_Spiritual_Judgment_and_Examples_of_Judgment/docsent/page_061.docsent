   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 41 Date:August 20, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER W. M.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a Buddhist family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My mother was a vegetarian for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later a Western missionary invited her to hear the gospel, and both she and I were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Afterwards I became an elder in a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Still later I went to Shanghai and heard Brother Nee, who said that when we come to meetings, we should not only come for sermons, but we should come to pray as well.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I listened to the brothers praying, but I dared not pray myself, and I did not know anything about prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was not even that clear about my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Three brothers in northern Kiangsu left the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later they disagreed on the matter of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I saw that I am a witness of the Lord, and I prayed for the gift of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord gave me the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the Lord's mercy, I received the gift outwardly, but I was still very dry inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Later I read the book In His Presence and other books by Madame Guyon and turned from the pursuit of gifts to the pursuit of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the war broke out, I was not able to fellowship with spiritual brothers, and I was short of spiritual books.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, I did not receive any supply from others but had to struggle in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During this period of spiritual pursuit, I often found myself grieved in spirit and losing my peace.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I did not enter into rest until I heard Brother Nee release the messages of life on May 25, 1948 at Customs Lane in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I realized that the discipline of the Spirit comes before our conduct, while the condemnation of the conscience comes after it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I also learned something concerning spiritual feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am willing to start all over again in learning to subject my mind, emotion, and will to spiritual discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I want to speak two things in particular to Brother Wu.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, in spiritual matters, we should not seek to understand too much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is better to be a little foolish and ignorant in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to learn to commit everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In spiritual matters, we should not say too quickly, "I have understood."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nor should we analyze too much with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We only have to be clear about the principles; we do not have to insist on knowing the fine details.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With many spiritual matters, we touch death as soon as we begin to analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we know about our inward condition, the more we die.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once I asked a doctor in Shanghai, "What do you touch when you operate on a human body, a living body or a dead corpse?"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He answered, "I only operate on living persons."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I responded, "But the parts that you operate on have been visited by death."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Wherever a surgeon's scalpel goes, death is present.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The same principle applies in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot analyze, understand, and clarify too much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we try to analyze, understand, and clarify our inward condition too much, we will touch death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can only understand our inward condition to a certain degree.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot go beyond a certain line.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Once we cross that line, we cross into death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My speaking here on the mountain is spoken with reservation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many spiritual things cannot be discussed or analyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if one can analyze some things, he can only do so in a limited way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But I myself do not know the extent of it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once a man crosses a certain boundary, he touches death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a child cuts open a man's heart because he wants to know what the heart is like, he will kill the man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I wrote The Spiritual Man under duress in sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was bad enough that I wrote it, but it hurts me more to see brothers and sisters discussing, studying, and analyzing it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>My delving into the subjects of that book was a taunting of the boundary line like a frontier line between two nations at war .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If anyone tries to study or analyze these subjects, he has crossed the boundary line, and the result will be nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our emphasis now is on the breaking of the outer man for the release of the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This has to do with facts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, we do not have to analyze too much, and we do not need to be too clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should not be too meticulous about the details.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we are, we will be led into death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If an organ is dead, the doctor can handle it and examine it, but anything living cannot be easily touched.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the Lord grants us mercy and gives us the light, everything will be clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today we can only stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we analyze and study too much, we will end up in death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All we need to do is trust in the Lord positively and obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There is no need to study or analyze too much.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What we really need is to experience the positive wound of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only those who have such wounds will afford the Lord a free way.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Whatever we do, we have to have the wound of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the only way for life to flow out in our service.</S>
