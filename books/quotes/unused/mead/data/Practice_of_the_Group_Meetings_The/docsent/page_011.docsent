   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING RELEASED, LIVING, AND FRESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the sake of the group meetings, we must always be released, living, and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must not be under any bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Almost everyone on earth is in some kind of shackle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every day we may be shackled.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may not be free persons, persons who are released, living, and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As a result, we are in debt to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We owe Him praises, songs, speakings, and testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we are released persons who are living and fresh, the Spirit within us has the full freedom to move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, many times when we come together, it seems as if we do not have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, we wait on the Spirit to come and release us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible tells us that we have a human spirit Job 32:8; Zech 12:1 and the divine Spirit Rom 8:9, 11, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To wait for something that we already have is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have the divine Spirit in our human spirit, so we should exercise our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not matter whether or not we feel our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not need to feel our spirit; we only need to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We Christians are the people of a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Testament, God speaks in the principle of incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He does not speak only by Himself; He speaks through our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we speak, He speaks in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not speak, we stop His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we must exercise our spirit whenever we come together.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we turn on a light switch, the electricity operates.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same way, when we exercise our spirit by crying, O Lord Jesus! we have the sensation that the Holy Spirit is moving within us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is because as Christians we have a regenerated, enlivened, and strengthened human spirit that has been mingled with the divine Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit never leaves our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He remains in our spirit and is mingled with it at all times.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we are able to exercise our spirit at any time and in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The problem is that many times we do not exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we do not move, the Spirit has no way to move.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He becomes shackled by us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we exercise our spirit to testify in the meetings, we shake off the shackles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A number of years ago, when I would give messages, I often would not use an outline for my speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When it was time to speak, I would simply walk up to the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I did not have any verses prepared, but when it was time for the Scripture reading, the verses I needed for my message would come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Likewise, when I would begin to speak, the message itself would come to me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we exercise our spirit, the Spirit within us rises up, because the Spirit is one with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one can separate the two.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Spirit has been put into our spirit to be the very essence of our spiritual being.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, we do not need to wait for the Spirit, because the Spirit is our very essence.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We simply need to use our mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We need to be trained and even disciplined to meet in a released, living, and fresh way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many times our meetings are dead, cold, old, poor, and low because we are still shackled.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For this reason it is difficult to have group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The group meetings need at least one person who is released, living, fresh, and unshackled.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If such a person meets with a group for two or three weeks, the entire group will be affected by him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the attendants in that group meeting will become the same as he is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In that group meeting the new believers all will be released, living, and refreshed because from the day they first became Christians they participated in released, living, and refreshing meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They will not know any other way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without shouting, praising, and saying, O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Amen! they would not consider that they have been to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, many of us are not this way.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For many years we have been molded to be what we are today, always coming to the meetings in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If this is our habit, it will be very difficult to have proper group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have group meetings in the old way is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to the old way, the elders divide the church into several groups and appoint a leader for each group.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If they have difficulty finding a leader among all the attendants in a certain group, they may either combine groups or appoint a brother from a different area to join that group.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, even these leaders may be examples of deadness to the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They may call a hymn in a dead way and lead the reading of some lessons in a dead way.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Group meetings conducted in this way are meetings with no spirit, no release, no livingness, and no freshness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must be released, living, and refreshed persons.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then we should forget about all formality and ritual and exercise our spirit to testify, sing, praise, shout, speak, pray for others, and care for others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The group meetings depend on our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must live a life that is released, living, and refreshing, and we need to keep a constant fellowship with the Lord all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must be persons living in the Lord s presence and spending time daily with the Lord to study His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this way we will spontaneously have an accumulation of Christ in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This accumulation will become our spiritual riches, our spiritual capital, to spend in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We will be released, living, and refreshing, and we will have the riches of Christ as a deposit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then, when we come to the group meetings, we will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We will speak, and we will have a content of Christ with which to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we are such persons, we will be very contagious and will infect others.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What we do in the meetings will not be a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It will be the issue of what we are and the spontaneous way we live and behave.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We will be able to shout, praise, sing, and speak in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the way to have the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we are such living persons, it will be easy for us to release sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We may not be released but may be shackled when we go to knock on people s doors.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If this is the case, the people may open their doors to us, but what we say will not be releasing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>What comes out of our minds will not release people; rather, it will bind them.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, if we are released persons, we can speak the same words, but the spirit in our speaking will be different.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we speak, our word will release people and it will stir up the interest of those to whom we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Today many Christians are seeking spiritual power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, the real power is in our being released persons.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>A released, living, and refreshing Christian lives in the spirit, and when he uses his spirit, the Holy Spirit comes out.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is easy for such persons to help people be saved and, after they are saved, to spend time with them to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must all learn to live such a life and be such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we all become such persons, after a short time the entire church will be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This kind of revival will be a real, constant, and continuous revival.</S>
