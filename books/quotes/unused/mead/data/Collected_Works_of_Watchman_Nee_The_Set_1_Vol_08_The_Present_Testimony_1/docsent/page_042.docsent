   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>HEART AND MIND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 4:6-7 says, "In nothing be anxious, but in everything, by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses every man's understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two verses say that God can save a person's heart and thoughts, delivering him from anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To what extent is the Lord's authority able to save a person?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is able to save a person to the extent that the peace of God guards his heart and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word guard has a special meaning in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The most accurate translation for this word is a special term used in military science.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It can be translated as "garrison."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The verse means that the peace of God guards our hearts and thoughts in a way similar to a curfew set up in a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>During a curfew, the army is empowered to garrison the curfew area, making the area safe and free from danger.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's peace can guard our hearts and thoughts in the same way as an army guards a locality to keep it peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God can deliver us from all anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The peace of God garrisons our hearts and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have not yet seen many Christians who are without anxieties about something.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The majority of them are full of worries.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was a mother who had seven sons.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She said, "I worried about each son until he grew up and got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are two who are now in heaven, so I don't have to worry about them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But I still worry about the remaining five sons."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A brother told her that worrying in this way was a mistake; it was a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But she said, "A mother ought to worry for her own children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If she does not worry, that is sin."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The brother pointed out Philippians 4:6-7, but she thought that the anxiety mentioned there did not apply to her kind of worry.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to her, the wife must worry about the husband, the parents must worry about the children, and the businessman must worry about his business.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the Bible says, "In nothing be anxious."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It does mean that we can worry about a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It means to not worry about anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have not seen many brothers or sisters who are anxious in nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is not full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you worry about your whole family and are anxious about so many things about this and about the peace of God is not guarding your heart and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a person cannot testify, saying, "My Lord is the One who bears my burden day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Anxiety is a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God can save you from all anxiety.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No matter how big or small, heavy or light a thing is, you ought to be anxious for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you still have not experienced the peace of God keeping your heart and thoughts, the salvation you have obtained is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you have seen this matter clearly, you will say, "O Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I have gained too little of what You have given me."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Praise and thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He can save us from all worry, to the extent where we are anxious for nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His peace is sufficient to guard our hearts and thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is possible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>WILL AND MIND</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Peter 4:1-2 says, "Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin , no longer to live the rest of the time in the flesh in the lusts of men, but in the will of God."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These two verses say that God can save our mind to the extent that we are willing to suffer as Christ did.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Are we afraid of suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all want to have an easy daily life that is free from suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whenever we have a little difficulty, we ask God to remove it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we really submit to God and our future becomes difficult and hard, we ask God not to allow the difficulty to come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But God can save us to such an extent that we are not afraid of difficulty or hardship, that we arm ourselves with a mind for suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is our armor?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Herein is the best armor: a mind to suffer just like Christ's. Whenever you submit to God, man may tell of difficulties and may set ways to deal with you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But by thinking of the suffering of Christ in the flesh and resolving to do the same, you are armed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now you are able to say, "The Lord came to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Suffering was not only His portion but also His duty.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Suffering was His business.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He wished to suffer."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You can overcome all things if you arm yourself with such a mind.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not only will you not be afraid of suffering, you will welcome suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Not only will you not turn away from suffering, you will let suffering come looking for you.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you fear and shrink back whenever you think of suffering, your salvation is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God can save you to the extent that you can have a mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you have a mind to suffer, you are living the rest of your time in the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Praise and thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is possible!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He can save you to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>James 1:26-27 says, "If anyone thinks himself to be religious and yet does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this one's religion is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is pure and undefiled religion before our God and Father: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction and to keep oneself unspotted from the world."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>James 3:8-10 also says, "But the tongue no one among men is able to tame; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made according to the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Out of the same mouth come forth blessing and cursing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These things, my brothers, ought not to be so."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>These two passages talk about the tongue which no man can tame.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But God can save an untamed tongue to the extent that it becomes a tongue that can be bridled by us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I met a person who said, "James said clearly that no man can tame the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, it is excusable for Christians to be unable to tame their own tongues."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But we need to know that James 3:10 plainly says, "These things, my brothers, ought not to be so."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Moses could not enter Canaan for one reason: he said a quick word.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The words Moses spoke were unbecoming of a learner.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Not only do we need a learner's ear, but we need a learner's tongue as well.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Only then will we know how to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God can save not only our heart, mind, and thoughts to a full extent, but He can also save our tongue to a perfect extent.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we cannot bridle our own tongue, I say again, we are not fully saved.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Praise and thank God!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He can save our tongue to a perfect extent.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This can be done.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It is possible.</S>
