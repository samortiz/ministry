   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RELATED TO LUST, AMBITION, AND IDOLATRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the record in 1 Kings, two kings Solomon, a good king, and Jeroboam, an evil king took the lead to set up the high places.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the case of Solomon, the building of the high places was related to the indulgence of lust.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Solomon had hundreds of wives and concubines.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to satisfy their desire, he built up high places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His wives had "turned away his heart after other gods" 1 Kings 11:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the case of Jeroboam, the building of the high places was related to ambition 1 Kings 12:26-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jeroboam wanted to maintain his empire.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fearing that the kingdom would return to the house of David if the people went to Jerusalem to worship, Jeroboam "made houses on high places" v. 31, Heb . Hence, Jeroboam's ambition was the cause of his decision to build up high places.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, Jeroboam made two calves of gold and said to the people, "It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt" v. 28 . He then "set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan" v. 29 . Furthermore, "Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah" v. 32 . The month of this feast was "devised of his own heart" v. 33 . Jeroboam even made "priests from among all sorts of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi" v. 31, Heb . What evil is associated with high places! The high places were related to lust, ambition, and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since high places signify divisions, this indicates that the divisions among Christians today are related to these evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Not many Christians realize that division is connected to lust, ambition, and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Most Christians would not go beyond saying that divisions are wrong and unscriptural and that they cannot agree with them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, in the eyes of the Lord, division involves such things as lust, ambition, and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Remember, a high place is an elevation, something lifted above the common level.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that a high place involves the exaltation of something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In principle, every high place, every division, in Christianity today involves the uplifting, the exaltation, of something other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The things that are exalted may not be evil.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the contrary, they may be very good and may include even Bible study or Bible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Surely it is a good thing to teach the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But Bible study may be related to division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In such a case, even a meeting for the study of the Scriptures becomes a high place; it may lead to the exaltation of something in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today it is common for Christians to elevate things in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, some elevate the practice of baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although it is right and scriptural to immerse people, it is not right to exalt immersion in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To do this is to build a high place for the exaltation of a particular mode of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The existence of such a high place always gives an opportunity for the indulgence of lust or for the fulfillment of ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, the unique place of God's choice kills our lust and restricts our ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even a very good thing such as Bible study can open the way for lust and ambition to come in, if it is exalted above Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lust is inevitably followed by idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ambition, in fact, is a form of idolatry.</S>
