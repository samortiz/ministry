   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING SERVICE 2 Date: Thursday evening, February 16, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Place: Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The hymn that we sang tonight tells us that the manifestation of God's glory enables us to consecrate ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all know that sin is evil and the world is attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is impossible for us to drop the world by ourselves, but the Lord's glory enables us to drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THINGS TO PAY ATTENTION TO</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>IN THE VISITATION WORK</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Concerning visitation we have a few more things to say.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not Gossiping</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In visiting others it is best to restrict the conversation to spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not be loose in our talk.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who are talkative should pay special attention to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is bad enough to speak loosely at home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The consequence of loose speaking is much greater when visiting others on behalf of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In visiting others, we have to maintain the church's purity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to deal with nit-picking, criticism, and slandering as soon as they surface.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The purpose of making visitations is to build up others, not to tear them down.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, we must not be loose in our conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not get into right and wrong, and we should not argue.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Not Assuming the Place of a Teacher</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In making gospel visitations, it is inevitable that there will be some who have a problem with believing, even though they have put down their name and shown an interest in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In visiting them, we have to adopt the attitude of a learner.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not visit them by assuming the air of a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we go as a teacher, the result will not be good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It does not take many doctrines to get a person saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One grain of wheat can bear many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, one seed of the Word is enough to save a person; one does not need many doctrines for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as there is life, there will be sprouting and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some brothers continue to bring many people to the Lord through just one sentence of God or even half a sentence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The preaching of the gospel depends not on the preponderance of doctrines but on the impartation of life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Giving Our Own Testimony</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My suggestion is that the first time we visit someone, we should tell them our spiritual age and condition.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can testify, saying, "I was more or less the same as you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although I have believed in the Lord for many years, I was unclear about many things when I first believed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only now am I learning to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I may not be clear about many things, but there are one or two things that I am very clear about: My sins are forgiven, and I have joy and peace through my faith in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we testify to them in this way, they will be stirred up to seek the joy that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they are in darkness, they rejoice in their sin, but once they come under the light, they will grieve over their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Touching the Heart Rather Than the Head</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Next, we can say, "The church realizes that you have put down your name and expressed a desire to receive the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is sending me to come and visit."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This will touch their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to seize the opportunity to contact them and touch their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should not try to touch their head.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After the heart is turned to the Lord, the head will pose no problem at all.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our visitation will give the new ones an impression that the church cares for them, that it takes an interest in the affairs of their soul.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If they ask any question, we can defer it in a gracious way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not pay too much attention to their mind, but we should pay much attention to the reaction in their heart and spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Deferring to the Right Ones</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When We Cannot Help Them</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After we have made a few visits, we should evaluate whether or not we are able to help them to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we cannot, we should ask the responsible brothers to send one or two others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If they cannot help the new ones to get through, then perhaps the responsible brothers should visit them.</S>
