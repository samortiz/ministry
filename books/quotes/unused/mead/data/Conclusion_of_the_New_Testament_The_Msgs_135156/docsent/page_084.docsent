   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When Christ is our enjoyment, we have no appetite for bitterness, wrath, anger, or clamor.</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a difference it makes in our daily living when we are happy and satisfied through the enjoyment of God in Christ as grace!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 4:29 Paul says, "Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see that the word out of our mouth should give grace to those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Grace is God embodied in Christ as our enjoyment and supply.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our words should convey this as grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word that builds up others always ministers grace to the hearers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our words should communicate God in Christ as enjoyment, imparting Christ to others as their life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians 4:25 says, "Having put off the falsehood, speak truth each one with his neighbor, for we are members one of another."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our words should be with grace, and our speaking should be of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Falsehood in verse 25 refers to anything that is false in nature.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we are filled with Christ, our speaking will be of things that are true.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because we may be preoccupied with natural concepts of truth, we may find it difficult to understand the meaning of truth according to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may regard truth merely as doctrine or sincerity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to the New Testament, truth is God revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In principle, because grace and truth have come through Jesus Christ John 1:17 , they must be something of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus is God coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When God comes to us, He does not come as doctrine or sincerity.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words, when God is enjoyed by us, He is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when God is revealed to us, He is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Truth, therefore, is God revealed to us.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have seen that truth is God revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may also say that truth is the shining of light, the expression of light.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since God is light 1 John 1:5 , truth is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Every aspect of the life of Jesus recorded in the Gospels is an expression of God.</S>

   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In Ephesians 4:17-24 we have the principle of our renewed daily living for the learning of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This principle is the truth, the living of the Lord Jesus when He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord's living was that of always putting off His own life and of putting on the Father's life.</S>
