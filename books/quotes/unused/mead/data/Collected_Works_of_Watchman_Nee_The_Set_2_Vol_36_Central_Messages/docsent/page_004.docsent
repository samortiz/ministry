   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE SPOKEN OF IN THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Philippians 1:21 says, "To me, to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Does it say that to live is to be like Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>No. Does it say that to live is to imitate Christ? No. Does it say that to live is to make Christ our pattern and example, and to follow Christ? No. It says, "To me, to live is Christ." It is absolutely useless to imitate or to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even if we can read the Bible, pray, live a good life, and pursue diligently, as long as we have a wrong life, we will still end up with a wrong living.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may yearn, weep, repent, and pray to God, "God, I really want to obey You," but there is something basically wrong with us we have a wrong life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has not merely put Christ on the cross to die for us; He has made Christ our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers and sisters, please be clear that God has no intention that we live the Christian life in such a difficult way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God wants us to be Christians, but He has no intention that we be like monkeys who are taught to put on clothes, to eat, and to move around.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For a monkey to imitate a man is a great suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It would prefer to be a monkey rather than learn how to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has no intention of dealing with us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have no taste for reading the Bible even for five minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet we have considerable interest in reading other books.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We get nothing from our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet if we do not pray, our conscience condemns us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot give up the world.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yet we have no peace when we love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is truly difficult to be a Christian, and it is impossible to live as God does.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What a suffering this is!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet it is good that we can still suffer, because this proves that we are still on the right path.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you do not feel any suffering at all, I feel sorry for you, because this means that you have left the proper path.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The world's temptations are often great, yet we have nothing to say about them because we are inwardly touched by them, and we can only sympathize with others for being the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we see a person giving himself to the Lord, turning his back on the world, and turning to God to obey Him, we think how wonderful it would be if we could do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>So we make an effort to try again, only to realize the suffering related to the attempt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers and sisters, it would indeed be a great suffering if God required that we be such a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can one succeed when the standard is so high?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is cruel to ask a five-year-old child to lift a three- hundred-pound burden.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It would be inhuman to ask a child to bear a ten-thousand-pound weight.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet asking a Christian to live a life that belongs only to God involves a greater suffering than asking a five-year-old child to bear a three- hundred or ten-thousand-pound weight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many times we make an effort to try.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We try to suffer through it, or not exercise a craving for it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we find ourselves committing one sin after another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have not finished repenting before the things for which we repented come back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While our tears are still wet, the things for which we shed tears come back.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Brothers and sisters, it would be wonderful if we believed that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God does not want us to try.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible says that the life God gives is not a life which falls and repents over and over again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a life in which "to me, to live is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a life in which the Lord Jesus lives within us and out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Mary gave the Lord a body, and through this body the Lord manifested the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same way, we should give ourselves to the Lord and receive Him into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we do this, He will make us live a life that is the same as His.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers and sisters, a Christian does not need to try or imitate in order to be holy, to deny the self, to love the Lord singleheartedly, and to obey Him absolutely, because God has prepared Christ for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has appointed Christ to do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the one hand, Christ has kept the law for us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the other hand, He inwardly empowers us to keep God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the one hand, He died for us, and on the other hand, He lives for us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He accomplished salvation for us at Golgotha and applies this accomplishment at Golgotha in us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At Golgotha, He justified us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now He lives within us to enable us to live righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Not only has He obeyed God, but He now lives in us to enable us also to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Not only has He done things on our behalf, but He is now doing things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Here we see the importance of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul said, "And if Christ has not been raised...you are still in your sins" 1 Cor 15:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did not say that the record of our sins was still present; Christ has died, and the record of our sins has been removed.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But if Christ had not resurrected, we would still be in our sins, and our salvation would only be a half salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In our preaching of the gospel, we often compare the act of sin to owing a debt; Christ is like a rich friend whose death repays our debt.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This, of course, is right, and it is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But unfortunately, this is only a half salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is true that the Lord Jesus has paid our debt, but we must ask if He has done more than just pay our debt.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Will we not incur any more debt?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since He has cleared our old debt, will we incur new debts?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we continue to incur more debt that our Friend has to take care of, even though what we once owed has been paid by our Friend, is our salvation only a half salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Is God's salvation all about continuing to owe, even though our Friend has paid our debt, and continuing to sin, even though Christ has died for us?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Oh, God's salvation is the Lord Jesus dying for us at Golgotha and living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He has paid all our debts, and He lives in us so that we do not have to be in debt anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God has not saved us from hell merely to go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He has saved us to the extent that Christ becomes our life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we only receive half of this salvation, we will surely suffer and not have the joy of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Jesus Christ is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>God does not say that a Christian should do this and do that.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul said, "For to me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul was able to bear all the beatings and persecutions, pass through all kinds of danger, and be imprisoned in Jerusalem and sent to Rome because Christ lived in him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He was not trying to be like Christ, nor was he imitating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He was what he was because Christ was living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Otherwise, he would not have been able to live the way he did.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Just as a monkey cannot become a man, a Christian cannot learn to be "like Christ."</S>
