   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>K. Taking Others Along to Learn</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After an elder has helped a brother or sister to receive a burden, immediately he should take them along to learn to do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, when you help someone to pick up the responsibility of a district meeting, your duty is not yet finished.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You must still help him to learn how to bear the responsibility of this district.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must show him in a practical way how to do the job.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After he understands what you are doing, you have to ask him to do the same, while you are by his side to correct him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have to take him along in the learning.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what the elders have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Brothers, let me repeat this: if every elder is willing to practice this, they will be busy every day; they will not find themselves having nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can also testify that there is no work more effective than this work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This kind of work seems to be slow, but gradually, you will see the result.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In half a year, a brother will be perfected by you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After another period, another brother will be perfected by you again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Five years ago, there might have been only three or five people working.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After five years, it becomes thirty or fifty people working.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The result will be abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unfortunately, not too many elders are taking others along to learn in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brothers, if you are wise, you should adopt this way quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The result of our managing of the church proves that we have to change from our former ways.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone knows that agricultural products always need improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The seed needs to be improved, the method of planting needs to be improved, and the harvesting needs to be improved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only by improving can there be better results.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is foolish for a man to be stubborn, proud, and conservative.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must learn to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not to say that what I am sharing has reached the highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No, I am only here to open the way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you are willing to walk in this pathway, you will discover that you will learn many lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the same time, the church you are managing will also take on a different form.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I want to mention one thing in passing: I hope that those among us, whether it is the elders or the workers, would be fully delivered from the Christianity way of doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The way of Christianity depends very much upon the preacher.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christianity likes to invite Dr. Chang to speak today and Pastor Wang to speak tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After a few days, another famous evangelist will be invited to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But what is the result of all these speakings?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can say that there is not much result.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, I absolutely do not agree that any district meeting or local church should invite one co-worker to speak today and another to speak tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Dear brothers, even if you have invited all of the co-workers to speak, and even if all of them have indeed come and spoken, you are still you; you have not changed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At most you have a few people saved, or more than that, you may have a few more people to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But what use does this have?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can never see the building up of the church or the coordination of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To have the building and the coordination, there is the need for the responsible ones to labor.</S>
