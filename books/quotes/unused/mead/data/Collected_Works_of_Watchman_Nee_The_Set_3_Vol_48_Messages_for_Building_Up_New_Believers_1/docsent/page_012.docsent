   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. A Great Gospel I Am Dead</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the Lord Jesus was crucified, He carried us along with Him to the cross; we were crucified there as well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the eyes of God, He has terminated us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What do you think of yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You may say, "I am a terrible person to deal with!"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who do not know themselves do not realize how impossible they are.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A person who knows God and who knows himself will say, "I am an impossible person."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we were heavy-laden with sin, we heard of the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then we saw that we were beyond all hope and that we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is also the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thank God, this is the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord's death has included all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are dead in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is a great gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Just as the Lord's death is a great gospel, our own death is also a great gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as the Lord's death is a joyful matter, our own death is also a joyful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What should be the first thought that comes to our mind when we hear that our Lord has died?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should be like Joseph of Arimathea; we should bury Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Similarly, when we hear that we are dead, the first thing that we should do is to bury ourselves, because burial is the first thing that follows death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Death is not the end. We are already dead in Christ; therefore, the first thing we need to do is bury ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Having Died and Risen</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers, when we step into the water of baptism or when we look back after being believers for many years, we must remember that we are already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We allowed others to bury us because we believed that we were already dead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If our heart is still beating and we are still breathing, we cannot be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In order to be buried, we must be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord was crucified, we were crucified too.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We allowed others to put us into the water because we believed that we had died.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus has resurrected; He has put His resurrection power within us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now we are regenerated through this power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This resurrection power operates within us and causes us to be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why we rose from the water.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are no longer our former self; we are now resurrected persons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today, we must always remind ourselves of this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we went into the water, we believed that we died and needed to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we came up from the water, we believed that we had newness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now we are on the side of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Death is on the other side, but resurrection is on this side.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. I Am in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once I saw a headline in the newspaper which read, "One Person, Three Lives."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The article was about a pregnant woman who had been murdered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the woman died, it became known that she was pregnant with twins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the headline read, "One Person, Three Lives."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Please note that concerning the Lord, it is, "One Person, Millions of Lives."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why the Bible repeatedly emphasizes the words in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the murder spoken of above, the murderer apparently killed only the mother; he did not kill the two children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, because the two children were in their mother's womb, they died when their mother died.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, since we are in Christ, when Christ died, we died in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God has put us into Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the revelation in 1 Corinthians 1:30: "Of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since Christ has died, we are all dead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The basis for our co-death with Christ is our being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not know what being in Christ means, we will not understand what dying with Him means either.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How could the children die with their mother?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They died because they were in their mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The analogy in the spiritual realm is even more real.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has joined us to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Christ died, we died also.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As soon as this gospel is preached to us, we should learn to look from God's viewpoint and acknowledge that we have died in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have died because we believed this to be a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have been buried in the water and have come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We declare that we are on this side of the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Reckoning in Romans 6 involves both reckoning oneself dead in Christ Jesus and reckoning oneself alive in Him as well.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brothers and sisters, I hope that you will take this way once you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>These are two separate thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One thought comes before baptism, and the other comes after baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Before baptism we must see that we have already died and that we need to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After baptism we must realize that we are in resurrection and that we can therefore serve God today.</S>
