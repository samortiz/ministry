   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE TWENTY-FIVE OVERCOMING THREE LAYERS OF OBSTACLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY THE VITAL GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message I would like to give some brief fellowship to help us see the need of the vital groups from a particular angle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Probably none of us has ever picked up this angle to look into the need of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why were we burdened to have such groups, and why did we pick up the word vital?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I would like us to consider the reason for this from one particular angle, and this angle is the situation we have gradually come to in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THREE LAYERS OF OBSTACLES TO THE LORD S RECOVERY IN THE UNITED STATES</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord s recovery came to this country in 1961 and we started our ministry in 1962.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was sixteen years after the end of the Second World War.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Due to the war, the American psychology was changed quite much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time among the Christians, there was a remnant of seeking ones raised up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By that time the United States had become the biggest country with Christianity as its main religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This country had millions of Christians, both Catholics and Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Mainly among the Protestants, the Lord gained a remnant, the real seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sixteen years after the war, the recovery came, and the recovery was greatly welcomed by this remnant of seeking ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I traveled across the United States in the early years of my ministry, and many were caught by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That was the first stage of the recovery in the United States, and it lasted for about nine years, from 1962 to 1971.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In those years, much of the increase came from my visits to many places and people throughout the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Wherever I went, seeking people were caught for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By 1970 we had over six hundred saints meeting in the church in Los Angeles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In that year we decided to migrate.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This migration of the saints to other localities in the United States was victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1973 we had our summer conference in Los Angeles in the convention center.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There were over three thousand there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We had to open up four overflow rooms, and that still could not meet the need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the first stage of the Lord s recovery to bring in the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In that increase, however, some came in with a heart that was not so pure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They saw the booming work among us, and they came in to try their best to get this work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When they realized they could not get it, they rebelled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That period of time lasted from 1973 to 1978.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>During the time that we were booming, our young people were really on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eighty college students set aside half a year just for the purpose of building our meeting hall in Anaheim.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Meanwhile, another group of people in Berkeley saw our situation and did not agree with us, so they formed a group to write something against us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They produced a manuscript full of false and defamatory things about us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Later, they were split into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One used this manuscript to write the book called The Mindbenders, and the other group used the same manuscript to write another book called The God-men .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These evil writings against us came out in 1977.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That began the opposition in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Also in 1977 another group hired someone to come to Anaheim to oppose us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In order to deal with this opposition and proclaim the truth, we put an article in the newspaper every Saturday for three and a half months.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We also repeatedly tried to contact the writers and publishers of the two evil, defamatory books against us, but they rejected us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In 1980 we had a conference in Albuquerque.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the leading brothers met there, one of the co-workers said that if we did not deal with these two books, our work, especially on the campuses, could not be carried on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was because whenever we contacted a new one, regardless of whether he was a Christian or not, he would receive a copy of these evil books soon afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was in Albuquerque that we made the decision to appeal to our Caesar, just as Paul did to preserve his ministry Acts 25:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our Caesar is the law of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because of our appeal, both of these evil books were exposed, withdrawn, and put down.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, our good name was damaged and our reputation was smeared throughout the whole country.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We took five years in litigation to put down those two books and gained the victory in both cases.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we had not taken this action, those two books would have continued to damage us to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In addition to this, we need to realize that the United States is a very worldly country due to its riches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Americans are living in worldliness without any consciousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The whole world follows the worldliness of the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because we are not worldly, others may think we are out of date.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many Americans think that they are the most modern people on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But we do not want to be in this worldly way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order to dress well, have the best house, and have the best car many try to get a high education so that they can get a high position to make the most money.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is all worldliness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of course, the Lord brought His recovery to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My coming here was not up to me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Then when I met all the seeking ones in this country, that surprised me.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord collected eight hundred to one thousand real seeking ones for His recovery within just a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In those early years, nearly everyone among us was a real seeking one who would pay any price to follow the Lord absolutely for His interest.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But we have to realize that worldliness is a big obstacle in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Furthermore, the truth which we practice concerning the ground of the church one church for one city, one city with only one church annuls all the standings of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thus, what denomination would have anything good to say about us?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Under the teaching of the ground of the church, all the divisions, the denominations, are condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Worldliness, the opposition, and the denominations are three layers of obstacles to the Lord s recovery in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The United States is the strongest country for Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>All the denominations are very strongly founded.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet we were raised up to stand on the ground of the church, the genuine ground of oneness, which is a testimony against all the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We may think that it will be easy to gain people for the Lord s recovery, but it is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are not in an easy situation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>These three layers of obstacles, or three blockades, are here to frustrate us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We need to overcome the worldliness in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Worldliness, the opposition, and the denominations are three blockades to gaining the proper increase in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If this were not the Lord s recovery, with the foundation on the truth and with the condition in life, we would have been brought to nothing already.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Despite the blockades, the Lord s recovery is still solidly standing here.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the last five years, beginning in 1987, there has been turmoil caused by certain factious ones who have caused divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In spite of this turmoil, the churches in Southern California had an increase of close to thirty percent per year over the last five years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>At the beginning of 1987, we had only a little over one thousand saints in Southern California.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But by October of 1992, we had increased to about three thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The only drawback is that we have had very little increase among the Caucasians during this period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>With all of this fellowship as a background, we can see how difficult it is for us to gain the typical, middle-aged Caucasians.</S>
