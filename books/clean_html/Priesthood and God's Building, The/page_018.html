<h2 class="head1">BEING OPEN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Opening Being a Matter of Our Spirit</h2>
<p>If we consider the picture of the water of life, we will realize that being open is a matter of our spirit. This is because the living water is God, who is Spirit. When God contacts us and flows through us, our spirit is always involved. Hence, when we speak of being open and letting Him flow into and out of our spirit, our emphasis is entirely on our spirit.</p>
<p>Often when we speak to others, our spirit is not open. Our soul may be open to chat, to sympathize, and to agree with the thoughts and opinions of others, but our spirit is closed. Some brothers and sisters can chat with one another for hours without feeling tired, but they cannot pray together. This shows that our souls can be open to one another but that our spirits are closed because of many barriers. Being open does not depend merely upon an outward opening; it depends upon the release of the spirit so that there can be genuine fellowship in the spirit. Being open also does not mean having a &ldquo;frank talk&rdquo; that unleashes a stream of discontentment toward others. Such &ldquo;frank talk&rdquo; merely releases the flesh, not the spirit. Some brothers and sisters are very open and talkative by disposition. When they talk, they tend to have no reservations and no sense of measure. Such people seem to be very open on the surface, but their talk is nothing more than an expression of their soul. If they are not exercised in the spirit, their words will not come from the spirit, and their words will not have the flavor or sense of the spirit.</p>
<p>We must see that being open is a matter entirely in the spirit. When we exercise our spirit, there is an opening for the living water of life to flow. This flow of life is actually God, who is also the Spirit. Such a flow does not begin in our soul, but rather in our spirit. This flow must be released through our spirit and then flow out of us through our soul. If we do not release the flow through our spirit, it will not be able to flow out of us through our soul. Hence, we must learn to be open in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying</h2>
<p>In order to be open in our spirit, we must spend time in prayer. If we desire to be open, we must exercise our spirit more. The exercise and use of our spirit mainly involve prayer. If we are short of prayer, we will have a deflated spirit. It is difficult to have an open spirit when we do not have a spirit that is strong, living, full, and uplifted. If we desire to have a strong, living, full, and uplifted spirit, we must spend time in prayer.</p>
<p>Our spirit is an organ to contact God, and the most crucial way to contact God is to pray. An audible prayer is prayer, and a silent prayer is also prayer. Even looking to God for a brief moment is also prayer. As long as we pray in these ways, our spirit will touch God. If we pray more, our spirit will touch God more, and our spirit will be strong, living, fresh, full, and released. With such a spirit, opening our spirit will be something that is quite spontaneous.</p>
<p>Our mingled spirit is a praying spirit (Rom. 8:16, 26), and the Spirit of God is even called &ldquo;the Spirit of grace and of supplications&rdquo; (Zech. 12:10). Such a Spirit causes us to pray. If we want our spirit to be strong, we must pray; if we want the Spirit of God to increase in us, we must pray. By prayer our spirit is exercised, and by prayer our spirit is opened.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Opening Our Spirit to Others</h2>
<p>We also must learn to open our spirit to others. Some saints can open their spirit to God when they pray privately, but as soon as they pray with others, they cannot release their spirit. It is as if they can be open only before God but not before other people. As a result, God, as the flow of life, is restricted in both His flowing in and His flowing out. With a limited flowing out, the flowing in will dwindle. If we can release our spirit only when we are praying by ourselves, our opening is limited and inadequate. We must learn to exercise our spirit with others as well as before God. We should be open when we pray with others as well as when we pray by ourselves. This will let God, as the living water of life, flow in freely and flow out freely. When we are open before both God and the saints, the living water of life will flow freely without any obstruction in the church, and this flow will bring in abundant fruit.</p>
<p>In the past we received only a little leading in regard to opening ourselves to others. We paid attention to removing the barriers between us and God and to dealing with any problem between us and God, but we rarely considered the matter of removing the barriers between us and others and to dealing with any problem we might have with others, in order to be open to them. Because we lacked the leading in this aspect, it has not been easy to open ourselves to others. Even when we come together for a meeting, it is hard to be open to one another. We might be open when we pray alone but as soon as we are in a meeting, our spirit is closed toward others. As a result, the meeting is heavy and dead because the water of life cannot flow freely. The living water in the New Jerusalem flows throughout the city, but in our meeting this living water is blocked by walls and barriers in our being. With some saints, the water cannot flow in, and with others it cannot flow out. Other brothers and sisters are closed to the saints as well as to God, and still other saints are open to God but closed to others. Hence, we rarely have a meeting that truly expresses the New Jerusalem, in which the water of the life flows unhindered.</p>
<p>For example, in a bread-breaking meeting, the flow of the Holy Spirit may come to me and urge me to pray. However, if I am unwilling to open my mouth due to many considerations and fears, the flow of the Spirit will be obstructed. This restricts the Spirit in the meeting. Later, if the flow of the Holy Spirit comes to you, urging you to call a hymn, but you do not allow Him to flow out, the bread-breaking meeting will be dry and dead, the saints will not be supplied, and their thirst will not be quenched. We must learn to be open in every meeting. When the Holy Spirit moves in us, we should give Him the freedom to freely flow out by releasing our spirit. The extent to which we utter something of the Spirit is the extent to which the Spirit can flow out from within us. This is a crucial point related to our exercise.</p>
