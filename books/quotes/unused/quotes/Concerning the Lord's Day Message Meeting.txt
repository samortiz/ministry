Today we want to spend some time to see the situation concerning the ministers of the word in the local churches
According to our past custom, the churches in every locality have always maintained the Lord's Day message meeting
The Lord's Day morning preaching meeting, however, is something of Catholicism and Protestantism; it is not a meeting of the church
The nations practice this, so if the brothers in our midst do not, it would be very difficult to maintain the meetings in their localities
Before the meetings in Hankow, we saw that it is wrong for a brother who is a worker to always remain in the same place
Today it seems that a worker still needs to live in a particular place in order to maintain the Lord's Day message meeting
If the church wants to be successful as the church and successful as the Body of Christ in a locality, then the entire Body must serve
The service of the entire Body is that all the people, whether five-talented, two-talented, or one-talented, rise up to serve God
You have to gather the new believers and let them know that every Lord's Day is the day on which all of us are busy
If the church does not endeavor until everyone in the church is working and everyone in the church is serving, then there is no church
Everywhere there will be three or five or seven or eight people serving God; you will be able to find the church everywhere
We could eliminate this manner of listening to messages and, instead, have the entire church serve according to God's word in the Bible
The Lord's Day mornings would be for all the priests to serve man, and the Lord's Day evenings would be for all the priests to serve God
If within you are capable and strong enough, you will always push and always work, and you will be able to tear down our entire tradition
Regarding the ministry of the word, for now we will use the following arrangement: We will have fifty-two topics for the regular year
We need to spend an entire year to touch all the main matters in the Word of God and the way to be a Christian
If you are dead before God, these things will become like publicly recited prayers; they will become dead things
If all of you are dead before God, even the living things will become dead, even a book as living as the Gospel of John
Once some have been saved and brought in, you must pay attention before God to give the new believers a clear leading in the word
Some may ask how we should supply the older brothers, and many other brothers and sisters among us, with the word
Every Lord's Day morning we have to preach the gospel and every Thursday we must have the meeting for edifying new believers
The Saturday night meetings have to be very living, not like today's Lord's Day message meeting, which is maintained in a dead way
What will bind them together is everyone testifying, everyone preaching the gospel, and everyone saving people
If we get them accustomed to working, and they move to another locality, they will feel that they cannot do without the opportunity to work
Those who are burdened for the word and those who have a burden before God and are not passive will stand up on Saturday nights to speak
The Saturday night meetings are the same as the other meetings in that the responsible brothers should pray together
It should be the same with the gospel meetings the meetings for edifying new believers the prayer meetings and the breadbreaking meetings
The responsible brothers should always be there half an hour or fifteen minutes early to have some prayer and preparation
Those that enter in should be the ones who have a genuine burden before God, those who are fearful of having a poor meeting
The elders are for serving the church, and even though they are not for the ministry of the word, they should be apt to teach
Every time you come to the Saturday night meeting, there should be at least a few responsible brothers who are not passive
Perhaps a local church or several local churches in the area may join together two or three times to get some special help
In this way you will see that the church will be very balanced in the matter of the supply of the word, and her way will be straight
Today we are not talking about the locality which is the center of the work, but the localities outside the center of the work
Among them there is also the mutual edifying as in 1 Corinthians 14, that is, help rendered mutually by the saints from the word before God
If there is a need for further spiritual supply, we can immediately release many workers to go out and travel from place to place
If we expect to see a five-talented member rise up, we will realize that there are not very many in the church
Whether or not the gospel can get through is not a matter of preaching by the workers, it is a matter of preaching by the church
Many, including the sisters, need to go out, group by group, in twos or threes, so that every locality may be able to stand on its own
If this habit is overturned, it will be impossible to ask the brothers and sisters to just listen to a message on the Lord's Day
If not, we will definitely have to build a 'Solomon's Temple,' because there will not be a place that is large enough to meet in
After a group of believers has been raised up at the end of a year, you have to deal with them concerning their going on
If a place does not have the church, there will be a church there after one or two hundred people have been sent out
In Acts there are two different ways of preaching the gospel: one way is that of Antioch, sending apostles out to preach the gospel
At the same time, if we want to be strong in the matter of preaching the gospel, we need new apostles to rise up
If the Lord's Day message meeting continues to occupy the central position in a local church, there will be no way for the gospel to advance
We must allow two or three brothers to rise up in every local church to preach the gospel on the Lord's Day and continue this work there
Perhaps, we will preach the gospel every Lord's Day morning and have the ministry of the word in the afternoon
My personal feeling is that we do not need to immediately eliminate the message meeting in the locality where the center of the work is
When we read the book of Acts, we must see that at that time there were not as many ministers of the word as we have now
At that time God's children probably paid more attention to preaching the gospel than to listening to messages
Today it seems that the basic factor of being a Christian is listening to messages rather than preaching the gospel
We must carry it out to such an extent that all the brothers and sisters are preaching the gospel before taking care of other matters
If this way can be carried out, the number of those saved in the past will not be comparable to the number that will be saved
At the same time, there will be no need to maintain so many workers in every place, and we will also begin to see churches rising up
It is your own responsibility before God as to how you will turn your way around and how much time it will take
You must take good care of the saints in order to lead them into this way, not quickly dropping one thing and quickly picking up another
If all the brothers and sisters have not yet risen up, you must continue working until they all rise up to work and preach the gospel
Being the church requires that we preach the gospel as the church; being the church requires that we serve as the church
Concerning the mutual edifying in 1 Corinthians 14, if the local brothers are strong, the Saturday night meetings will be strong
Once the Holy Spirit has the freedom, you can expect the Holy Spirit to speak in the church and operate in the church
As a rule he is specially trained for church work, but he may be either a local man, or a worker transferred from some other place
You may term it a hall, a meeting place, a chapel, or a church; but whatever you care to call it, such a place there must be
What is considered essential to a church these days, was considered totally unnecessary in the early days of the Church's history
Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons'
The deacons are the men appointed to serve tables , that is, those who care exclusively for the business side of things
They do not occupy such an important position as the elders, who rule the church; they are chosen by the church to serve it
As a rule they have their families, and their business duties, and are just ordinary believers of good reputation
The members of the church are local men, and as elders are chosen from among the ordinary members, it follows that they are also local men
The business of the worker is to found churches and appoint elders, never to take direct responsibility in the churches
No apostle coming from another place is qualified for the office of local elder; the post can only be occupied by local men
The thought in the questioner's mind is, 'Who is the man responsible for ministering and administering spiritual things in this church'?
If, in a company of believers, the minister is active and the church members are all passive, then that company is a mission, not a church
The thought of a church is so frequently associated with a church building, that the building itself is often referred to as 'the church'
According to Scripture it is not even necessary for a church to have a place definitely set apart for fellowship
The Jews always had their special meeting places, and wherever they went they made a point of building a synagogue in which to worship God
The amazing thing is that, not only did they not put up special buildings, but they seem to have ignored the whole subject intentionally
The temple of the New Testament is not a material edifice; it consists of living persons, all believers in the Lord
Because the New Testament temple is spiritual the question of meeting places for believers or places of worship is one of minor importance
He gathered them around Him now in a house, again in a boat, and there were times when He drew apart with them in an upper room
Judging from these passages, the believers assembled in a great variety of places and had no official meeting place
They had no buildings specially set apart for church use; they had nothing which would correspond to the 'church' of today
There was no official stamp upon it; it bore the marks of real life, in its perfect naturalness and pure simplicity
It was quite all right for some of the saints to sit on the window-ledge, or for others to sit on the floor, as Mary did of old
God wants the intimacy of the upper room to mark the gatherings of His children, not the stiff formality of an imposing public edifice
We read of the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila , the church in the house of Nymphas , and the church in the house of Philemon
Of course, not every church is a church in a house, but a church in a house should be encouraged rather than considered as a drawback
Somehow, as soon as people enter those special buildings, they involuntarily settle down to passivity, and wait to be preached to
A family atmosphere should pervade all gatherings of the children of God, so that the brothers even feel free to ask questions
The imposing structures of our modern times convey an impression of the world rather than of the Christ whose name they bear
Meetings connected with the work are arranged along totally different lines, and are entirely under the auspices of the workers
As we have seen, when Paul reached Rome a church was already in existence there, and the believers already had their regular gatherings
Paul did not use the meeting place of the church for his work, but rented a separate place, as he stayed for a prolonged period in Rome
In Troas he only stayed for a week, so he did not rent a place there, but simply accepted the hospitality of the church
When he went away, the special meetings he had been conducting there ceased, but the brethren in Troas still continued their own meetings
Christ is the Head of the Church and 'we who are many are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another'
Apart from Christ, the Church has no head; all believers are only members, and they are 'members one of another'
All those who compose a church take their place as members of the Body, not one occupying the position of head
If we are to differentiate clearly between the two, we must first understand the different nature of church and work
One stood before the others, and by his preaching directed the thoughts and hearts of those who sat quietly listening
In the church meetings, 'each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation'
It is not a case of one leading and all the others following, but of each one contributing his share of spiritual helpfulness
True only a few of those present take part but all may only a few are actual contributors to the meeting but all are potential contributors
The meeting which was held immediately after the Church came into existence was an apostolic meeting for unbelievers
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
The prophets and teachers minister the Word as the Lord gives it, while others minister to the assembly in other ways
An opportunity is given to each member of the church to help others, and an opportunity is given to each one to be helped
That such assemblies are assemblies of the church is seen at a glance, because the stamp of mutuality is clearly upon all the proceedings
The last type of meeting is a church meeting, for the phrase 'in the church' is used repeatedly in the passage which describes it
Individual responsibility has been lost sight of, and passivity has hindered the development of spiritual life throughout the churches
An apostle settles down to pastor the church, and consequently the churches and the work both lose their distinctive features
For lack of activity the spiritual growth of the churches is arrested, and for lack of apostles the extension of the work is arrested too
Each individual must bear his share of responsibility and pass on to the others what he himself has received from the Lord
When the local church meets, it is the gifts that are brought into use; office has no place here, not even that of an apostle
Apostles, as apostles, represent an office in the work, and not any particular gift; therefore, here they are ignored altogether
In the organization of the church they have no place at all, because their ministry, as apostles, was not for the churches but for the work
The elders are those who hold office in a local church; the prophets and teachers are the gifted ministers in a local church
The elders are for church government at all times; the prophets and teachers are for ministry in church meetings
As to ministry, though they cannot minister as elders, yet, if they are also prophets or teachers, they can minister in that capacity
It is almost imperative that elders be prophets and teachers; otherwise, they cannot rule the church effectively
The point to be remembered is that church meetings are the sphere for the ministry of the Word not the sphere for the exercise of any office
The latter may be of a passing nature, and not necessarily a permanent institution, whereas the former are a regular feature of church life
It affords opportunity for an expression of mutuality, that essential feature of all relationships in the church
The churches, having to bear their own responsibility, will develop their own spiritual life and gifts through exercise
And they continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers
For such meetings a special place could be obtained either for the occasion, or permanently, according to existing church conditions
Local believers should learn to use the spiritual gifts with which God has entrusted them to minister to their fellow believers
The principle on which all church meetings are conducted is that of the 'round-table,' not of the 'pulpit-and-pew'
When any apostle visits a place, he could lead a series of meetings for the local church, but such meetings are exceptional
In the usual church gatherings the brethren should all make their special contributions in the power and under the leading of the Spirit
If the churches follow the lines God Himself has laid down for them His work will go forward unhindered and His kingdom be extended on earth
In the earlier chapters of this book we have already seen what the ministry, the work, and the local churches are
The prophets and teachers , whose sphere is local, plus the apostles, whose sphere is extra-local, constitute the ministry
As the former serve the churches, and the latter the work, the ministry is designed of God to meet the spiritual need in both spheres
The work is produced by the churches the churches are founded as a result of the work and the ministry serves both the churches and the work
Those who have both gifts and apostolic commission serve the Church by serving the churches in different localities
They were given to the Church 'for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ'
The ministry of these two groups of men is of great importance, because all the work of God-local and extra-local-is in their hands
That is why God's Word declares that the Church of God is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets
In the offices instituted by God we have the elders occupying the chief place in the local church while apostles hold no office at all there
In the local church, there are two departments of service, one relating to business management, the other to spiritual ministry
It should be repeated that elders, as such, are appointed for church government, and not for meetings to edify the church
Timothy 5:17 makes it clear that the usual sphere of their service is to rule, but some of them may also teach and minister
The ministry, the work, and the churches are quite different in function and sphere, but they are really coordinated and interrelated
Ephesians 4 speaks of the Body of Christ, but no discrimination is made there between the churches, the work, and the ministry
They are really one; so while it is necessary to distinguish between them in order to understand them better, we cannot really separate them
Those who are in the different spheres of the Church need to see the reality of the Body of Christ and act relatedly as a body
The churches are the Body expressed locally, the ministry is the Body in function, and the work is the Body seeking increase
Their relationship is so intimate and vital that none can be right itself without being rightly adjusted to the others
Consequently, they must move and act as one, for no matter what their specific functions and spheres, they are all in one Body
The importance of this principle cannot be over-emphasized, for without it everything is man-made, not God-created
