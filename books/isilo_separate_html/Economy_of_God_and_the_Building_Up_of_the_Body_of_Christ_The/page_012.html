They were able to defeat the enemy, gain the land, and build the temple of God there. The temple was an enlargement of the tabernacle. It was a dwelling place of God. This typifies that we the believers defeat the spiritual enemies, gain the territory in Christ, and build up the church as God&#8217;s temple. When we follow Christ, we receive the feeding of the manna, we receive the supply of the living water, and we overcome our flesh by Him. Furthermore, we deny the natural life by passing through the death of Christ, dying and resurrecting together with Him, and enter into Him, being joined together with all the saints to be built up into a solid dwelling place of God in Him.<h2 class=head3>Becoming Desolate, Failing, and Being Carried Away to Babylon and Returning from Captivity to Jerusalem to Rebuild the Temple of God on the Original Foundation</h2><p>After the temple was completed, the Israelites gradually became desolate, failed, and were eventually carried away to Babylon to be put under the rule of the Gentiles. After seventy years when the time was completed (2 Chron. 36:11-21), God called them out of Babylon to return to Jerusalem to rebuild the temple on the foundation of the original temple (Ezra 1:3). This typifies the history of the church after it came into being. From Revelation 2-3 we see that the church gradually became desolate, failed, and was carried away to the mysterious Great Babylon, which is the Roman Catholic Church. When the Reformation began during the sixteenth century, the church was delivered from Roman Catholicism back to the original position. Today we are like the returned Israelites, coming out of the mysterious Great Babylon and being recovered to the original ground of the church to rebuild the church of God.<h2 class=head3>Rebuilding the City of Jerusalem as the Circumference of God&#8217;s Temple, and Further Rebuilding the Temple and the City of Jerusalem during the Coming Restoration of the Nation of Israel</h2><p>The Israelites returned, built the temple, and recovered the holy city. When the Lord Jesus comes back again, the nation of Israel will be restored. By then they will rebuild the temple again and will build a bigger Jerusalem. According to Ezekiel 48, the Jerusalem that they will build will have twelve gates and will be their dwelling place with God in the millennium. This typifies the overcomers in the church and the overcoming saints of the Old Testament who will eventually become the New Jerusalem in the millennium. They will be the heavenly part of the millennium and will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. There they will exercise authority to rule with the Lord Jesus over the nations.<p>After the one thousand years, this heavenly Jerusalem will be enlarged to become the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth. She will include all the redeemed ones from all the ages to be the dwelling place and the expression of God in eternity future. She will also become the dwelling place of us, the redeemed ones. Hence, the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth will become the mutual dwelling place for God and man. God will dwell in the redeemed ones, and the redeemed ones will dwell in God their Redeemer. This New Jerusalem in eternity is the ultimate consummation of the church to be God&#8217;s eternal expression.<p>By now, we can clearly see that the history of the nation of Israel is a full type of the history of the church. The history of Israel begins with the Israelites corporately experiencing the Passover during the exodus from Egypt and goes on until the Lord comes back the second time when they will be restored to build the Jerusalem with the twelve gates. The history of the church also began with the Passover, which is the Christ who has been sacrificed (1 Cor. 5:7), and goes on until the millennium with its heavenly Jerusalem which also has twelve gates. Hence, whether it is the Old Testament or the New, in type or by revelation, the whole Bible speaks of the same thing, which is God&#8217;s economy. The economy of God is the Triune God working Himself into us, the tripartite men. He desires to be man&#8217;s life, content, and complete supply that man would become God&#8217;s representation and expression. In the beginning God gained individuals, from Adam through Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Then God gained a corporate Israel. When we were first saved, seemingly we were individuals; but gradually we feel that we need a corporate Body, which is the church. Because of this we begin to come together for the church life. Today, we are the genuine, real nation of Israel, expressing God as His dwelling place on earth.<p>I hope you would all see that this is what the Lord is after in His recovery on earth today. First He gains individuals; then He gains a Body. Today we all have our individual experiences; but we are also living a life in the church. It is a life in which the Triune God is joined to the redeemed ones as one spirit. He is our life and content, and we are His rest and habitation. He is our enjoyment, and we are His expression. All these begin with His Spirit mingling with our spirit, continue with the uplifting and the transformation of our soul, and consummate with the uplifting of our body, which is the redemption of our body. Eventually all the redeemed ones will become the New Jerusalem as the mutual dwelling place of God and us and as God&#8217;s eternal expression. May we all see this vision of God&#8217;s economy so that we would know how to live in the church and walk in a proper and bright way.<p>A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Seoul, Korea on November 6, 1988.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
