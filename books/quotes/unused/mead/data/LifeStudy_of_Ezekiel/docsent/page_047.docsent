   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CLEAR SKY AND THE THRONE VINDICATING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Whether the brothers and sisters listen to you or not, depends on where you are and on what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are you under a clear sky?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you are under a clear sky, there is no need for you to argue, and there is no need for you to claim anything or even say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The clear sky and the throne above the sky will vindicate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the local churches need this revelation of the throne above the clear sky.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the church life we do not have any organization or any kind of hierarchy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not have a mission board or any other board; we have no headquarters and no organization of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have only a clear sky with a throne above the sky.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I can testify that I am afraid only of one thing that I would lose the presence of my Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many times when I have been alone in my own room, I have declared to the whole universe and to myself that the only thing I fear is losing the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as I have the presence of the Lord, I am afraid of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I care only for His presence, not for anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, I care only for the clear sky with the throne above it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have the full assurance that as I am speaking these words, the throne is with me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Praise the Lord that this is sufficient!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all need to learn this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are so little, and we are unworthy, yet the Lord has visited us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I must confess that, in the past, sometimes I told the Lord that I did not like doing this job, and I asked Him why He has taken hold of me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At such times the Lord gave me a serious warning about speaking in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then I said, Lord, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do whatever You like.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am willing to lose everything, but I do not want to lose the clear sky and the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Under the Lord s covering, I testify that I really mean this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In your local church you should not care for anything except having a clear sky with the throne above it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As long as we have the clear sky and the throne, opposition and criticism mean nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The only thing we need to care for is the clear sky with the throne above it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE THRONE BEING</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN THE LIKENESS OF A SAPPHIRE STONE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ezekiel 1:26 speaks of the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we see that the throne has the appearance of a sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Exodus 24:10 is helpful in understanding the significance of the sapphire stone in Ezekiel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This verse says, They saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A sapphire stone signifies a kind of heavenly condition which exists when God is present in a particular situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to Exodus 24:10 when Moses, Aaron, and the chief men of Israel saw God, they saw under His feet the appearance of a sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This gave the people an insight into the appearance of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A sapphire stone is blue in color, and blue is a heavenly color indicating the situation and condition of God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse also says that at that time the heavens were exceedingly clear.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God was present in that kind of situation and atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the sapphire stone signifies the situation or the condition of the heavens with God s presence in it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The throne being in the likeness of a sapphire stone shows the presence of God in a heavenly situation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whenever we have the throne of God in a clear heaven, the situation will be heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There will not be anything earthly or anything gloomy or impure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Rather, everything will be heavenly, clear, clean, and absolutely transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This portrays the kind of situation we should have in the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever we have a clear sky with God s throne in it, we are in a heavenly situation having the appearance of a sapphire stone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I would ask you to look once again at the picture in Ezekiel 1.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is upon the throne above the firmament in the heavens, and the living creatures are walking or standing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through them the Lord in the heavens becomes one with the earth, and in this way the heavens are connected to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that the heavens have been brought down to the earth and that the heavens are now moving on earth through, by, and with the living creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This needs to be the situation among the local churches today, the situation among the overcomers, and the situation and condition of our daily Christian life.</S>
