<H1 CLASS=TITLE>A NOBLE DEED</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Mark 14:1-9</H1><P>Mark 14:9 says, "And truly I say to you, Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her." According to the Lord's word here, wherever the gospel is preached, this story should be told immediately afterwards. If the gospel is preached, but this story is not told, there is a great lack. Therefore, we have to speak of this story today. This is what the Lord told me as I was praying yesterday.</P><P>When did this story take place? Let us read verse 1: "Now the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread were two days away. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking a way to seize Him by craftiness and kill Him." The cross was in sight! The shadow of the cross was in sight!</P><P>What is the most significant point of this story? We can express it with the words of 1 Peter 3:15. It is to "sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts." The word sanctify is a verb. This story shows a practical way for the carrying out of this verse.</P><P>This story only invokes men to do one thing—to sanctify Christ as Lord. The Lord's word, "Wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done shall also be told as a memorial of her," is an instruction to us that, after the preaching of the gospel, there must be this kind of fruit. This story unfolds to us the meaning of this kind of fruit.</P><P>"A woman came [Mary—John 12:3], having an alabaster flask of ointment, of very costly pure nard." Pure nard is precious enough, whereas a very costly, pure nard is unmatched in excellence. This very costly, pure nard was inside an alabaster flask. The alabaster flask was also very precious. Not only was Mary offering to the Lord a costly ointment, but the flask that contained the ointment was also very precious. We can offer to the Lord only what is most precious.</P><P>"She broke the alabaster flask." Why did she do this? This kind of pure nard came from Persia, and there was no way for the ointment to come out except by breaking the flask. In this way, there could be no counterfeit.</P><P>"And poured it over His head." When she did this, the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment (John 12:3). Not only was the house filled with the fragrance then; even now as we read this passage, we can sense the fragrance! Even the house we are meeting in right now seems to be filled with fragrance! This love to the Lord and this consecration to Him indeed is a fragrance that has lasted until now and will last until eternity.</P><P>John 12:3 said that she "anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair." She placed her glory at the feet of the Lord! For a woman, her hair is her glory (1 Cor. 11:15).</P><P>At first she was only seen; now she could be smelled. She drew not only men's criticism, but men's indignation. However, she ignored all of them and did not care for them. It did not cross her mind that this was the house of a leper. She did not consider her present family condition nor her future hardships. She did not care for the criticism and the indignation of others. She simply did what she did.</P><P>She offered to the Lord in the way of "risking all"! We should be just as bold and willing as she was. "And the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment." This is absolute consecration. There are two meanings to consecration. One is to offer something to the Lord, and the other is to be separated solely unto the Lord in a dedicated way.</P><P>The ointment is for sanctification. The tabernacle with all its utensils was anointed. The word Christ means the "Messiah," which is the Anointed One. We should sanctify this anointed Christ as Lord. We should anoint Him and own Him as Lord, even as our Lord. We should offer up everything to Him and should heap everything upon Christ. We should not be afraid of following Him too foolishly or loving Him too fervently. When a young Christian bade farewell to an older man, the latter said, "I have only one wish, that you be a fervent lover of Christ!" There cannot be a limit to our loving the Lord, our serving Him, obeying Him, and our allegiance to Him; we can never overdo these things. The Lord loves to see us loving Him in a reckless way. He loves to see us loving Him beyond reason and against human affection. To Him, the gospel should result in men's being constrained by His death to love Him, consecrate to Him, and fully obey Him to the point that others would consider them extreme.</P><P>The degree that we offer ourselves to Him is dependent on the worth of the Lord to us. To those who believe, the Lord is precious (1 Pet. 2:7). Peter knew what this word meant. This is why in his Epistles, he mentioned the word precious many times. He added the word precious to the blood, the faith, the stone, the virtues, and so forth.</P><P>What did the disciples do when Mary acted this way? "But there were some who were indignantly commenting among themselves: Why has this waste of the ointment been made?" (Mark 14:4). They thought that this was a waste. But on whom was the ointment poured? Was the One being anointed not worthy of the ointment? This ointment was poured on the Lord. If this was a waste, it would mean that the Lord was not worthy of it. Was the Lord indeed not worthy of this ointment? Can anything be called a waste when it is applied to the Lord? Those who have never loved the Lord with a single heart think that too much consecration and obedience is a waste. In man's eyes, obeying the Lord, loving Him, and giving up everything for Him may sometimes be too much and may be a waste, but such criticism only shows the degree of love that the criticizing ones have.</P>
