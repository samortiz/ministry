   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN POSSESSION, OBSESSION, AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LIGHT OF GOD Scripture Reading: Isa 6:9-10; John 3:19-21; Matt 6:21-23; Psa 36:9; Prov 23:23; 2 Thes 2:10b-12; Acts 7:60b; 9:1-2; Phil 3:6a; 1 John 1:8 POSSESSION, OBSESSION, AND LIES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When a person is possessed, he falls directly into Satan's hand and is controlled and bound by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a person is obsessed, he is deceived by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First John 1:8 says that those who say that they have not sinned are deceiving themselves; they are obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Lying is different from being obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who lie are condemned in their conscience, but those who are obsessed are very confident in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are convinced that they are not lying when they really are.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They do not know that they are lying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A man who is obsessed takes his perception of reality as reality and considers his reality to be absolutely right.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Thessalonians 2:10-12 speaks of the perishing ones who do not receive a love of the truth but instead believe lies.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is very sad.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When a Christian overestimates himself, he follows the lies of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Unless these lies are removed, he will fall into obsession sooner or later.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>OBSESSION BEING TO DWELL IN DARKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past some people considered taking our way but eventually decided to take a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The reason they changed their mind is that they became convinced of their view concerning certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They thought it over and over, and in the end, they concluded that their views were absolutely correct.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that point no one could help them anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These ones have fallen into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not see the true nature of things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>One brother thought that it was right to have a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I exhorted him and tried to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Later, I learned that this brother was not trying to deceive me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he had been trying to deceive me, it would have been easier to help him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He was deceiving himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He would not give up his own view.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is very difficult to render help to this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The condition that leads to obsession is dwelling in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Jews rejected the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They thought that their rejection was very reasonable, but their reasonings were not based on the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a consequence, the Lord repeatedly said that they were living in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One can be obsessed not only in words but also in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Lying and obsession are essentially the same in content, but when one lies, the conscience condemns it as sin even as one tries to deceive others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With obsession, the mind tells one that he is not sinning, and the person believes that he has no sin.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Philippians 3 tells us that Paul was once obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was delivered from his obsession by the light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All obsessed persons bear one characteristic they are always very confident of themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though they have sinned, they do not admit it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Malachi 1 speaks of the Israelites sinning against God many times, yet they kept saying, "How have we despised Your name?...How have we defiled You?" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is falling into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Gospel of John has many examples of obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Jews' rejection of the Lord in 5:38 was not contrived; they were obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Other examples of obsession are in John 6:41-42, 52, 60; 7:28, 47; 8:24, 43-45.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>DELIVERANCE FROM OBSESSION</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The way to be delivered from obsession is found in Psalm 36:9: "In Your light we see light."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"Your light" refers to God's light, and "we see light" refers to our seeing the true nature of things through the shining of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many people like to judge according to their mind, ideas, imagination, and conjecture.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such views are often contrary to facts.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The most pitiful men are those who presume that they are right, who are very confident of themselves, and who are good at arguing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Actually, everything they talk about is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Everything they argue for is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should come before the Lord in fear and trembling and come under His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we do this, we will not become obsessed in the Lord's service and will not act like Paul before his conversion.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>THE PRINCIPLE, HINDRANCES,</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>AND CONDITIONS FOR BEING ENLIGHTENED</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One principle of enlightenment is that light shines through an opening.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord said that the light is in us in Matthew 6:23.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This inner light is the enlightening of the Holy Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Yet there can be hindrances to this inner enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>What hinders a person from receiving light?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>John 3:19-20 indicates that a man will not receive light once he is prejudiced and has preconceived ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, the first hindrance to light is prejudice and a refusal to come to the light.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The deeper a person is in the truth, the less assurance he should have of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A person who is prejudiced and who does not want to come under the light is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The second hindrance to receiving light from the Lord is one's desire to receive glory from men.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There are certain conditions one has to clearly fulfill before he can receive light.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The first condition is having a heart that seeks after God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If one seeks after God's will, he will know the true nature of things John 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, even such a heart cannot always guarantee that we will not be deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Therefore, we have to ask the Lord for mercy so that He would put in us a heart that genuinely seeks after His will.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Proverbs says that in order to receive the truth, we have to pay a price 23:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Lies do not involve any price; they are cheap.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we want the truth, we have to pay a price.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the second condition for receiving light.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will have a heart that seeks after God's will and will pay the price to gain the truth.</S>
