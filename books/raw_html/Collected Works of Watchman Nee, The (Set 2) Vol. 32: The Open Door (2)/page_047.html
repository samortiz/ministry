<h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Enclosed please find X dollars. This is an offering from a brother meeting in Ning-Hai. X dollars are for gospel work in remote border provinces, and X dollars are for saints in need. Please distribute it in prayer. Thank you for taking the time to do this. May the Lord remember you.</p><p>Brother Hwa Shi-bin, August 16</p><h2 class="head2">Ning-Po, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Dah-wei in the Lord:</p><p>We are still living in the villages. The brothers and sisters are all under the Lord's protection and are at peace. Please do not worry. Because of my business, I have stayed in the city as well as the villages. Although the environment is not safe, thank the Lord that business can still be carried on. There was even a period when business was quite busy. Everything is by the Lord's grace. Please be at peace. Shi-jie is still working in Hankow. If the situation becomes unstable, he will move to Chungking. Every Lord's Day morning, we have a children's meeting with thirty to forty children. They like to sing and are quite attentive. May the Lord cause seeds to be sown into good ground so that He will receive the glory. We feel that we are empty, weak, and in need of the support of His power and grace. Please pray for us and for the work. One brother who came to know the Lord three years ago was recently revived and has become very seeking. Unfortunately, he has been sick with some kind of tuberculosis for about a year. When I first arrived in the villages, he was very sick. Now he has improved and can stand up. He has joined us in the worship of the Lord four times. Because of his sickness, he has the opportunity to read many books and the Bible, and his spiritual life has advanced quickly. May the Lord heal him quickly. Please pray for him. His name is Chang Peng-ling. Three women have definitely believed in the Lord; they are our neighbors. We thank the Lord for this.</p><p>We feel that the Lord has started His work, and we intend to ask Brother Yu Shung-fei to come and preach the gospel for a few days. May the Lord give him the burden and the opportunity to come. May He save all the people in Shi-Lu-Tou so that He will gain something. Sister Hsiao Yu-yin's nephews and nieces were in Hangchow; she lost contact with them for half a year. Thank the Lord that He has heard our prayer. In May they arrived safely in Shanghai. The elderly Brother Bi wrote that he is doing well in the villages, and he sends greetings to you. The sisters give you their greetings. Greetings to you in the Lord!</p><p>Brother Chang He-nien, July 11</p><h2 class="head2">Lin-Pu, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear Brother David in the Lord:</p><p>I left Ning-Po on June 2 and arrived home on the fourth. On the Lord's Day I gathered some poor, blind, and despised ones, and witnessed the gospel to them. At the invitation of the Yung-Kiang Girls' School in Ting-Shia, I testified to the truth of the gospel at their graduation ceremony. While passing through Si-Kou, I lodged at the True God Chapel. Mrs. Shen (sister of Mrs. Yuen Hou-tsai) and Miss Chang Fan asked me to say something that night. They were still hungry when I left and wanted to have a week of meetings. I promised that I would put this into prayer. I have asked God to grant them grace according to the principle of satisfying the hungry. While I was praying this morning, it seemed that He wanted me to convey this need to you. May the Lord commission His own servant, amen. I intend to go to Shao-Shing at the end of this month. I heard that there will be a conference in Ning-Hai at the beginning of August. I would like to participate in such a feast. The school holiday will be over by the end of August. We are all safe. Please do not worry. Greetings to you in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Yu Yun-fei, July 12</p>
