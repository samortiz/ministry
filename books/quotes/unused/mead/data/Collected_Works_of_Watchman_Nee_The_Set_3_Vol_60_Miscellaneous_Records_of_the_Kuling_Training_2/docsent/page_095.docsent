   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Refutation of the Judaizers'</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Erroneous Interpretation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Lord's Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us see what the Bible says about the Lord's blood and His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, the Bible shows us that redemption is carried out on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Leviticus 4:5 and 7 say that the blood of atonement is shed on the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 20 and 26 show us clearly that as soon as the blood is shed on the altar, God forgives man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once the priest offers the sacrifice on the altar, man's sin is forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no need to enter the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many sins are absolved without the priest entering the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verses 7 and 18 say that for ordinary sins, the priest can offer sacrifices on the altar to absolve a sinner's guilt.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to remember that there is no need to enter the sanctuary for the atonement of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Second, the Judaizers say that before 1844, the Lord remained only in the Holy Place during the 2,300 year period and that He did not enter the inner sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Matthew 27:51 clearly tells us that when the Lord died, the veil in the temple was split from top to bottom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The temple became one, and there was no longer a division into two compartments.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Which compartment are the Judaizers trying to re-enact?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hebrews 9:2-3 and 10:19-20 both show that there are not two compartments in the sanctuary any longer; there is only one place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We are brought directly into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is hard to understand why the Judaizers insist that the Lord was in the Holy Place, the outer compartment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They say that the Lord did not enter the Holy of Holies until 1844.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But before 1844 an entrance was secured for Christians to boldly enter the Holy of Holies already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What a heresy we have here!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to their teaching, prior to 1844 the veil was still with us, and the way to the Holy of Holies was still not manifest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Yet all the while Christians had been able to enter boldly the Holy of Holies!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In other words, Christians entered the Holy of Holies before Christ did.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What a heresy this is!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Judaizers have indeed introduced heretical Jewish teachings into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Third, we have to note that in the atoning work in the Old Testament, only the high priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies; no other person was allowed to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Leviticus 16:17 says, "No man shall be in the tent of meeting when he goes in to make propiation for himself in the holy of holies."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the high priest was making sacrifices of atonement, no one could enter the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the Lord is doing the atoning work in the Holy of Holies, none of us can enter the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is impossible for God to leave the Lord in the Holy Place while fellowshipping with us in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is equally impossible for us to be in the Holy of Holies before the Lord is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Judaizers have confused the gospel completely.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Fourth, another serious problem raised by the Judaizers is that according to them our High Priest, the Lord Jesus, was still making atonement for sin in the Holy Place in 1844.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But how could sin be in the Holy Place at that time?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Judaizers say that the Lord's blood brought sin into the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But we believe that the Lord's blood cleanses us from sin; His blood did not carry our sin into the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a blasphemy to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is a serious heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord accomplished redemption when He died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mrs. White said that the Lord's blood carried our sin to the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What a blasphemy!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In 1 Corinthians 15:17 Paul told the Corinthians that if Christ had not been raised, their faith was futile and they would still be in their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Romans 4:25 also says that the Lord was delivered for our offenses and was raised for our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Before the Lord resurrected, our sins were forgiven already.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason the Lord could resurrect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the Son of God was not successful in redeeming our sins, He could not have resurrected; He would have been detained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But some are saying that before 1844, the problem of sin was still not resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If that is the case, the Lord could not have resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord has indeed resurrected, and our sins are indeed over.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Since the Lord has resurrected, He is no longer in the outer sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This teaching is absolutely unscriptural, and it is a heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Fifth, the Bible tells us that the Lord has entered the Holy of Holies and has appeared before God for us Heb 9:24 , testifying that the sins of those on earth are atoned.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He brought the blood before the throne of grace, which is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When God sees the blood, He answers man's prayer and forgives his sins.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the real fact.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What the Judaizers are saying is heresy, a very serious heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sixth, the Lord Jesus' offering of the sacrifice of sin and His becoming the High Priest are two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Bible only says that the Lord redeemed us from sin by becoming a sacrifice Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It does not say that the Lord became the High Priest for the purpose of atoning our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Hebrews 4:15 and 16 say that the Lord Jesus acts as our High Priest to take care of our weaknesses, not our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Taking care of sin and taking care of weaknesses are two entirely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord is not taking care of our sin in heaven now.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is sympathizing with our weaknesses and interceding for us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Seventh, we have to be clear about the relationship between the Lord becoming our High Priest and His dealing with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hebrews 3:1, 8:1, 10:12, and 12:2 all tell us that as our priest the Lord Jesus has sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty on high.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Since He has sat down, it means that He has finished the cleansing work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the reason He sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Christianity gives us first the sacrifice to deal with our sins before giving us the priest to deal with our weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is not the case with the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>With them the two things occur at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We have to read Hebrew 10:12 to the new ones: "But this One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God."</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He sat down before God before He was a priest to us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The priests in the Old Testament, as Hebrews 10:11 indicates, stood daily before God to minister to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Lord presented His blood to God once, and He sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He did not continue atoning for sin; He sat down.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hebrews 9:26 says, "But now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hebrews 10:17-18 also says that the Lord will not remember our sins and lawlessnesses anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Since the sins are forgiven, there is no need to sacrifice for sin anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>One sacrifice for sin is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Judaizers try to drag us back to the Jewish position of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They do not want us to see the clear redemptive work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is indeed an evil teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have to know that the 2,300 days is the period when the Antichrist will trample under his feet the sanctuary of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Judaizers say that there is the need to purify the sanctuary because the blood brought to the sanctuary carried sin with it, defiling the sanctuary so that the sanctuary must be purified before the Lord can come back.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is another evil teaching of the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We have to reject this heresy utterly.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We cannot have fellowship with Catholics, and we cannot have fellowship with the Judaizers either.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They are blasphemers of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We have no way to communicate with them, because they do not have the right perception of things.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We cannot tolerate any teaching that infringes upon the person or work of Christ; such teaching is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we are careless in this matter, we are not a true lover of the Lord.</S>
