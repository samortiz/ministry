 <h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Fifteen</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE SAVIOR OF MAN</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Acts 4:12; 1 Tim. 1:15; Luke 2:10-11; 19:10</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Man needs a Savior<br />
<span class="normal">Since man needs the way of salvation (refer to Subject 214), man needs a savior. There must be a savior in order that the way of salvation might be accomplished.</span></li>
<li>The Lord Jesus is not a teacher but a Savior
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Throughout all the generations not one sage, philosopher, or religious person could call himself the Savior. At most, such people have been merely religious leaders or teachers.</li>
	<li>Only the Lord Jesus Christ called Himself the Savior. The Bible declares that He is the Savior, and also myriads of Christians throughout the generations testify that He is the Savior.<em> Emphasize this point.</em></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>He is able to save
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord Jesus is God becoming man to be our Savior.</li>
	<li>Since He is God, nothing is impossible with Him. He can both redeem man and deliver him from sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Sixteen</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE SALVATION OF MAN</h2>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Matt. 20:28; 1 Pet. 2:24; John 12:24; 1 Pet. 1:3<br />
<em>The subject of this message is the cross.</em></h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Since a savior is one who saves man, he must accomplish redemption for man</li>
<li>Throughout the generations no sage, human philosopher, or religious leader has ever claimed to have accomplished redemption for man</li>
<li>The Savior is Jesus
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Jesus Himself said that He would accomplish redemption for man, give up His life for man, and be a ransom for man.</li>
	<li><em>Stress the cross in this section.</em>He hung upon the cross in order to bear our sins. The cross is the way of salvation which God prepared for man. When Jesus was on the cross, God put upon Him the sins of all men.</li>
	<li>The Savior not only said that He would give up His life to be a ransom for man, but also that His death would release His life. Because of His resurrection, man is able to obtain His life and be born again.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion, the shedding of His blood, and His death and resurrection are our salvation
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s blood takes care of our sinful deeds.</li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s life takes care of our sinful nature.</li>
	</ol></li>
