<P>Verse 23:"On that day some Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, came to Him and questioned Him." The two parties departed and the Sadducees appeared on the scene; this is like a round-the-clock war. The Sadducees believed that there is no resurrection and that a person is completely terminated after he dies. Hence, they believed that there are neither demons nor angels. Men are prone to develop hypothetical problems to entangle others, just as the Sadducees of old did.</P><P>Verses 24-28:"Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If anyone dies and does not have children, his brother as next of kin shall marry his wife and raise up seed to his brother. Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first married and died, and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother. Likewise also the second and the third until the seventh. And last of all the woman died. In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had her." The supposedly difficult problem, "Now there were seven brothers with us," was absolutely fictitious.</P><P>Verse 29:"And Jesus answered and said to them, You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God." "You err." This was the Lord's judgment concerning them. The phrase "not knowing the Scriptures" indicates that they had no spiritual knowledge. The phrase "nor the power of God" indicates that they had no spiritual experience. These are the reasons for making mistakes. Hence, a believer ought to have both knowledge and experience.</P><P>Verses 30-32:"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying, `I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living." "For in the resurrection" refers to the rapture. "Neither marry nor are given in marriage" does not refer to the angels. The Lord not only pointed out resurrection; what He was saying was: "You say that when a person dies, he is terminated. If that is the case, God should have introduced Himself in the section concerning the bush as `the God of the dead,' and such a God could never have encouraged Moses." The logic here was that God is the God of Abraham; since Abraham is a dead person, this would make God the God of the dead. However, He is not the God of the dead. Therefore, although Abraham is dead, he will become alive again (cf. 8:11). Jacob and Isaac also will be resurrected. Concerning resurrection, see 1 Corinthians 15:50-58.</P><P>Verse 33:"And when the crowds heard this, they were astounded at His teaching." Their being astounded is the indication of defeat. They thought that it was a difficult problem. However, the Lord still was able to answer it. "Astounded" means to marvel.</P><P>Verses 34-35:"But the Pharisees, when they heard that He had muzzled the Sadducees, gathered themselves together. And one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him." The phrase "gathered themselves together" indicates that they regrouped because they sympathized with one another's similar defeats. The lawyer was so proud that he would not admit to being humbled by the Lord's eloquence.</P><P>Verse 36:"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?" The lawyer asked the Lord, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" because a person cannot emphasize one commandment and neglect another (cf. James 2:10).</P><P>Verses 37-38:"And He said to him, `You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' This is the great and first commandment." "The great and first commandment," because it includes the entire law. To violate one of the commandments of the law equals not loving God with "all."</P><P>Verse 39:"And the second is like it: `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'" "Neighbor" refers to anyone besides oneself. The neighbor can also refer to the Lord Jesus. See the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:30).</P><P>Verse 40:"On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets." The two commandments encompass the entire law. The former includes all laws in relation to God, and the latter includes all laws in relation to man. The Ten Commandments were originally divided into two parts, those related to God and those related to man.</P><P>Verse 41:"Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus questioned them." "Jesus questioned them." It seems as if the Lord was saying, "You have asked Me enough questions. Let me now ask you one question."</P><P>Verse 42:"Saying, What do you think concerning the Christ? Whose son is He? They said to Him, David's." "What do you think?" This is parallel to verse 17. This question seems to be one for a three-year-old child. The Lord did not ask a difficult question, because He was afraid that they would not answer (see Matt. 21:27).</P><P>Verses 43-45:"He said to them, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies underneath Your feet'? If then David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?" "The Lord said to my Lord." The first "Lord" is Jehovah, and the second "Lord" is the Messiah. The Lord desires to show us that according to the flesh, Christ is the Son of David. Yet according to the Spirit, He is the Lord of David. The Pharisees knew the Lord only as the Son of David. They were like today's modernists. Thank God that He is also the Lord of David.</P><P>Verse 46:"And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone from that day dare to question Him anymore." The reason they could not answer was that they knew the answer yet were unwilling to answer.</P>
