<h2 class="head2">C. The Rest of the Jews<br />Joining Him in Hypocrisy</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul says, &ldquo;And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy.&rdquo; When the leading one backslid, the rest easily followed. It is almost incredible that Peter, the leading apostle, practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel.</p><p>At least twice in the New Testament we are told that Peter took the lead in a negative way and that others followed him. In John 21 Peter led the way to go fishing. In this he was followed by some of the other disciples. Here in Galatians 2 Peter practiced hypocrisy, and others followed him.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Barnabas Carried Away by Their Hypocrisy</h2><p>Paul points out that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy. Barnabas participated in Paul&rsquo;s first journey to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to raise up the Gentile churches. Even one who had so much fellowship with the Gentile believers was carried away by Peter&rsquo;s hypocrisy. What a negative influence Peter exerted upon others! Surely he deserved to lose his leadership.</p><p>Although there was a prevailing atmosphere in favor of circumcision, Peter should not have been subdued. The Lord had shown him an impressive vision, and he should not have forgotten it. Nevertheless, even though he did not forget the vision, he behaved in a hypocritical way with respect to eating with the Gentiles.</p><h2 class="head2">E. Not Walking Straightforwardly<br />in Relation to the Truth of the Gospel</h2><p>Because Peter and the others were hypocritical, Paul rebuked him when he &ldquo;saw that they did not walk straightforwardly in relation to the truth of the gospel&rdquo; (v. 14). Peter was absolutely wrong, and Paul rebuked him to his face. He would not allow the clear truth of the gospel to be damaged. Probably Paul was the only one with the boldness to rebuke a leading apostle such as Peter. Thank the Lord for Paul&rsquo;s faithfulness. If he had not been faithful there at Antioch, the truth of the gospel might have been blurred.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Compelling Those of the Nations<br />to Live like Jews</h2><p>In front of all, Paul said to Peter, &ldquo;If you, being a Jew, live like the nations and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the nations to live like Jews?&rdquo; To live like the nations is to eat, live, and fellowship with the Gentiles. To live like Jews, or to Judaize (Gk.), is not to eat or have fellowship with the Gentiles.</p><p>We praise the Lord that through Paul&rsquo;s faithfulness the truth of the gospel was preserved. Today it is crystal clear according to the New Testament that in Christ there is no circumcision. We have been set free from slavery under the law and from the bondage of circumcision. There is no need for us to keep the law or to be circumcised. Rather, we only need faith in Christ. Because of Paul&rsquo;s faithfulness and boldness, this truth was preserved and has remained clear for us today. We thank the Lord for this.</p>
