   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REDEMPTION AND SUBSTITUTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we have to ask one question.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Since the Lord Jesus died on the cross and since God made Him the propitiation place, how can we be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the difference between redemption and substitution?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Are they similar in any way?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to realize that the work of the Lord Jesus is a work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the result of this redemptive work is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Redemption is the cause, and substitution is the result.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The scope of redemption is very large.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But the scope of substitution is not quite as large.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is quite interesting that the Bible never says that the Lord Jesus died on behalf of the sins of all.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It only says that the Lord Jesus died on behalf of all 2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His redemptive work was to satisfy the righteous requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Lord accomplished redemption on the cross, this work of redemption had absolutely nothing to do with man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I want to impress you strongly with this word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Redemption is absolutely not related to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The work of redemption is between God and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is the work of redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is God Himself coming to the world to solve the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once the problem of sin is solved, the work of redemption is done.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The blood of the Passover lamb was sprinkled on the side posts and upper posts of the doors Exo 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God said that when He saw the blood, He would pass over the house v. 13 . The blood was for God to see.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was not for the firstborn to see.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The firstborn did not need to see the blood; they stayed in the houses.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The blood was to meet God's righteous requirements; it was not to meet the requirements of the firstborn.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>With the firstborn, there was no such thing as redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we read the Old Testament, we will discover that the blood for the atonement i.e., redemption of sin was brought into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was sprinkled on the veil seven times Lev 16:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the day of Atonement, the high priest had to take the blood and sprinkle it on the mercy seat of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blood was offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is true that the blood had to be smeared on the thumb, the ear, and the toe of a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But that was done with respect to consecration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was a matter of consecration to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Man had no such requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Redemption has to do with God; it is God coming in to solve what man cannot solve by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why the Bible says, "And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for those of the whole world" 1 John 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Redemption includes the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In such a redemption, everyone, even those that have not been saved, are included.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has come and dealt with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus has satisfied God's righteous requirements so that we can receive the substitution of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His redemption is an abstract preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By believing in Him, this redemption becomes a substitution to us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before God, it was not a substitution, but a redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is important to know this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we are not clear about this matter, we will be confused about many other doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Redemption is before God, and substitution is for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Redemption is to satisfy God's requirements, and substitution is for us to receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What He accomplished was redemption; what we have received is substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I do not mean that there is no such teaching as substitution in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is indeed such a teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But all the teachings in the Bible concerning substitution are written for Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are not written for unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To the Gentiles we say that Jesus has died for them and accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To the Christians we say that the Lord Jesus has substituted them in bearing their sins.</S>
