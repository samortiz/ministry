   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>God is omnipotent, but apart from the Bible there is no record about Him in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is even hard to find a record concerning some of the false gods.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But we do have a record about God, that is, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The most wonderful thing on this earth among the human race is this record.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Pentateuch, which the Jews call the Torah, was written by Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moses was not very early; rather, he was at least four hundred years later than Abraham and at least twenty-five centuries later than Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here then is a marvelous question: Where did Moses get all his facts for the writing of the Pentateuch?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Genesis is a record written by Moses, but you cannot find Moses' support for his record.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, people wonder where Moses got the material for Genesis, the account of Adam to Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes Moses gives us a very detailed record, as in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Moses tells of man's fall through the serpent and even gives us the conversation between the serpent and Eve in much detail.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But where did Moses get this material?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From my youth I was told that the verbal record went down through the generations to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But a verbal record is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is sometimes like a snowball: As it goes through the generations, it becomes a big ball with little fact and the rest myth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But if you study Genesis carefully, you cannot find myths.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It seems that everything is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That conversation in chapter three is very reasonable and very much like fact.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, we must believe that while Moses was writing, he was under the moving of the Holy Spirit 2 Pet 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No doubt, there is some verbal tradition, but I believe the main source of Moses' writing was the move of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE HISTORY OF GOD REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THROUGH HUMAN STORIES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The best Bible teachers say that Genesis is a book of history.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Genesis is also a book of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If Genesis were just a book of history, the record concerning Joseph, for instance, would not need to be as long as it is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is strange that only three pages of Genesis are about God's creation, while many pages are about this one man Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Of the fifty chapters of Genesis, thirteen are about Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Why is the record of God's creation so short and the record of this youth named Joseph so long?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must realize that the history of God is not a history related much to the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If Genesis were a full record of God's creation, fifty chapters would not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Scientists today spend not pages but books to tell us about the existence of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Bible is not that kind of history.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible is a history of God in union not with the stars and the heavenly host nor with the beasts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible is a history of God in union with man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Joseph occupies such a long portion of the record because God wants to show us how much He is there in Joseph's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the creation God only said, Let there be light, and there was light.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is no more detail than that.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But when the same writer comes to Joseph, the record is in much detail.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because of the detail, you cannot read the story of Joseph without your affections being touched.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, from reading these details we see that our God in His history is very much related to humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Acts 7 says that when Abraham was still in Chaldea, the God of glory appeared to him v. 2 . Do you know in what way God appeared to Abraham? Genesis 18 gives us a clear record of this.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One day Abraham sat at the door of his tent in the heat of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then suddenly three men came.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Of these three, one was Christ, who is called Jehovah in this chapter vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the two angels who came with Christ left, Christ remained with Abraham, and Abraham talked to Jehovah face to face as he would to another person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This chapter is clear, but it presents a big problem.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ was there in the human form, with a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He even ate Sarah's cooking, and Abraham brought Him water so that He might wash His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This seems to contradict John 1:14, which says that at the time of the incarnation God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How could Christ already be in the flesh long before John 1:14?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is God's history.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moses' writing is very human, yet in this human record you can see God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God lived in this record.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may think that only God's creation of the heavens and the earth is worth recording and that there is no need to have a long record about a youth like Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But do you like to read Genesis chapters one and two more than chapters thirty-seven through fifty?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even if you read chapters thirty-seven through fifty ten times, you will not get tired of them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These chapters are humanly very interesting, but you can see God there.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is God's history in a human story.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Chapters thirty-seven through fifty of Genesis are a man's story, but that story comprises God's history.</S>
