   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Function of the Law of Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The law of life is not there to regulate us from within, telling us what to do and what not to do.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Rather, its main function is to free us from the law of sin and death Rom 8:2 and to conform us to the image of Christ Rom 8:29 so we may express all that God is in our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As we are daily captured by the law of sin, we need to be set free, saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Before we became a Christian, we had no way to free ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The harder we tried not to sin, the more the law of sin was activated.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As Christians, the law of life frees us from the law of sin as we activate our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dealing with the negative things is one aspect of the function of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the positive side, the law of life shapes us, that is, conforms us to the image of Christ, who is the image of the invisible God Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we turn to our spirit every day, the Spirit transforms us in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We might have been rebellious towards our parents before, but, Christ is not rebellious toward His Father Phil 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As we realize that we are rebellious, we must repent to the Lord to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then we should continue to pray and stay in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The law of life spontaneously will work in us, bringing all the elements of Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One such element is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this work we are transformed into His image.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>C. God's Desire is Accomplished by the Law of Life</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The law of life is a wonderful gift that we have received from God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It will work out in us all that God wants to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is not only our God but also our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, He desires to be our God in the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We are not only God's creatures but also His children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, He desires us to be His people in the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God does not desire only to be our God according to the outward law of letter; He desires to be our Father according to the inward law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nothing of the keeping of the outward law of letter can satisfy God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He can only be pleased by our living according to the inward law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And He does not desire to have us only as His creatures without His life but also as His children with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, He wants us to be His people in the law of life, living not according to the outward law of letter but according to the inward law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both His relationship to us and ours to Him should be a relationship maintained in the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the law of letter there was nothing but death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With the law of life there is no death but life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only life can satisfy the divine desire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Praise the Lord that we have had a new birth, a divine birth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this new birth there are no weak points.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is only the divine life with the divine nature and the divine law which shapes us and conforms us to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, this shaping requires the growth in life, for the law of life only functions as life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The law of life does not regulate us from sin, because it is not in the realm of sin; it is in the realm of the divine life where there is no sin, world, flesh, or self.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As life grows, its law works, not mainly to regulate or correct us, but to shape us, to conform us to the image of the Firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, through the function of the law of life, we all shall become the mature sons of God, and God will have His universal, corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE LIGHT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 1:4 tells us, "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.''</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And in John 8:12 Jesus said, "I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but have the light of life.''</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We see that light is very much related to life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A. Life is from Light</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The whole Bible reveals that life comes from the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When light enters, life follows.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Where light is, there life is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The amount of life is in direct proportion to the amount of light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Genesis chapters 1 and 2 say that before God began His recovery work, the entire earth was void and dark, which means that it was filled with death, for darkness is the symbol of death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore the first step of God's work was to command that there be light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When light came, it destroyed the death which belongs to darkness and began to bring in life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, life follows light, and life begins from light.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is a line in the whole Bible which continuously speaks of life and light together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Where light is, there is life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is a great principle in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Psalm 36:9 says, "With thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light.''</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This also clearly speaks of the relationship between life and light.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Life always follows light, and only light can bring forth life.</S>
