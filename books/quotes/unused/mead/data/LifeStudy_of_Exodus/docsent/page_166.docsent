   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. HAVING EXPERIENCED GOD S FULL SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we would enter into fellowship with God, we need to experience His full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be saved from the condemnation of sin, the world, and Satan, as seen in chapters one through fourteen.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then we need to enjoy God s rich provision 15:1 17:7 , conquer the flesh 17:8-16 , and be brought into the kingdom of God 18:1-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we do not have such an experience and enjoyment, we shall not be able to have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our spiritual experience matches the experience of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First we are saved from sin, the world, and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then we enjoy God s provision.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The bitter water is changed into sweet, and we eat of manna, the heavenly food, and drink the living water flowing from the smitten rock.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the enjoyment of these divine provisions, we are equipped to conquer the flesh and subdue it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We should not excuse ourselves by saying that we are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we make such an excuse for ourselves, we shall not come to God s mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The more excuses we make, the more we shall be kept away from the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to say, Yes, I am weak, but the Lord is not weak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have Moses, the heavenly Christ, interceding for me, and I have Joshua, Christ as the life-giving Spirit, dwelling in me and fighting for me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have the living Spirit with the cross operating to deal with our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once the flesh is slain, we are immediately in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then, in the kingdom, we are ushered into God s presence to enjoy fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Exodus certainly is a portrait of our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we consider our experience, we shall realize that it corresponds to the record in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF GOD A. At Mount Sinai</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The children of Israel were brought into the presence of God at Mount Sinai 19:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The significance of Mount Sinai is that it is the place for God to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On Mount Sinai God did not perform miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, He simply spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With God s speaking, there is also the heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the spiritual significance of the mountain of God is that it is the place of God s speaking with God s vision.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, the children of Israel heard God speaking, then they saw the vision.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This vision was of the pattern for God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As we gather together in the meetings of the church, we should have God s speaking with His vision.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In many of the so-called religious services today, there is no speaking of God and no vision from God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What an enjoyment to hear God s direct speaking and to see God s vision in the church meetings!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Meeting after meeting, we may have God s speaking and see more of God s vision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a very great matter to hear God s speaking and to see His vision, especially the vision concerning His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is of vital importance that we go to the genuine mountain of God, to God s mountain on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the record in the Bible, God often spoke from a mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus delivered the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens while on a mountain with His disciples Matt 5:1-2 .</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John was carried away to a high mountain to see the vision of the new heaven and the new earth with the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thus, in our experience we need to come out of Egypt, cross the Red Sea, and journey through the wilderness until we arrive at the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At this mountain we are brought into God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Without His presence, what we say or do means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His presence is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many of us can testify that whenever we gather together into the Lord s name, we enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We hear His speaking, and we see His vision at the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>B. Through Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are brought into the presence of God through sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Exodus 19:10 says, And Jehovah said unto Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and let them wash their clothes Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verses 14 and 22 also speak of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be sanctified is to be separated from the world unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the children of Israel were assembled around Mount Sinai, they were far removed from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They had been separated from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At Mount Sinai they were living in God s presence, having been sanctified, separated, unto God in an absolute way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we gather together in the church meetings, we should also be separated from the world unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Praise the Lord that we are a sanctified people!</S>
