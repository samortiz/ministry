   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE RELEASE OF THE GLORY OF CHRIST'S DIVINITY OUTLINE Through the breaking of the shell of His humanity by His death-John 12:24: He was the unique grain that contained His divine life with His divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When the shell of His humanity was broken through His crucifixion, which was the baptism He went through Luke 12:50 , all the elements of His divinity-His divine life and His divine glory-were released.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this sense, His death is considered the life-releasing death with His glory released simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The release of the glory of Christ's divinity is His being glorified by the Father with the divine glory John 12:23-24 in His resurrection through His death Luke 24:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Christ in His human living prayed that His Father would glorify Him John 17:1 , and the Father answered His prayer Acts 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a glorification is a transfer, transferring Christ from the stage of His incarnation into the stage of His inclusion, in which He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Note: Christ's being glorified was a drastic change not only in His condition and situation but also in His nature, element, and essence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Prayer: Lord, we extol You as the glorified One.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We appreciate and treasure Your being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hallelujah, our Christ is the glorified Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, give us a heart to seek after You as the glorified One, and grant us the up-to-date utterance to release what You have shown us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lord, in this matter we need You and we trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Come in, Lord, to unveil to us more mysteries concerning Your being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The general subject of these messages is the issue of Christ being glorified by the Father with the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to His Father concerning glorification, saying, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" v. 1 . When we speak of glorifying a certain person, we mean that we praise or exalt that person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But this is not what God the Father did to Christ, and this is not what the Lord Jesus asked His Father to do.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, the Lord prayed that the Father would glorify the Son that the Father might be glorified in the Son's glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ's great prayer that God the Father would glorify Him was offered shortly before He was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Immediately after He prayed that prayer, He was arrested and crucified so that He might be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The subject of the previous message was the concealed glory of Christ's divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In that message we saw that Christ as the second of the Triune God possessed the divine glory from eternity past and that His humanity, His flesh, through His incarnation became a shell to conceal the glory of His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this message we will consider the release of the glory of Christ's divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need to see that the glory of Christ's divinity, which was concealed in the shell of His flesh, has been released.</S>
