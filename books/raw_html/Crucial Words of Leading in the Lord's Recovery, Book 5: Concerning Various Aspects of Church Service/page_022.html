	 <h2 class="head2">Having No Choice in the Work</h2>
<p>After I entered the work of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, I never chose where to work. I simply did as I was told. Wherever the work sent me, I went. Most of the time I was sent to a place where the work was experiencing difficulty, but by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy I never made my own choices. Wherever the work sent me, I went. When the work sent me to Taiwan, another brother was sent to assist me with the Hok-kien dialect. However, this brother did not come to Taiwan, because he felt that Taiwan was backward. Many years later I went to America and stayed with Brother Samuel Chang for a time. I had much fellowship with him. He told me that when I was laboring in mainland China, some of the workers thought that I was rather na&#239;ve concerning the work, because I went wherever I was told to go, and I did whatever I was asked to do. This is the attitude that we should have. We hope that we will all learn to be na&#239;ve in this way.</p>
<p>The wife of Brother Abraham Chang lived in Shanghai and helped with the literature work in 1940. She can testify that I was indeed rather na&#239;ve. I did not speak much, unless I was giving a message. You would not hear my voice in the co-workers&rsquo; meetings. Coming to labor in Taiwan was the right thing to do. More Chinese people congregate in Taiwan than anywhere else. None of the other countries&mdash;Hong Kong, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, or Thailand&mdash;can match Taiwan. Taiwan is the best place for the work, and it is greatly blessed by the Lord. No one can deny this. Thirty years ago no one would choose to come to Taiwan, but today the churches here are being blessed. No human hand could accomplish this. It was accomplished by the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING FOLLOWERS</h2>
<p>We should not have a group of followers. Every business requires its employees to be followers, but we in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must not have a following. I do not have a following. Wherever I go, I am with the local saints. When the Lord took me from Chefoo to Shanghai, I did not take a following with me. The saints who assisted me and coordinated with me spoke the Shanghai dialect. When I went to America, I did not have a following. I did not take a co-worker from Taiwan, and I did not use any co-worker from Taiwan, because what was useful in Taiwan might not have been useful in America. Taking a group of followers from Taiwan to America would have been a hindrance.</p>
<p>If we have a group of followers when we labor in the schools, we will take our followers with us when we are reassigned to work in the small groups. When we are reassigned from one area of service to another, we should go by ourselves and not take any followers with us. This has become a common problem among us: wherever we work, we take a group of followers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING NATURAL RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>A group of followers is an indication that we have natural relationships with others. In our service we cannot have natural relationships with others. We should not have a group of saints with whom we agree in taste and temperament. This is poison. Those who have a natural relationship discuss everything with each other. The Chinese describe such close friendships as breathing through the same nostrils. The Lord sent the disciples out two by two, but He did not allow them to have natural relationships. Even though Peter, John, and James were always together, in John 21 the Lord told Peter, &ldquo;When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go&rdquo; (v. 18). In verse 21 Peter asked what John&rsquo;s future would be, and the Lord replied, &ldquo;If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me&rdquo; (v. 22). The Lord&rsquo;s response implied that they must not have anything natural among them.</p>
<p>When the Roman Empire was persecuting the believers, Peter, John, and James were not martyred together. James was martyred first and then Peter, but John was exiled to the island of Patmos. Although we are brothers and sisters and members one of another, there should never be a situation of natural relationships among us. Many corrupt things come out of natural relationships. The points of this fellowship are to inoculate us. Please remember these points. As we continue in the Lord, these things will be manifested among us, not only in the younger serving ones but also in the older serving ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING A PURE PERSON</h2>
<p>We need to learn the lesson to be a pure person, that is, a person who trusts in the Lord. We also need to learn to be simple members in Christ&rsquo;s Body, knowing only the Body and the Head, not having our own &ldquo;clique,&rdquo; not having any natural relationship, and not having any following. A following is a little sect. We should not have a following in our own locality, nor should we have a following in other localities. Our co-workers are the co-workers of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. When I come to Taiwan, the co-workers in Taiwan are my co-workers. When I am in America, the co-workers there are my co-workers. When I go to Germany, the co-workers there are my co-workers. It is the same when I go to Brazil. I have so many co-workers because I do not have a following of co-workers. Instead, all the co-workers are my co-workers. Having a following shows that we are sick and divisive, that is, sectarian. This principle applies in one locality and in many localities.</p>
<p>Those who have a heart to serve the Lord should learn this lesson from their youth. They should learn not to have a competitive, comparing spirit but a pure spirit. They should be willing to serve the Lord and give the Lord an outlet. We thank the Lord when He blesses Hong Kong, and we thank Him when He blesses Yungho. We are here learning our weaknesses and also learning from the strengths of others. This is to have a right spirit.</p>
<p>If there are small groups that do well in the future, we all must learn from their strong points and their merits. If the children&rsquo;s work does well, we also need to learn from the children&rsquo;s work. We should never compete or be jealous over one another, nor should we have our own choice. It is only in this way that we can maintain the Lord&rsquo;s blessing and maintain our longevity in the Lord&rsquo;s service. We need to be kept by the Lord; otherwise, we will not last in the service. We must learn these lessons every day so that we can remain in the Lord&rsquo;s work and allow Him to use us to bring His blessing.</p>
