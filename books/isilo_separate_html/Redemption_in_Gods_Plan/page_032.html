<h1 class="title">THE APPROPRIATION<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="title">CONSECRATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:14-15; Rom. 6:13</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST STEP IN APPROPRIATING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION&mdash;FAITH</h2>
<p>We appropriate the redemption that God has accomplished in Christ for us through faith. Once we believe, that is, receive the Lord by believing, we obtain God&rsquo;s redemption. Hence, believing is the first step toward appropriating God&rsquo;s redemption. In this step we turn from being sinners to being believers, from being worldly to being sanctified, from being in darkness to being in light, and from being in death to being in life. This is a great step.</p>
<p>Even though this is a great step, it is not complete. This step merely causes us to receive, not to enjoy, God&rsquo;s redemption. Although believing imparts God&rsquo;s life into us, it is not enough to cause this life to grow in us. After we receive God&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s life, we need a further step to enjoy His redemption so that His life may grow in us. Thus, there is a need for another step to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECOND STEP IN APPROPRIATING<br />
GOD&rsquo;S REDEMPTION&mdash;CONSECRATION</h2>
<p>The second step in the appropriation of God&rsquo;s redemption is consecration. Once we receive God&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s life by faith, we must consecrate ourselves to God to enjoy His redemption so that His life can grow in us. We must take the steps of faith and consecration in order to receive and enjoy God&rsquo;s redemption, that is, to appropriate God&rsquo;s redemption fully.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Consecration</h2>
<p>To believe is to receive God and everything of God, and to consecrate is to hand over ourselves and everything to God. Receiving is by believing; handing over is by love. When we believe, we receive everything that God has accomplished and prepared for us in Christ by faith. When we consecrate, we hand over ourselves and our everything to God because of love. By faith we receive God and everything of God; that is, we receive God&rsquo;s redemption. By handing over ourselves in love we enjoy God and everything of God; that is, we enjoy God&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Purpose of Consecration</h2>
<p>The purpose of God&rsquo;s redemption is to conform us to the image of His Son (Rom. 8:29). God accomplishes this purpose by working the life of His Son into us through the Spirit. He works in us so that His life will grow in us unto maturity, and we will fully bear the image of His Son. Ephesians 2:10 says, &ldquo;We are His masterpiece.&rdquo; This speaks of God&rsquo;s work in us, not of our doing anything for Him. After we receive His life through redemption, God does a work of life in us so that His life will grow in us unto maturity, and we will have His image fully. However, in order for Him to work in us, He must have our consent, which is our consecration. Our consecration is our giving Him the consent to work in us as He pleases.</p>
<p>Carpenters who work on wood and craftsmen who work on various materials have no need of consent from lifeless materials. Such materials have no consciousness or opinions. But God cannot work in us without our consent, because we have the highest form of created life. We are persons who have consciousness, opinions, preferences, and choices. If we do not want God to work in us and do not consent to let Him work in us, He will be restricted in His work in us. As living persons, we have deep emotions and a strong will. Consequently, if our will does not allow God to work in us or if our emotions do not accept God&rsquo;s work in us, God will have no way in us. After our salvation our consent is needed in order for God to work in us. Our consent is our handing over ourselves to Him completely and our letting Him work in us freely. This is consecration.</p>
<p>Many people think that consecration is related to our working for God; this is preached quite often. However, the primary meaning of consecration is not that we would work for God but instead that we would let God work in us. God is responsible for everything in His plan of redemption. God has done some things for us, but He desires to do still more things in us. In order to receive the things that God has done, we need faith. However, in order to receive the things that God still desires to do in us, we need to consent to His work in us through consecration. In our believing we receive what God has done for us; in our consecration we allow God to do what He still wants to do in us. If we do not believe, we cannot receive what He has done for us, and if we do not consecrate ourselves, we are not letting Him do what He wants to do in us. If we believe but do not consecrate ourselves, we will receive what He has done for us, but He will be unable to do what He still wants to do. Hence, after we believe and receive what He has done for us, He wants us to consecrate ourselves so that He may continue to work in us.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
