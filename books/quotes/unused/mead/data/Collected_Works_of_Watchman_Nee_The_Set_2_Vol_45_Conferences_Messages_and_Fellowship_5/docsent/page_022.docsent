   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IS THE OPINION OF THE MANY THE WILL OF GOD?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once Brother Luan was working in a certain place in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He felt within that he should leave, and he even had a dream that he should leave.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But the local brothers begged him to tarry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He had planned to leave at 6:00 p.m., but he eventually changed his mind and agreed to leave at 9:00 p.m. But when he was about to leave, the government sent men to him and he could no longer leave.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The result was quite bad.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Should he have obeyed the brothers and not been independent?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Or should he have gone along with the leading within?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>My answer is that the Bible only tells us to submit to the Body; it never tells us to submit to a corpse or to the temperament of certain people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The "hooliganism" in Southeastern Asian countries cannot be a fair representation of God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people consider Christian meetings as a kind of entertainment or a diversion from their daily humdrum.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I were Brother Luan, I would have asked, "Did you pray about your request?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If this is something from yourself, please drop it."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Only after you have questioned in this way is there any reason to consider staying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many people are looking for nothing but spiritual excitement.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am not afraid that my words will spread to Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once I was invited to visit the brothers in Southeast Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They told me that they had problems and that they needed help.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I arrived, I told them that I had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The brothers then said, "We would like you to share a word about nothing.'"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At the beginning of the meeting, almost everyone was an usher.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They brought many unbelievers and worldly ones into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At the end of the meeting, I asked the brothers and sisters, "Are you trying to receive help in this conference for yourselves or are you trying to help others?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is wrong for us to follow the flesh, be it one man's flesh or the majority's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The name Laodicea means "the opinion of the people."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Believers should not follow the majority, because the majority may not be right.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A worker's itinerary should not be dictated by others or by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He has to pray before the Lord, and the Lord has to decide for him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God rewards the simple believers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is the most terrible thing for one to be ignorant of God's will and to lead others into ignorant things at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brother Luan had fallen into the hands of robbers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>PROPER GUIDANCE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sister Lee asked: Some time ago someone cabled and extended an invitation to me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I did not know if I should go.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Answer: Consider the question of paying the tax in Matthew 17.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was not something that one should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In doing anything we should ask if we are doing it in the light or in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If something is of the Lord, we will surely sense that we are in the light when we do it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if we feel that something is wrong, we should stop immediately, because if something is questionable, it is in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sometimes we go along with the brothers, not because we are clear about God's will, but because we do not know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if we go along with our brothers, we should first find out how a thing should be done before we go along with them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The sheet that Peter saw was not the church Acts 10:9-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only the "tent" that Paul spoke of was the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Galatians 3:28 says, "There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that there is neither Greek nor Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Christ there are only those who are Christ's. All those who are Christ's are the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, in the church there are no Greeks or Jews, slaves or free men.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the church there are no individual "men"; there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Galatians 3:26-27 says, "For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE WORK OF THE CROSS IN MAN</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Before the cross operates in man, his zeal can become ambition, his prayer can become accusations, his love for the brothers can become factious, and the power of the Spirit can be turned into an opportunity for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The key to the issue lies in this: Does the cross come before the work or does the work come before the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether or not a man is proper before God depends on the amount of work that the cross has accomplished in him.</S>
