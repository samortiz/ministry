   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Letter from Sister Sun Wen-hwa</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sent from Denmark to London</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Dear Brother Nee:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Enclosed please find a letter from Miss H. to me, which she requested that I send to you after I have read it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have read it through.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that you have left Kilcreggan, so I have changed the address and directed the letter to London.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Miss H. and others would like to discuss some questions related to the church based on your book Rethinking Our Work, particularly, concerning chapter five.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>She intends to call a little gathering in her home, including church leaders, and invite you to have a private talk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the Lord leads you to accept such an invitation, you will be able to freely express the message that the Lord has revealed in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mr. Fjord Christensen and we are very happy for the help your book has rendered us a few chapters have been translated into Danish . I have sent him the few chapters which are already translated, and whenever I finish the rest, I will send them to him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He has read the chapters to brothers and sisters in small prayer meetings all over Denmark.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are particularly thankful to the Lord for the fact that these chapters have laid a good foundation in the hearts of the majority of those who have heard them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was indeed the right time for the Lord to arrange to have this book released.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During one meeting two sisters did not understand anything during the first forty-five minutes, yet as Mr. Christensen kept reading, the Holy Spirit suddenly opened their understanding, and they realized that the book was an answer to their recent desperate prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were praying for the Lord to show them the plan of His church on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They were forced to join the local Pentecostal denomination because they thought that they should be in some kind of more organized church, even though they were outside the state church.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now they know that the Lord has prepared a better plan for them, and they subsequently dropped the matter of joining the Pentecostal Church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Presently, some are meeting in four small local meetings and sincerely praying and asking the Lord to show them who should bear the responsibility of the eldership so that they can express and carry out the plan the Lord has accomplished among them in God's house.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Two nights ago I attended a prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After Mr. Christensen read chapter five and part of chapter ten of your book, the Spirit was clearly working.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Most of the people understood and treasured this truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Mr. Christensen has received letters from places that he visited recently, and they related how this truth has deeply penetrated their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In one place a brother received a message in tongues, and after its interpretation, he realized that it was a message concerning the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time he did not understand the meaning of this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He was concerned whether it was a dubious message.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This happened before Mr. Christensen visited.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After he heard Mr. Christensen reading chapter five concerning the church and the churches, it suddenly occurred to him that this church truth was what the Lord had spoken to him in his prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was ready to accept the message of this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are praying much for the meeting in Helsingor in October.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord that He has preserved our hearts in peace in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have no doubt that the Lord has waited for such a long time to give you this light because He knows that our faith has to pass through tests.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Greetings to you and the brothers and sisters in Honor Oak.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sister in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sun Wen-hwa, September 22</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>South Fukien</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's leading in these days seems to be in the evangelization work of the surrounding villages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On September 2 Brother Jai-seng, two other brothers, Mrs. Hwang Bi-hou, and I went to work in Ping-Hai eighty to ninety miles from Pu-Tien by the sea . There are many children of the Lord who are in need of truth and testimony there.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the day time we preached the gospel in the open air in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the evenings we gathered together for meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every night we had about two hundred people; the opportunity was quite great.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On September 12 we returned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sisters Wang Yu-chu and Chen Tien-leh preached the gospel in the homes of sisters in Shi-Cheng Village near Jiang-Kou, and the Lord saved some there.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result we went there in September and did some work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We found some who are seeking God, and hopefully, the Lord's table will be set up.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Presently, Brothers Jai-seng and Kwang-ru and Sisters Weigh Kwang-ying and Fang Chiung-ying will pioneer in areas around Wu-Tung.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Their route leads into the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord has used Brothers Keh Yu-tang and Keh Lien-min to save and revive some there.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sooner or later the Lord's table will be established, and the testimony of the church will be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord willing, I intend to set out with Brother Lan Jin-yang.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>May the Lord accomplish the work He set out to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Please pray much for the co-workers in this part.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers in the Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Tsai Tse-chung, Chen Ke-san, September 30</S>
