   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We have to come back to the Bible in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To spread the kingdom of God on this earth, to propagate Christ in the human race, to preach His good news to save sinners, is a crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we will dive into it without reservation, we will be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All of our natural way, disposition, and character should be crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not be natural in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our going out, our way of speaking may be too natural.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the four Gospels, the Lord Jesus did not talk to people in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every word out of His mouth was very new, fresh, and refreshing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He talked in one way to the Samaritan woman.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He talked in another way to Nicodemus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He talked in still another way to Zaccheus, a sinful tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is because He did not speak from Himself; instead, He spoke His Father's word John 12:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even the Lord Jesus had to deny Himself when He spoke to people, putting aside whatever was His and taking the Father's word, the Father's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He was the first one to be discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was the Father's disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in Matthew 11:29 the Lord said, "Learn from Me."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Greek, the base meaning of the word "disciple" is to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A disciple is a learner.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, this is not to learn in the worldly sense; it is to learn by our old man being crucified to take away all of our old, natural things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we go to visit all the ones whom we have baptized, we should not speak one word out of ourselves in a natural way or express anything without being dealt with or crossed out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we can have a positive result.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To preach the gospel is the most difficult thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You cannot be loose in preaching the gospel to unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gospel preaching needs your impact, your ability, and even your skill.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To get people saved is a top skill.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Brother Watchman Nee was about nineteen or twenty, he preached the gospel very much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One day Brother Nee talked to a very smart, young college student about the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This young man answered: "I am sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>My father is now in Hades suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not like to see that my father will be suffering there, and I will be saved into paradise, so I will go to him to suffer with him."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How would you answer such a person?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Brother Nee answered in a brief and concise way using Luke 16: "The suffering, rich man begged Abraham to send someone to preach the gospel to his five brothers because he loved his brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Don't you believe that your father, although he is suffering in Hades, still loves you?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He doesn't want you to go there with him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you would go there, as you have said, you would not be honoring your father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You would be dishonoring him."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This short word convinced that young man, and he said, "I honor my father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For his sake I believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I will not go to his place, just for his sake."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This example shows us that there is much for us to learn in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In our full-time training, we give lessons on items such as the all-inclusive Christ, the church, and the basic truths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is because we need the equipment; otherwise, we are too natural.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must endeavor to get into the truths to become fully equipped 2 Tim 3:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We do not know what kind of person we will face, and we do not know what kind of knowledge we will need to convince that particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without the knowledge and the skill, we may lose many people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother D. L. Moody preached the gospel very much.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One night after preaching the gospel, he was speaking to a lady concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At a certain point, a disturbance frustrated that lady from being saved at the very time that she should have been touched by the Spirit and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moody testified that after this small disturbance, he could not bring that lady back to the point of receiving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To preach the gospel is a fine matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am concerned that we may go out with a good heart, yet with a very loose manner, character, and disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we go to visit people, we must be on the alert, yet we should not let them know we are so serious since that might threaten them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must learn the ways of preaching the gospel with all the detailed points in order to deal with every situation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You may consider that this is too hard, but the most precious things are always hard to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To go to visit sinners in order to preach your dear and precious Savior to them is altogether a matter in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you do not exercise your spirit or keep yourself speaking in your spirit, you cannot be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You have to learn by being discipled.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You can use The Mystery of Human Life, but it depends on how you use it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You may use it to kill people, or you may use it to enliven people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It all depends upon your way, your skill, your spirit, and your disposition.</S>
