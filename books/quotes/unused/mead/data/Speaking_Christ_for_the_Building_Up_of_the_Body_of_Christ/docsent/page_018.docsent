   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FIRST HOME MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After baptizing a new one, immediately have the first home meeting with him for one hour, teaching him the Lord as the life-giving Spirit indwelling his regenerated spirit and leading him to pray by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You should stay there for at least one hour; the longer you can stay with him, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do not be greedy for numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You have one person already and you should be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You have one treasure; do not let it go.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Stay with this person to give him his first lesson, taking as much time as the situation allows.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first lesson is to tell this new one that the very Savior in whom he has believed and whom he has received, Jesus Christ, today is the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not consider this as a deeper teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is not a deeper teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Charge him to learn the alphabet.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of the ABCs, this is A. Do not be afraid to spend too much time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The longer the time is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Tell him that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the Spirit, He is just like the air.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is everywhere; He is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Tell him that the Lord as the Spirit is now within him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then tell him that he also has a human spirit and that this is the right organ for him to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Most people do not know that each human being has a spirit as a particular organ for him to contact God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Illustrate to him that, if he did not have two eyes, he could not realize color, and that if he did not have two ears, he could not realize sound.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If he does not exercise his spirit, there will be no way for him to realize that God is Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Tell him that the Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit, that he has a spirit, and that this divine Spirit abides in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After this, tell him that to pray is simply to call on the Lord Jesus who is now the Spirit within him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then lead him to pray by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Tell him that from that day he is a person who has Christ the Lord within him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is not a non-Christian who does not have the Lord Jesus within him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather, the Lord Jesus is in him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Bring him into such knowledge and lead him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Tell him that in any problem he might face he should call on the Lord and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This must be included in the first lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you speak with a new one on each point, you have to open a proper verse to him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning the Lord being the life-giving Spirit you must open to 1 Corinthians 15:45b, point it out to him, and help him to read that portion: The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Ask him to read it, once, twice, and a third time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Also, ask him to read loudly, not merely shouting, but as a calling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Lead him to say, How good, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now You are a life-giving Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You may also choose a verse concerning the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You can use John 4:24: God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Tell him that this spirit is his human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Give him verses in this way, but do not give him too many at the most three or four.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Read these verses and help him to become familiar with them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must do this one thing immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not wait until the next day to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if he would say that he does not have much time, still beg him to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Tell him that you want to spend this golden time with him for his sake and his benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have found that this will render much help.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Immediately after his baptism, in the first meeting, build up such a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what will help him to lay a very good foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times in the past, we gave this first lesson too late.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>MEETING WITH THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Continue to have home meetings with the new ones once every three days for the first month to raise them in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You need to go back to visit the new ones within not more than three days.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In one month s time you should visit them ten times, three days apart.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then after the first month, change to visiting them once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Continue to have home meetings with them once a week for two or three months.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>During these two or three months, you will look into their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Different persons will have different situations.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to their situation, you should try to help them realize that Christians should be flocked together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christians cannot be independent, separate, or far away from other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They need to meet with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Try your best to bring them into one of the nearby small group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Also try during these two or three months to bring them into the bigger meetings, especially on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, in the first month, when you visit them ten times, you do not need to bring them to the small group meetings or the bigger meetings unless they ask about them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They may ask if you have a church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do not say that you do not, asking, What do you mean by the church?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do you mean the church building?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If they ask if you have a church, you should ask them if they would like to go.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If they answer yes, then make arrangements to bring them the following Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is just to fit in with their feeling and their need.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have to take care of a new one in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Otherwise, you will spoil the entire situation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We hope that within half a year, everyone will be brought into the regular church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But we still need to go to help them in their home meetings up to the end of one year.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Also, we should lead them to practice what we are doing in preaching the gospel and helping the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After one year, we must have the confidence that they have been brought into the church life and can serve the Lord in the church on their own without our help.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>At that time we can make it clear to them that they should serve the Lord in the church and do the things that we have been doing.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This implies that within that one year, especially in the second half of the year, we must teach them as a coach how to go with us to knock on people s doors for the preaching of the gospel and how to take care of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We should instruct them and lead them to do what we are doing, hoping that within one year they will be raised up in the church life.</S>
