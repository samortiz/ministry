   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVE AS THE BASIS FOR SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to 21:2, a Hebrew slave was to be set free after serving his master six years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If he obtained a wife and children during his years as a slave, he was to leave them as the property of his master and go out by himself v. 4 . However, the slave might plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free v. 5 . Here we see that continuing as a slave is not a legal requirement; it is a matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the slave loved his master, his wife, and his children, he did not want to go out free.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, he would serve his master forever.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Love is the basis of his continued service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is often said that love blinds people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In a very real sense, if we would love others, we should be blind toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Concerning ourselves, however, we must be a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Love requires sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without sacrifice, there can be no love.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus loved us by being a sacrifice for us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 5:2 says, Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ gave Himself for us, dying a malefactor s death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This proves that love demands sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a brother is not willing to sacrifice himself, he cannot love his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, parents must be willing to sacrifice for their children if they are to love their children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no love without sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to 21:5, it was possible that a slave might not want to be free.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Out of love for his master, wife, and children, he might prefer to remain under bondage as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not a matter of legal requirement; it is motivated by voluntary love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus loves God, the church, and all His people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God is His Master, the church is His wife, and all His people are His children.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Testament reveals this threefold love of the Lord Jesus for the Father, the church, and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to John 14:31, the Lord loves the Father; according to Ephesians 5:25, Christ loves the church; and according to Galatians 2:20 and Ephesians 5:2, Christ loves all the believers, all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Motivated by such a love, He was willing to be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Love is the motive and the prerequisite of being a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A SLAVE S POSITION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Exodus 21:6 speaks of the slave being brought to the door or to the doorpost.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In ancient times slaves were to stand by the doorpost waiting for the master s orders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead of doing anything on their own, they were to act only according to the word of the master.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today our position as slaves of Christ should also be at the doorpost.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, in 21:6 we are told that the master bored his slave s ear through with an awl.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This indicates that the slave s ear was opened to listen to the master.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Many Christians are serving God, but they do not stand by the doorpost, and their ear has not been bored through with an awl.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They act on their own, not in accord with what they hear from the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They do many things according to their own concepts, desires, and intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>SLAVES OF CHRIST IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As those who believe in Christ, we all must be His slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should say, O Lord, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even if I have the freedom to go out, I do not want to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I love You, I love Your church, and I love Your children.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the one hand, we may testify of how enjoyable and glorious the church life is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On the other hand, in the church life we all must become slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The New Testament as well as the Old indicates that God s people need the spirit of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The elders in the churches need to realize that if they are not willing to be slaves, they cannot be proper elders.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every elder must be a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This was the reason the Lord Jesus taught His disciples not to seek to be above others, but instead to place themselves lower than others and be their slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the church life there is no rank.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are all brothers, and we all must serve as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the past we have given hundreds of messages on life, the Spirit, Christ, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, if we would apply these messages, we must be slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those who are not willing to have the spirit of a slave cannot enter into all these messages in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the past certain ones testified that they loved the church and were willing to consecrate themselves to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>However, eventually these very ones left the church life, and some even became opposers of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Deep within them they had the ambition for position.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Because this ambition could not be fulfilled in the church life, they left the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Only those who are willing to be slaves can remain permanently in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No matter how I may be treated by the saints, I have no choice but to remain in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church is the home of my Father and of all His children.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I am simply one of His slaves, loving Him, loving the church, and loving His children.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After giving so many messages on life, the Spirit, Christ, and the church, I am glad to give this message on slavery.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This word is for us all.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>LOVE AND OBEDIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we have the spirit of a slave and the love of a slave, it will be easy for us to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Love is always followed by obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This can be illustrated by the relationship between parents and their children.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In a very real sense, good parents must sometimes obey their children.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Often parents obey their children more quickly than the children obey the parents.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The point here is that love produces obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only a slave can obey.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>A good parent is one who has the love and obedience of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Deep within, a mother who loves her children is willing to be a slave to them and do anything for them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Why do parents sometimes obey their children?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>They obey out of love.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Love is the prerequisite of obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>My burden in this message has been to emphasize three matters: the spirit of a slave, the love of a slave, and the obedience of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we have a slave spirit, a slave love, and a slave obedience, we shall be able to keep the commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At first, this word may sound strange.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But if you consider it honestly, you will see that it is true in our practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Only a person with the spirit, love, and obedience of a slave can keep God s ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the New Testament economy, as well as in the Old Testament, there is the need of such a spirit, love, and obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now we can see why God puts the ordinance concerning slaves first and why the slave here is a type of Christ, the true slave.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As those who believe in Christ, belong to Him, and have His life of sacrifice, we also must be slaves loving God, the church, and God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>With such a love as our motivation, we need to be slaves sacrificing and serving.</S>
