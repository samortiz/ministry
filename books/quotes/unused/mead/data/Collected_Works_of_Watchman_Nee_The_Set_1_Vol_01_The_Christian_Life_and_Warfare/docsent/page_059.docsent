   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We also read of a "cool spirit" in Proverbs, the "heat of spirit" in Ezekiel, while it is said of John the Baptist that as a result of his wilderness time of fellowship with God, he got a "strong spirit," strong enough to go and face Herod, and to proclaim a message which was objectional to Jew and Gentile.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We are needing for this spiritual warfare with principalities and powers, just such a strong spirit; a cool spirit, a fervent spirit, a spirit ruled, for "he that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city" in co-action with the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The trouble to-day is the lack of knowledge of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Men are so "soulish," and even Christians walk as natural' men, viewing everything from the natural standpoint "of the earth, earthy" with only the natural vision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Or, on the other hand, "spiritual" men do not understand how to "rule the spirit"; how to keep it "cool," as well as "fervent"; nor do they realize the danger of the power of darkness interfering with their spirits; nor the temptations of the spiritual sphere from forces of evil working upon, or driving their spirit out of steady co-operation with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you get this light from God's Book, you will be able to read everything to-day without perplexity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You will see that the "spirit of the age" Ephes. ii.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2 is a driving spirit, and that the forces of the spiritual realm have come upon us, demanding an understanding of what these forces are, and how we are to meet them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Next, notice the powers of the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The spirit is capable of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul said his "spirit" was refreshed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not say that his heart was refreshed, but his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In one of his missionary journeys he says he was "pressed in spirit," showing that there is a pressure of spirit, which requires an understanding of what it means, so as to know thereby the leading of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A great deal of our supposed "spiritual experiences" are soulish, that is to say they take place in the realm of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our demand is for something we can "feel" in the soulish realm, and not for something we may KNOW in the inner shrine of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul knew he was "bound" in the spirit, and that indicated, by the witness of the Holy Spirit, that "bonds and afflictions" awaited him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He knew, too, when his spirit was released, and the pressure and difficulties had passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As clearly as you understand the senses of the body, he understood the actions of his spirit, and of the Holy Spirit in and through his spirit as His channel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through eyes and ears you understand the physical realm, and through the spirit you know the spiritual realm, and read the communications of God's will made known by the Holy Spirit Rom viii.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>16 , which are always in harmony with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Again, Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord," and that magnifying came into the soul-realm; but she added "my SPIRIT hath rejoiced in God my Saviour."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Acts xix.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>21, "Paul PURPOSED IN SPIRIT to go to Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That is a very different thing from purposing in the mind, for it includes a knowledge of God's will in the spirit, and a purpose to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our Lord Jesus Christ was "troubled IN SPIRIT," and when He went to the grave of Lazarus, we read in the margin that "He groaned in Himself with INDIGNATION IN HIS SPIRIT."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such an indignation in the spirit precedes an outbursting of victory over the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He stood by the grave of Lazarus, and with a loud voice, said, "Lazarus, come forth!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He went to that grave with His Spirit groaning with indignation against the prince of death, and in the outflashing of that indignation, Lazarus was loosed from the captivity of death, and raised to life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this story of Lazarus we have a glimpse of the source of spiritual authority over the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not the authority of words, nor the authority of Christ given to the natural man; but the authority of Christ communicated through the Spirit of God in action through the spiritual man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those who take the aggressive against the Prince of this world in their own soul power, will find their words empty of spiritual force see 1 Cor iv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now notice further that the spirit of the man is under the control of the will: The spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets" subject to the control of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Again note the words of Solomon, "He that ruleth his spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You, as a new creation in Christ, joined to Him in spirit, must rule the mind 1 Pet i.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>13 , rule the body 1 Cor ix.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>27 , rule the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you fail to rule the spirit, the spirit can carry you beyond God's measure, as much as the soul can carry you out of control.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In many things we hear of to-day about ecstatic experiences, there is an element of great danger, lest the spirits of these believers are carried beyond the control of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is almost a new danger in the Church of Jesus Christ which we have now to face.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Church has been so carnal in the past, that now when numbers are becoming "spiritual," the danger lies in not knowing the laws of the spirit, and the forces in the spiritual realm able to affect the spirit, as the thought-world affects the soul.</S>
