<p>I have observed that some small groups are going on strongly, but others are not doing so well. I have studied this situation with some brothers, and we came up with ten factors that deaden a small group. A small group that suffers from one of these ten factors will fall into a deadened situation.</p>
<p>First, if a meeting is too long or drags on it becomes deadened. There is a common fault among the saints who meet regularly. One saint may feel that a point has not been covered sufficiently. Fearing that others might not be clear, he takes five minutes to strengthen the point. Then another saint feels that the point is still not complete and something needs to be added. In this way the meeting drags on, and the spirit of the meeting collapses and dies. Although explanations are necessary, as long as the main points are stated, there is no need to repeatedly add explanations until the meeting cannot be rescued.</p>
<p>Second, a meeting will be deadened if it is disorganized and without focus. Every Life-study message has a subject. We need to grasp the subject, speak it strongly, and then conclude with it so that every person in the meeting knows the content of the message. We should never allow small details to distract us. When the saints do not know the subject, the meeting will become disorganized and without focus.</p>
<p>Third, a meeting will be deadened by the spread of gossip and the stirring up of discord. After meeting for a while, the saints become familiar with each other, and it is easy to chat about different things that can stir up gossip and discord. The small group should be a place that supplies life. When the saints begin to gossip, the small group becomes a place to spread germs. We must ensure that no gossip originates from our meetings. Otherwise, the gossip will be passed on to another person in another small group, and eventually the entire church will be contaminated.</p>
<p>Fourth, a meeting will be deadened if a person gives a message and the rest criticize. When a person continually expresses his feeling or his view, others may not interrupt him, but inwardly they will criticize him. Because we have heard many messages, we have become experts in critiquing. We should avoid this. In a small group it is best that no one gives a message or criticizes.</p>
<p>Fifth, a meeting will be deadened if the meeting is inflexible and routine. When we do not care whether or not the saints enjoy reading the message but instead insist on covering the message according to a schedule, we are not flexible.</p>
<p>Sixth, a meeting will be deadened if the meeting is full of anecdotes and reminiscences. A person may appear to be using the Life-study, but he is actually recounting an event that occurred many years ago. It is rather easy for those who have been saved for many years to tell stories. In principle, it is best to share a new experience. In other words, we should speak about our recent enjoyment of the Lord over the past week. This surely will bring a fresh feeling to others.</p>
<p>Seventh, a meeting will be deadened if the saints talk freely and express the self. Some brothers and sisters have no opportunity to speak in the big meetings and grasp the opportunity in the small group meeting to talk freely and express themselves. This causes others to lose interest. The saints come to the group meeting because they desire to obtain God&rsquo;s word. They are not interested in other things.</p>
<p>Eighth, a meeting will be deadened if the saints make extravagant food and strive to have the best love feast. In the small groups we are enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s word; we are not competing for the best snacks. Eating and drinking are not the purpose of the small group. If we always strive to make better snacks, we have confused the aim with the means. Snacks in the small groups should not be forbidden, but snacks are not our focus.</p>
<p>Ninth, a meeting will be deadened if the saints solicit business or borrow money in the small groups. We should never use the small groups to solicit business or to sell merchandise. The saints are not our customers. When such a situation arises, it must be stopped.</p>
<p>Tenth, a meeting will be deadened if there is no preaching of the gospel or no new ones in the small groups. This is a deadening factor to any small group. The absence of new ones in a small group violates the spirit of the small group and is also against the purpose of the small group. Even if the same saints attend the meeting every week, rain or shine, that group will decline if there are no new ones. The small group meetings are not only for us; they are to spread the gospel and uphold the saints.</p>
<p>If every small group can avoid these ten deadening factors and week by week focus on life, truth, and new ones, the small groups will surely be living and successful.</p>
