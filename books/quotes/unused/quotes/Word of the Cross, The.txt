When the Lord Jesus died for the sinners on the cross, He delivered man from the punishment of sin the eternal fire of hell
Because we have pride inside , as soon as outside temptation comes, the opportunity to be proud comes, and we become proud
Because we have jealousy inside, as soon as outside temptation comes, we see others better than we are, and we become jealous
He needs to punish sinners, yet He punished the Lord Jesus instead because the Lord Jesus stood in the position and on behalf of sinners
We know from Romans 66 that the result is that the body of sin is made of none effect and the goal is to make us no longer the slaves of sin
Now after the old man is dealt with by the Lord and is crucified, the body of sin becomes unemployed; there is no more work for it to do
When the old man was alive, it was the profession and the occupation of the body of sin to commit sins every day
What are the conditions that we need to fulfill before we can have the experience of dying together with the Lord?
Through faith, not works, one shares the result of the Lord Jesus' substitutional death, which is deliverance from eternal punishment
If you do not believe in Christ's death for you, you cannot partake of the effectiveness of this death deliverance from punishment
All those who believe in the substitutional death of Christ are saved, and all those who believe in their death with Christ have overcome
To share in the death of the Lord Jesus whether it be the substituting or the participating death requires faith
The more we sense the more we notice that our old man is not dead and the more we feel the more we see that our old man is still alive
Reckoning is an act of faith reckoning is the application of faith reckoning is the judgment of the will and the execution of the will
Whether the old man has died or not does not depend on your feeling; it depends on whether or not you have reckoned it
An act is a one time action toward a certain matter, while an attitude is a lasting evaluation toward something
We should have at least one time before God where, in a definite way, from that very day and hour, we reckon ourselves as dead
After that specific reckoning we should daily maintain this attitude of a definite reckoning an attitude that declares ourselves dead to sin
The failure of many people is this: they have reckoned themselves dead to sin and have received the word of dying with the Lord on the cross
They think that this matter is once for all and that once they have made such a reckoning, they will have no problem from then on
To take such an attitude is not a mental exercise of the mind, but a lasting evaluation of ourselves in our will
Whether or not you overcome depends on whether or not you have adopted the attitude of reckoning yourself dead
If the believers realize and receive the truth of the cross, there will not be so many backsliding and failing ones
A believer who wants to be delivered from sins must not make provisions for the flesh he must be watchful and must be ready to pay any price
Satan is very alert; he takes any opportunity to resurrect the old man and to cause the believers to commit sin
At such times, one should come back once again to the foundation of the cross and should once again reckon himself dead
He should wait for the Holy Spirit to apply to him the power of the cross, until the temptation loses its drawing power
Is it not true that sometimes we reckon over and over again and still we do not see any result, but instead we sin?
It is the judgment of your will to reckon yourself dead and to maintain this attitude of reckoning with a believing heart
At times if unfortunately we fail, we should rise up even more and should trust more in the power of the cross
They know very well how that after they sin, their regenerated life grieves over the evil and bitterness of sin
Anything they consider wrong they condemn as sin and regard such a thing as self and as the mother of sin and that it ought to be crucified
Sometimes when the self is expressed, it can appear very good in man's eyes and can appear very virtuous, very kind, and very righteous
They are so united that as soon as the 'mother' of sin moves, the self agrees and executes, and man commits the outward sins
Sin, being so powerful, affects the self, dominates the self, suppresses the self, and forces the self to come up with more ideas to sin
Even though sometimes the conscience makes a very faint protest, it is so short and weak that it disappears in no time
To them, self is just the many evils that appear in the fallen human life; it is just the root, the branches, and the leaves of sin
Those who have experienced Romans 6:11 will realize that though a man may have overcome sin, he may still not have overcome the self
To those believers who are advanced in life, victory over sin is easy, while victory over the self is very difficult
If a believer has the full experience of victory over the self, he will have attained the life that the apostles had
It was not spiritual because it was not transformed by the fruit of the tree of life; and it was not fleshly because it had not sinned
It belonged to itself, and as such it could sin if it wanted to sin, and it could be spiritual if it wanted to be spiritual
It is not spiritual because his spirit is still not free and it has not reached a walk according to God's higher life
It is not fleshly because the person has received the accomplishment of the cross and has reckoned himself dead to sin
On the one hand, they must protect themselves from falling; on the other hand, they must resolve to have some practical righteous works
Its intelligence causes him to come up with many wonderful Bible teachings and many methods for doing God's work
By realizing that all these gifts are from God, it is hoped that a man will turn completely away from himself to God
After a believer is brought by God to a deep realization of the evil of the self, he will be willing to put his self to death
We should tell God, 'Hereafter it is no longer I, no longer my own likeness, opinions, tastes, or preconceptions
No one can annihilate the few faculties which make up his being just by believing in his having been crucified with the Lord!
In order to maintain the work of this step, we must carry out the second step, which is to 'daily' take up the cross
Every moment, the self is looking for an opportunity to restore itself and will never let even the slightest chance pass by
The third step is to follow the Lord; this is to positively honor the Lord as Lord and to completely obey the Lord's will
We should allow the Holy Spirit to do His own work and should allow the accomplished work of the cross to be wrought into us
Unconsciously and unwittingly, one keeps the good part of the self and puts the evil part of the self to death
Subconsciously, they keep their honesty, patience, and love, and let the other wrong things be crucified with the Lord
they, being ignorant of God's righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, did not submit to the righteousness of God'
It must be separated from its companions and fall into the ground a dark, hidden, suffering place and die there
When the self dies, we will have to wait for the Lord's direction and leading, and will not dare to depend upon our own intelligence anymore
Even though at times we will lack the sense of the Lord, yet we will have to remain faithful, and we will not change our attitude
We should willingly put this life to death; we should have a full understanding of the poverty of this life and should hate it
