   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON EZEKIEL 18</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We will first begin from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider Ezekiel 18:24 and 26, which say, "But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die...When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These two verses can be considered as the main verses in the Old Testament concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No other verses in the Old Testament are as important as these.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are the most common and most frequently quoted verses.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, we have to devote some thoughtful consideration to these two verses.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ezekiel 18 never speaks of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It does not say anything about Jesus dying for man, nor does it say anything about believing in the Lord to receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not say how one takes care of the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It does not mention anything about the gospel or about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If one tries by force to apply this passage to the gospel, he is confusing the issue.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ezekiel 18 speaks of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What precedes this passage are things related to God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One must remember that things in God's government are totally different from things in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God's government refers to how God works, manages, and arranges things according to His plan and will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a man does not understand the difference between God's salvation and His government, and if he mixes the two together, he is mixing up God's law court with God's family, the father with the judge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is confusing the word spoken by the father to the servants with the word spoken to the sons.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is confusing the attitude a man has toward his employees with the attitude he has toward his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Government is government.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Government is not the same as salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The difference between government and salvation is as great as the distance between the north pole and the south pole.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ezekiel 18 does not show us salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Its subject is how the Israelites can live on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It does not speak of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It speaks of the problem with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not deal with the question of perdition for the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, it shows us that if a man does not keep the commandment of God, he will die early physically.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is a question of physical existence rather than spiritual salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No one can ever say that a son's teeth should be set on edge just because his father has eaten sour grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If someone sitting next to you eats sour grapes, you might feel like you can taste that same sourness in your own mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But if a father rebels against God's Word and sins, it has nothing to do with the son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the father has to die, the son cannot be a substitute for him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man sins, he himself should be cut off from God's promised land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This passage is absolutely on the death of the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what the end of verse 2 tells us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then, after these words, from verse 3, chapter eighteen repeats that those who sin shall die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rather, it is what Adam experienced, the death of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a man sins, his days on earth shall be shortened by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From verse 3, this chapter repeatedly tells us who can live on earth through the blessing of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the context of the words preceding verse 24.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If a righteous man who was righteous has now turned evil, he will die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All his former righteousnesses shall not be remembered.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This has absolutely nothing to do with salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a matter of God's government.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It tells us why God would not let a man live on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It explains why many people die early.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a word concerning the judgment of sin for the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE ARGUMENT BASED ON MATTHEW 24</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now let us take a look at the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matthew 24:13 says, "But he who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When many see this verse, they jump up in surprise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They think that this verse is surely about salvation and not about God's government, as we have just claimed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, some would say that since I lost my temper yesterday and did not endure, I am now unsaved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They would say that it is true that a person must believe in the Lord Jesus in order to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But they would also say that a person must endure as well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if you say this, you are twisting the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>You have cut off the head and the tail in God's Word and have taken a sentence out of context.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>No wonder we confuse the Word of God!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you would understand the meaning of endurance spoken of in this verse, you have to know what was spoken of before verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You must also know what was spoken after verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 13 is not speaking about the Christians at all.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is speaking about the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>What evidence do we have?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>First, in the following passage we have the Holy Place, the holy temple, and the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All these are Judaic matters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What these verses say is that the Jews should flee to the countryside and should pray that their fleeing would not be in winter or on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When they see the abomination of desolation, that is, the image of the beast in the Holy Place, they have to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They should not stay in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If this word is for us, how can we possibly know these things, seeing that we are in Shanghai and the image of the beast is to appear in the temple?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Although we do have wireless communication today, what Matthew is speaking about here is a knowledge that comes after actually having seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only one who is as near as those in Jerusalem can see.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Hence, this passage refers only to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Second, the time in this verse does not refer to the time of the apostles, nor does it refer to the time of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The time spoken of here refers to the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It refers to the last three and a half years at the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At the beginning of the tribulation, Antichrist will set up his image in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This passage of Scripture has nothing to do with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It refers to the future, not to today.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is no possibility for this to happen today, because Antichrist has not yet come, his image has not yet been set up in the temple, and the great tribulation has not yet started.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Matthew 24 refers to the time of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The salvation mentioned here does not refer to the salvation of the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Rather, it refers to the salvation of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>All the things mentioned here have to do with the salvation of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All those who understand the Bible know that this is the period of time when Antichrist will set up his image in the temple, forcing men to worship it and putting his seal upon people's foreheads.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When all the Jews who worship and serve God see the beginning of the tribulation, they must not worship in that way and must not receive the seal.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Because of this, they will suffer much.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Many persecutions will come upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>That is why the Lord Jesus told the Jews to flee when they see the image of Antichrist in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If anyone has things at home, they should not bother to get them.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They should hide themselves quickly in safe places.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Furthermore, the Lord told them to pray that their flight would not be on a Sabbath v. 20 . The reason for this is that they keep the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The women should not be pregnant at that time because it would be hard for them to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Woe will be to those who are nursing babies at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It would also be better if they did not face winter at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They should flee to the mountains or to the countryside with the hope that by chance they would not see suffering, persecution, and affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>At that time, all the forces of Rome will come upon them like a net.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>They will suffer many difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Many verses in Revelation show us this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>These people will be saved if they endure during this great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Because we are too concerned for the matter of salvation, every time the word save appears, we apply it to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>But one cannot apply this word to himself here.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If he does, he will be twisting the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In verse 22 the Lord Jesus said another word: "And unless those days had been cut short, no flesh would be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When Antichrist is on earth, no one will be able to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Thank the Lord that his day will not be that long.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Because of this, there will still be some who can flee.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If one endures, he can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Hence, the question of salvation here is not a question of eternal life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The nature of the salvation mentioned here has to do with falling into the hands of Antichrist or not.</S>
