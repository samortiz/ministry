[1]  If he views his faith in the Lord Jesus as being a favor to the Lord and his faith in God as a courtesy to Him, it will be impossible to talk to him about consecration.
[2]  We are no longer our own; we are the Lord's. We must glorify God in our bodies because we are not our own; we have been bought by the Lord with a price.
[3]  We must realize that our service to God is not a favor or courtesy to God.
[4]  It is not a matter of offering ourselves to God's work, but a matter of God being gracious to us and giving us a portion of His work.
[5]  Consecration is God giving us glory and beauty; it is God calling us into His service.
[6]  We are not uplifting God, as if we were sacrificing anything for Him or as if we had any glory in ourselves.
[7]  But before God we must see that our entire life is directed towards our service to God.
