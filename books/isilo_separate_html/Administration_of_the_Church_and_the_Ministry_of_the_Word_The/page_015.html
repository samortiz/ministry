AND DAMAGING THE AUTHORITY IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>We need to search our heart and consider whether our work during the past six months has brought us into one accord or into dissension. To be in one accord is to be building up; to be in dissension is to be tearing down. The responsible brothers are in dissension if they change the intention of the elders without the feeling of tearing down. If seven of the twenty-eight home group meetings are in this condition, the church in Taipei will be in discord and scattered.</p>
<p>We are not here to establish the authority of the elders as if they were popes, but we need to ask whether there is an administrative authority in the local church. In whose hands should this authority be? If this authority is in the hands of the one thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly, we will become the church in Laodicea (cf. Rev. 3:14-22). If this authority is in the hands of a pope, we will become the Roman Catholic Church. The administration of a local church is in the hands of the elders. The elders should learn to submit themselves to God and fear Him. They should administrate the church in fear and trembling and learn to be strong. They should be afraid of making mistakes and of being weak and indecisive. If a group meeting should be stopped, the elders should make the decision without hesitation; otherwise, the remaining home meetings will become like small local churches.</p>
<p>If no one in a local church has been broken, fears God, or acknowledges the authority in the church in his service, that local church is in discord. Their many activities will result in more tearing down. It would almost be better to have fewer activities. If any of the responsible brothers in the church in Taipei have an opinion that differs from the decision of the elders, there will be a tearing down work in the church. Such a situation of dissension will cause death. If the responsible ones in the homes are like this, those in the groups will also voice their opposing opinions. This kind of trend can be likened to the body contracting an infection, which will kill the body. This is dissension and tearing down.</p>
<p>Through the subtle scheme of Satan, our labor may in fact be a tearing down work. Some brothers and sisters have made a great sacrifice for the Lord and for the church. On the one hand, we should not boast of the sacrifice we have made, but on the other hand, since we have made such a sacrifice, we should not allow Satan&rsquo;s scheme to enter into our midst. If we serve in discord, we will have no way to continue. Satan&rsquo;s most cunning scheme is to do a dissenting and scattering work in our midst.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s work is not to cause everyone to argue; rather, it is to do a work of tearing down through man&rsquo;s good desire and intention. This is his craftiness. Apparently, the suggestion of the responsible brother to study a different book of the Bible is for the benefit of the saints, but in fact, it is not. However, if we have truly learned the lesson, we will see that although the arrangement in the church service should be flexible, not rigid, there must be one accord and one move in the church. In this way the church will avoid falling into Satan&rsquo;s schemes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>Every local church must honor the authority of the Holy Spirit, whether it is large or small. For example, although thousands among the Jews had believed in the church in Jerusalem (Acts 21:20), there was not a conference of the church for the people to vote on different matters in chapter 15. Instead, the apostles and elders gathered together before God, and after some shared their experience and light, James stood up and spoke (vv. 6, 22, 13). This is the authority of the Holy Spirit in the Bible.</p>
<p>After meeting together, they wrote a letter to the Gentile believers (v. 20). They did not quarrel, nor did the church hold a conference for the believers to express their opinion through a vote; instead, the apostles and elders gathered together before God to decide the matter. Once they made a decision concerning the problem of circumcision, no further opinion was expressed.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
