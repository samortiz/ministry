   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. David Repenting and Being Forgiven by God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Jehovah reproved him through the prophet Nathan 2 Sam 12:1-12 , David repented and was forgiven by God 2 Sam 12:13; Psa 51:1-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>D. The Five Psalms Being Composed</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>according to David's Concepts of a Godly Life 1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Asking God to Deal with His Adversaries</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>and Be a Shield around Him, His Glory</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>and the One Who Lifted Up His Head</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalms 3 7 were composed according to David's concepts of a godly life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In these psalms David asked God to deal with his adversaries and be a shield around him, his glory and the One who lifted up his head Psa 3:1-3, 6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Does asking God to deal with his adversaries correspond with the New Testament teaching?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely, it is against the New Testament teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The New Testament teaches us to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us Matt 5:44; Luke 6:27, 35; Rom 12:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I have been in the Lord's recovery for sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In these sixty years, I have encountered opposition and even rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How do we react to such opposition?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As descendants of Adam, we would ask the Lord to deal with all these opposers for us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if we are in the reality of the New Testament, we dare not pray this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot pray this way to the Lord because He told us to love our enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>David also asked the Lord to be a shield of protection around him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is this good or bad?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is wrong with asking God to protect us?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would say that this is neither bad nor good.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that juncture when he was fleeing from his son, David prayed such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Why did he not pray, "Lord, You know I committed that sin which caused my son to be rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, don't condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Lord, condemn me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I repent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I would like to have a time to say to my son, 'Son, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The cause of today's trouble is not you, but me.'</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Lord, deal with my heart."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is a spiritual prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead, David was asking the Lord to be a shield around him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a murderer and a fornicator, was David worthy to be protected?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He also asked God to be his glory and the One who lifted up his head.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Should David not have felt ashamed to ask this of God when he was fleeing from his son, being chastised by God because of his murder and fornication?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Calling Out to Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>and Believing That He Would Answer Him</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>from His Holy Mountain</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>David also called out to Jehovah and believed that He would answer him from His holy mountain Psa 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Praying in the Night for Jehovah's Sustaining</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>David was also praying in the night for Jehovah's sustaining Psa 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Nearly all the Bible students and teachers call Psalm 3 a psalm of night prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is praying nightly good or bad?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It all depends upon how we pray.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If David were really in the spirit, he would have considered the situation he was in at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was fleeing from his rebellious son.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He should have considered what caused his son to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then he would pray at night, "God, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was I who caused my son to rebel.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It was I who murdered Uriah, using my power and position as king to carry out conspiracy and murder.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What a shame that even I robbed Uriah of his wife."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As he was fleeing from his son, David should have felt shameful and repentant before God.</S>
