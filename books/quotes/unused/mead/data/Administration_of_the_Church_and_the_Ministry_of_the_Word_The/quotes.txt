[1]  The Administration of the Church and the Ministry of the Word CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; Eph 4:11, 16; 2:20; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Cor 3:9-10, 14; 14:4-5, 12, 26; Heb 11:10 GOD S INTENTION BEING TO RECOVER
[3]  In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the building up of the church.
[4]  May the Lord grant those of us who serve together a deep feeling that He needs a strong recovery.
[5]  The church is the temple of God, the house of God, but in the New Jerusalem we will not see a temple v. 22 , because the temple will be enlarged into a city.
[6]  The building is not a matter of understanding doctrines, saving sinners, or even edifying the saints.
[7]  Even though the New Testament refers to the edification of individual saints, its focus is on the building of God s house.
[8]  We often have strong feelings concerning saving sinners and edifying the saints, but we lack feeling concerning building God s house.
[9]  This does not mean that we should not pay attention to saving sinners and edifying the saints, but we need to see the ultimate goal of God s work in this age.
[10]  For example, our shortage in building God s house is the basic reason the brothers and sisters in Taipei do not seem to have the strength to preach the gospel.
[11]  The two most important matters in the building up of the church, God s house, are the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.
[12]  We might not all be able to speak and fulfill the ministry of the word as prophets, nor can all of us administrate the church as elders.
[13]  In principle, those who have a part in God s work should learn to administrate the church and minister the word.
[14]  If we do not know these two matters, we are unskilled in God s work.
[15]  The condition of God s building, that is, whether a local church is strong or weak, depends on the administration carried out by the elders and the word released by the ministry.
[16]  Whenever the skilled workers are weak, the administration of the church and the ministry of the word are weak in that church, and the workers who are not as skilled will be confused and not know what to do.
[17]  God wants to take the way of building, but the problem He encounters is our person.
[18]  For the sake of God s building and the future of the work, may the Lord have mercy on us so that we would see that the problem is not with our doctrine or practice but with our person.
[19]  May we all have a heart that fears the Lord to see that the building up of the church depends on the person of those who administrate the church and those who minister the word.
[20]  The greatest problem in the administration of the church and the ministry of the word is not having a burden or, we can say, not receiving a burden or not paying attention to a burden.
[21]  If some are not yet saved, we should receive a burden to bear their souls by the Lord s grace to sow the seed of salvation into them when we release the word.
[22]  In Isaiah 13:1 the Chinese Union Version says that the prophets received inspiration when they spoke for God.
[23]  When we minister the word of God, our concern should be whether we have God s speaking, not the topic of our speaking.
[24]  A message that sounds nice but is void of God s speaking cannot touch people, turn them inwardly, or satisfy those who are hungry and thirsty, because they are not the words that God wants to speak even if they are from the Bible.
[25]  We have a good order in our service, but we are lacking in burden.
[26]  Having a burden means that we have a goal which we must reach.
[27]  If we have not reached our goal or are unable to produce the expected result, we should be concerned.
[28]  If we are able to serve, even though there is no result, we do not have a burden.
[29]  Hence, the brothers who minister the word must bear a heavy burden before the Lord, having no peace to rest or eat and even troubling others so that they also have no peace.
[30]  Everyone who serves the Lord must receive a burden and have a burden.
[31]  This also applies to the sisters even though they are not involved in the church administration or in giving messages.
[32]  They should not say, As long as the Lord works in them, they will be all right, but if the Lord does not work in them, there is nothing we can do.
[33]  Those who live in the workers home are bright and capable.
[34]  They seem to be independent and do not need others.
[35]  Not Requiring Others to Be the Same as We,
[36]  We should not require others to be the same as we are in everything.
[37]  Even if we are not pleased with the way others live, we cannot set standards for others, nor are we qualified to judge others.
[38]  When we speak of being zealous, we should respect others quietness; when we speak of being calm and joined to the Lord, we should not criticize those who are busy.
[39]  The brothers need to learn the lesson of being broken, accommodating others, and respecting others function.
[40]  Thus, we must be faithful to what the Lord has entrusted us with and learn to work in coordination with others, respecting what they do.
[41]  IN THE CHURCH SERVICE OUR SERVICE NEEDING TO PRODUCE THE BUILDING
[42]  Our administration of the church might not result in much building up of the church.
[43]  Even our bringing people to salvation and helping the saints to be edified might not result in much building up of the church.
[44]  For example, when some preach the gospel, they not only save sinners but also build up the church; when they edify the saints, they not only help the saints but also build up the church.
[45]  We need to search our heart and consider whether our work during the past six months has brought us into one accord or into dissension.
[46]  We are not here to establish the authority of the elders as if they were popes, but we need to ask whether there is an administrative authority in the local church.
[47]  On the one hand, we should not boast of the sacrifice we have made, but on the other hand, since we have made such a sacrifice, we should not allow Satan s scheme to enter into our midst.
[48]  However, if we have truly learned the lesson, we will see that although the arrangement in the church service should be flexible, not rigid, there must be one accord and one move in the church.
[49]  Those who have learned the lesson will say Amen when the elders decide that the group meetings should study the Gospel of John.
[50]  Those who feel that this book is too long should be helped by those who have learned this lesson to submit to the church and respect the authority of the church.
[51]  A person who argues about which book the church should study and doubts the decision of the elders does not have a submissive spirit or attitude.
[52]  If we have learned the lesson, are broken, and know God s building, those whom we lead will be living stones being built up as a spiritual house.
[53]  John 14 seems easy to read, and there have been many expositions of this chapter in the Bible, but this chapter is difficult to understand.
[54]  By the Lord s leading and our experience, we are beginning to understand the true meaning of this chapter.
[55]  The Brethren consider the Lord s word in verse 3, a word spoken to His disciples before His departure from the world, to be a word of prophecy.
[56]  They understand this verse to mean that the Lord Jesus was going to heaven in order to prepare a place for us and that once this place was prepared, He would come and take us to heaven so that we would be with Him.
[57]  The central thought of John 14 is, Believe into God, believe also into Me. As those who believe in the Lord Jesus, we need to believe into God and believe into the Lord.
[58]  Protestantism has adopted the thought of Catholicism and frequently speaks about going to heaven.
[59]  Actually, we are in heaven; we have been seated with Christ in the heavenlies since the day we were saved because the day we believed into Christ, we entered into God.
[60]  God s entering into man is His coming to the earth; man s entering into God is man s going to heaven.
[61]  The disciples thought the Lord was referring to a place and replied, We do not know where You are going; how can we know the way? v. 5 . Then the Lord Jesus said to them, I am the way...; no one comes to the Father except through Me v. 6 . The way is the Lord Himself, and the destination is the Father.
[62]  If the Lord Jesus is God s house, how can He go to prepare a place for us?
[63]  Ephesians 2:21-22 says that we are growing into a holy temple in the Lord, into a dwelling place of God in spirit.
[64]  We should not think that after God has saved all of us sinners and has finished building mansions for us in heaven, He will come and take us to live in these mansions.
[65]  In this work sinners are saved to become building materials that are then mingled with God.
[66]  CHAPTER FIVE THE ONENESS IN JOHN 17 Scripture Reading: John 17 THE PROCESS OF THE ONENESS
[67]  John 17 is the Lord s prayer in which He asked the Father to fulfill all that was spoken in chapters 14 through 16.
[68]  In chapter 14 the Lord spoke of the coming Comforter; in chapter 15 He spoke of the vine, showing that our relationship with Him is like the union of a vine and its branches; and in chapter 16 He said that the unique factor in this union is the Holy Spirit.
[69]  The Holy Spirit comes not only to convict us that we may have a union with the Lord in love but also to transmit all that the Father and the Son have into us.
[70]  After speaking the things in chapters 14 through 16, the Lord prayed to the Father: Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You v. 1 . The Lord prophesied that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him 12:23; 13:31-32 . In 12:24 the Lord said that He would die as a grain of wheat in order that the shell of His humanity could be broken and the divine life within Him would be released and dispensed into many people and expressed through them.
[71]  God s blessing to the church is in the oneness.
[72]  The Holy Spirit moves in the oneness, the power of the gospel is in the oneness, the authority of God is in the oneness, the light of God is in the oneness, and the supply of the divine life is also in the oneness.
[73]  We do not abound in God s blessing, and His presence is not evident among us, because there is not enough building among us.
[74]  Even if we have God s blessing, and our work helps others to learn in life, receive spiritual edification, and love the Lord, we will not be able to carry out an eternal work.
[75]  If we have only edification but have not allowed God to do a building work in us, we may administrate the church as elders, but our administration will lack the element of building.
[76]  The brothers should cooperate with God to speak for God for the purpose of building, not for tearing down.
[77]  If we learn this lesson before God, our serving as elders will result in the building up of the church, and our cleaning the meeting hall will also result in the building up of the church.
[78]  John 13:34-35 says, A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.
[79]  The words know that you are My disciples can also be rendered know that you are those who follow Me. John 17:21 says, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. Verse 23 says, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. When people in the world see the oneness of the serving ones, they can believe that the Lord was sent by God, that He is the Christ of God.
[80]  The characteristic of loving one another, the harmony in love, causes people not only to know that we are the Lord s followers but also to believe that the Lord is the Christ.
[81]  It is also crucial that we learn to know people as we administrate the church and minister the word.
[82]  We need to know people for the administration of the church, and we also need to know people for the ministry of the word.
[83]  If we do not know people, we cannot build up the church; rather, the church will be brought into confusion and torn down.
[84]  If our intentions, motives, and purposes have been thoroughly dealt with by the Lord, when we touch others, we will know their intentions, motives, and thoughts, and we will immediately know the source of their problems.
[85]  If our judgment concerning people is inaccurate, our administration of the church will result in tearing down.
[86]  A lack of knowledge concerning people will only cause the church to suffer loss even though we have no intention to tear down the church.
[87]  If we want to know people, we must learn to discern whether their motives and intentions are pure before God.
[88]  If our motives have never been dealt with by the Lord, we should not think that we can know the motives of others.
[89]  To discern a person s spiritual level is to know whether or not his spiritual condition is rich, strong, high, and pure.
[90]  For example, there are some brothers whose heart is pure and whose flesh has been dealt with, but because their spirit is very weak and cannot rise up, they cannot do anything.
[91]  Concerning our knowing of people, we need to know man s motives, flesh, and spirit.
[92]  Some Western missionaries once confronted me, saying that the brothers who are responsible for the group meetings should take proper care of their own households and not be in so many meetings.
[93]  Although these brothers had a good intention, we should ask, Whose house is more important, God s house or ours?
[94]  The way of consecration is a way of suffering, a way of sacrifice, in which everything that pertains to us is wrecked.
[95]  In this chapter we will consider different matters that we should know.
[96]  For the building up of the church, we must know people and different matters.
[97]  If we simply want to be zealous ones who preach the gospel to save sinners and speak the truth to perfect the saints, there is no need for us to have a knowledge concerning various matters.
[98]  Two Western brothers, one of whom was a doctor, were among us for a period of time, but their work was not very profitable.
[99]  They had a desire to serve with the saints, but we felt that they did not obtain much profit; neither did they render much profit to the brothers and sisters.
[100]  The lack of profit was not related to edification but to the building up of the church.
[101]  In relation to the building up of the church, we felt that receiving them into the service would result in a great loss.
[102]  As those who serve the Lord, we should not gossip or be careless in our conversations about this matter.
[103]  The past one hundred years of Christian work here has not built up the church; instead, it has damaged and torn down the church.
[104]  In our contact with people we must discern matters.
[105]  Although we cannot interfere in the matters that do not involve us, we should not neglect the matters that involve us.
[106]  The building up of the church does not depend on our acknowledgment of Western things as good.
[107]  Most people think that building enables us to coordinate together so that we are no longer separate individuals but a corporate Body.
[108]  In Ephesians 4:11-12 Paul says that God gave various gifts to the church for the building up of the Body of Christ, the building up of the church.
[109]  To build the church, the Body of Christ, is a general expression in the Bible.
[110]  To build the temple is to build God s habitation that God may have the ground in man, dwell in man, and mingle Himself with man.
[111]  In other words, when we have been inwardly built by God and thus have His presence, we will be joined with those who have also been built by God and thus have His presence to become His temple.
[112]  Our work is to let people know what it means to have the mingling of God and man and what it means to be under God s authority.
[113]  In other words, if we know God s presence without knowing His authority, we do not have the city and the temple.
[114]  The Old Testament says that the city of David was David s stronghold 1 Chron 11:5, 7 .
[115]  Therefore, when Nehemiah went forth to recover the city, the enemies appeared Neh 4:7-8 , and those who built the wall did the work with one hand and held a weapon with the other v. 17 . This type is clear.
[116]  It means that those who build the church must build and fight at the same time.
[117]  When we lead the brothers and sisters to love the Lord and live for Him, thereby enabling them to obtain God s presence, we will not encounter much warfare.
[118]  However, as we lead the church to have a proper order and enter into God s authority, the enemy will come.
[119]  The church should function in this way, and the administration of any country should also function in this way.
[120]  Hence, as we select material for the ministry of the word, on the one hand, we should check and see if the lessons we have learned and the burden we have received are our basis, and on the other hand, we should watch over our heart so that we are not proud.
[121]  In our preparation to minister the word, we must look for material that is living, not dead.
[122]  If those who minister the word desire to be different from others, they will be tempted to select material that is new and unusual but also dead.
[123]  If we speak from the Bible, we will not have many problems, but if we expound the Bible, we will have many problems, because speaking from the Bible is different from expounding the Bible.
[124]  The basis and principle for selecting material are to supply people with life, to solve their problems, and to generate a feeling of need within them.
[125]  In the same principle, when we give a message, we should avoid speaking in a scientific way.
[126]  For example, we have failed if we teach people only according to the main headings and subheadings of an outline.
[127]  Even though it is not bad to read an outline, it is more important to learn to touch people s feeling.
[128]  We must fellowship, through prayer and consideration, with those whom we serve concerning the content of our speaking.
[129]  Some localities are doing well related to the administration of the church and the ministry of the word.
[130]  In the Bible-reading meeting, it is best to read one chapter a week.
[131]  There is another need that we have not taken care of in the past.
[132]  We should grasp the opportunity in every meeting of mutuality to supply others with the word.
[133]  I then spoke for fifteen minutes concerning the Lord s name, showing the brothers and sisters that we are saved in this name, we have been placed into this name, we pray in this name, and we overcome Satan by this name.
[134]  For this reason, those who administrate the church and minister the word cannot be simple persons.
[135]  Furthermore, we should lead the saints to take part in the activities in the meetings.
[136]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE WORD BEING TO SUPPLY AND ADMINISTRATION BEING FOR BUILDING UP CARING FOR PRACTICAL NEEDS
[137]  In the previous chapter we considered our need to study how to use the ministry of the word to uplift the meetings of the church.
[138]  We should believe that among the ministers raised up by God in the church, some will function to supply the church with fresh and original things, and others will not.
[139]  THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD HAVING A MAIN POINT
[140]  We must seek to have a word for these responsible brothers, and we must seek to have a word to supply all the needs of the saints.
[141]  Although the speaking in a local church may have Christ, the Son of God, the cross, and the dealing with the flesh as the focus, there is also the need for speaking concerning other aspects.
[142]  Those who release the word must learn to pay attention also to their manner of speaking.
[143]  Of course, we do not pay attention to outward things, but the way we speak can greatly affect the release of the word.
[144]  In the administration of the church, there is one matter that has been neglected by all the churches.
[145]  If this is the case, we can serve as elders or in the ministry of the word, but our administration of the church and our ministering of the word can only cause the saints to love the Lord zealously and be individually spiritual.
[146]  But we cannot say that the believers in Catholicism can satisfy God s heart s desire and need in this age.
[147]  In the same principle, we can save many people and perfect them to become spiritual, but this cannot satisfy the desire of God s heart.
[148]  Since we are attending to the Lord s work, in everything we do, whether in the administration of the church, the ministry of the word, or visiting the saints, we should hold on to the principle that our work should result in the building up of the believers.
[149]  In order for the Lord to advance in these last days, we cannot merely speak about the ground of the church.
[150]  If we desire to have the building, we must be sure to have the proper ground.
[151]  On the one hand, we need to see the building up of the church, and on the other hand, we need to see the main frustration to the building not having the proper ground of the church.
[152]  When the saints in Jerusalem were built together, they became the church in Jerusalem.
[153]  May the Lord cover me with His blood to say this: the work of Brother Austin-Sparks at Honor Oak is quite spiritual, but because he neglects the ground of the church, his work has no future.
[154]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH GROUND THE BEGINNING OF THE LORD S RECOVERY
[155]  In this chapter we will speak concerning the type of testimony the Lord wants us to bear in this age.
[156]  Regardless of how much we speak, however, we need a vision and revelation concerning these things so that we may have a genuine seeing.
[157]  In the beginning of the work in the East, God gave us the feeling that the condition of Christianity was not proper.
[158]  Even though we were clear that the church is one and should not be divided into sects and we knew the meaning of sectarianism, it was not until 1934 that the light concerning the expression of the church in a locality was clearly and accurately released to all the saints among us.
[159]  After his study, he saw clearly from the Word of God that there is only one church in the universe, but when the church is expressed, it is expressed locality by locality; in other words, there is only one expression of the church in every locality.
[160]  The letter I wrote to Brother Hsieh Tien En was my first article published by Brother Nee s Gospel Book Room.
[161]  We saw that Christ as God s centrality and universality is the content of the church and that outwardly the church should take the ground of locality.
[162]  At the beginning of 1935 a few co-workers felt that the trend of leaving the denominations was not correct, because it involved many complicated issues.
[163]  He said that leaving the denominations is not our testimony; rather, our testimony is Christ: Christ as the Savior, Christ as life, Christ as the conquering King, Christ as the Lord of all things, Christ as God s centrality, and Christ as God s universality.
[164]  He also pointed out that the testimony of Christ is absolutely in the church and that the church is one and the ground of the church is local.
[165]  We studied how to deal with the difficulties brought to us by those who were powerful in the gospel and were spiritual but who did not bear this testimony.
[166]  We sought the Lord, asking what type of attitude we should have toward them.
[167]  Based on our feeling and our past experiences, we decided that we must keep the testimony that we saw in the beginning, the testimony of one local church in one locality and that we must build all spiritual things on this ground.
[168]  Our relationship with Brother Austin-Sparks was not based on the ground of the church; rather, it was based on spiritual matters.
[169]  We were clear concerning the Lord s desire for us in the East; we also felt that we should receive a supply from other ministries.
[170]  For this reason, Brother Nee said that Brother Austin-Sparks was not as clear as we were related to the ground of the church, and we did not ask Brother Austin-Sparks his position concerning the ground.
[171]  Since we have seen the ground, we must keep it steadfastly.
[172]  If the ground of denomination is right, we should not have another ground; we should all worship God in the denominations.
[173]  Brother Austin-Sparks did not know this when he came to Taiwan.
[174]  It is a problem that the brothers from the West have an attitude of superiority.
[175]  However, we should not oppose them because of this, nor should we react negatively or look down on them.
[176]  We should be clear concerning what the Lord has given to the church over the past two thousand years, and we should understand the significance of the Lord s raising us up in the East in this age.
