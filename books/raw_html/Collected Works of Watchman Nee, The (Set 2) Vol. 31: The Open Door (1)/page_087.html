<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF A FEW BROTHERS AND SISTERS</h2><p>Mrs. Han Fu-sheng is safe in her ancestral home in Wu-Jen, Kiangsu.</p><p>Brother Chang Hao-ran has arrived in Shanghai and will be teaching in a school.</p><p>Sister Hsiao Yu-yin, Sister Chang Yi-hwa, and Brother Chang Ho-nien are all in Shih-Lu-Tou Ch'en Po Du, Ning-Po.</p><p>(The above are excerpts from Brother Ho Yueh-chiao's letter of January 26&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>Brother Chu En-sheng passed through Shanghai. All the brothers and sisters are hiding out in the countryside around Chi-Hsien-Chiao. His store was robbed. Brother Chou Jin-tang has already come to Shanghai.</p><p>(The above is an excerpt from Brother Ho Yueh-chiao's letter of February 19&mdash;Editor.)</p><p>"We received a letter from Tang Shou-ling last night and a letter from Brother Chou Hsing-yih this morning. We found out they are both living in Mo-Gan-Shan (250 Mo-Gan-Shan). The Sun family, the Yeh family, and the Yu family are all staying with them. The letter was given to friends and carried to us. It was very simple. They said, `Our homes are gone, but we are alive,' and, `May the Lord open the way.' The letter was dated January 30, but we did not receive it until yesterday, so we do not know how they are doing now. We cannot send mail or wire money to them. We can only pray for them on the one hand, and ask some of our Western friends to see whether they can go to Mo-Gan-Shan and bring them out on the other hand."</p><p>(The above is an excerpt of a letter from the three elders in Shanghai, Du Chung-chen, Wu You-an, and Lin Kwang-biao&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head1">ANNOUNCEMENTS</h2><p>(1) The meeting place of the church in Fu-Ching moved from Luke Hospital back to 65 Siao-Chiao Street, Fu-Ching on February 18. From now on, please send all publications to that address.</p><p>(2) Brother Chou Cheng-wen has moved from Anhwei to Szechuan. His mailing address is c/o Sheng Shien-tze, Jen-Ji Men's Hospital, Sheng-Chi, Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan.</p><p>(3) Brother and Sister Pan Hwei-sheng have arrived safely in Hankow from He-Fei. On the twentieth of this month, they will go south to Hong Kong and from there to Amoy.</p><h2 class="head1">A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</h2><p>The fourth issue of this publication was a half month late in coming out because the typesetting and printing workers took a vacation for the Chinese New Year. Beginning with the sixth issue, we hope that our paper will come out by the middle of each month.</p><p>Presently, this publication cannot publish articles concerning the principles of the work. Those who do not care for the news of work and the churches will find it boring. However, if we can take Christ's heart as our own, we will thank God and also pray much for the work and the brothers and sisters after reading this publication. I hope and pray to God that He would raise up many people who will pray powerfully in secret behind the work. They must be powerful before God in order to break down Satan's strongholds, overthrow every high thing that frustrates people from knowing God, and capture people's hearts so that they would all submit to Christ.</p><p>Some brothers have written letters saying that using the letter X to replace names and places is not so appropriate, so beginning with this issue, we will use the X less. Sometimes we will use the X to replace a person's name or a number so that we can avoid having man as our center and also avoid giving glory to man's will. Many brothers and sisters correspond with others with the intention of spiritual fellowship and the discussion of spiritual matters. However, we are afraid some people might gradually misunderstand and think that certain people have a special position or are higher than others, so we use X to replace the names of the people who receive the letters because love covers all things (it does not expose people's private matters). The writers of the letters have never had their names replaced with X because they are responsible for what they wrote. We thank God that all the localities and some individuals are mindful of the needs of the work and the saints, and we hope that all the saints would thank God for this. But we do not want a printed number to cause some to boast or to reveal who is rich and who is poor, thus turning the offerings into something that is not out of love or the leading of God. For this reason, we use X to replace any amount of money. The example given to us by the New Testament churches is also this way. According to Acts 4:37, Barnabas "possessed a field, sold it and brought the sum of money and placed it at the feet of the apostles." Second Corinthians 8:2 says that the churches in Macedonia in "the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality." Philippians 4:16 says, "You sent both once and again to my need." The brothers who brought this to mind did not mention this matter, but I am just taking this opportunity to give an explanation. (Of course, those who send money had to write the amount or they would be unable to wire the money.)</p><p>When more than one letter comes from one locality with the same news, we often publish only one of them. We do not publish letters that are not very important. We may delete some portions of your writing. There are also some letters which are good, but the editors do not feel inwardly peaceful about them and decide not to print them. Perhaps this is prejudice, screening, or an inward hindrance. We dare not say what it is, but we can only do what keeps our hearts at peace. We ask your special forgiveness for this. May God give grace that this kind of deletion would not hurt, offend, or bury anyone.</p><p>Before putting out this publication, I seemed to have two concerns: (1) Some people are still not clear about the Lord's calling, and others cannot give a testimony for them, but they consider themselves apostles after they have done a little work. Those who do not know these ones may see them as apostles; this will not edify people and is not beneficial to the entire church. (2) Some people are used by the Lord, but because their flesh has not been dealt with, they have too much fleshly activity. Mr. Nee has now given us the light concerning the local churches. A local church can prove those who call themselves apostles but are not. Thus, my first concern is no longer a problem. With regard to my second concern, I hope that the co-workers in every place and in all the local churches will do their best to send news to us for the sake of God's glory, mutual fellowship, and prayer. I also hope that the motive behind every letter is pure and that the reports are not exaggerated. Some apostles can be like Paul and do not need the recommendation of men. However, some apostles still need to be tested. They need the introduction of the co-workers who are ahead of them. Therefore, we ask the faithful co-workers to help us in both the positive and negative aspects of this matter so that we may publish the news with care.</p><p>Recently a co-worker (brother) sent a letter saying that one locality only knows that we preach baptism and leaving the denominations. They did not seem to have heard any of the other truths. I do not know whether someone has really preached this way or whether this is the misunderstanding of some dissatisfied ones. However, we must be careful, so I will quote some of Mr. Nee's words from the first issue, "Finally, a word of reminder: Our urgent need is the preaching of the gospel and the establishing of the local churches. We are not here to exhort others to leave the denominations. Those who pay attention only to the question of denominationalism...are not our co-workers and are not qualified to be our co-workers."</p><p>It is very difficult to mail letters. Some places have not even received the second issue. Beginning with the third issue, we have been using the quickest method to send one or two copies to each locality. We send the rest by surface mail. Therefore, we hope that when the churches in each locality receive this publication, they would immediately report the important points of all the news to the brothers and sisters so that they will not worry and will know what to pray for.</p><p>If there is any news that cannot be made public, please note it in your letters. If any letter must be given directly to Mr. Nee, please state this in the letter. Many letters come to Hankow addressed to Mr. Nee, but they contain news of the work or the churches. Some of the news has a time limit, but Mr. Nee travels constantly because of the work and is planning to go abroad; if we do not need to forward it to him, we can just publish it in this publication. (If letters for Mr. Nee are sent to the P. O. Box in Hankow, we ask Brother Lan to open and read them and then give them to the editors of this publication. This is the agreement we made with Mr. Nee.)</p><p>Finally, a brother in Hankow who proofreads sent us a letter saying that there were still many mistakes after the second proofing of the fourth issue, but that the printer had printed it before it could be proofed a third time. There were many mistakes in the fourth issue in both words and punctuation. We want to apologize to our readers for these mistakes!</p><p>Ruth Lee<br />March 5, 1938, in Chungking</p>
