   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>38 March 1, 1951 THE OLD RUGGED CROSS On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The emblem of suff'ring and shame,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For a world of lost sinners was slain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Till my trophies at last I lay down;</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will cling to the old rugged cross,</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And exchange it some day for a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Has a wondrous attraction for me;</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To bear it to dark Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A wondrous beauty I see;</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To pardon and sanctify me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>translated into Chinese by Watchman Nee EXPECTING THE LORD'S BLESSING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A Record of a Fellowship Meeting with the Co-workers</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Of late a thought has been constantly with me that all the work is dependent on God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Often we are faithful, but despite our faithfulness there is no blessing and no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Often we are diligent, but despite our diligence there is no blessing and no fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Often we exercise our faith; we truly believe God can do something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also pray that He would work, but everything is in vain when God does not bless us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sooner or later, we who serve God must be brought to the point of expecting God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without God's blessing, our faithfulness, diligence, faith, and prayers will be to no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, if we have God's blessing, there will be fruit even if we seem to be wrong or hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, all problems are a matter of God's blessing.</S>
