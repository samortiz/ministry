   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BODY EXISTING IN OUR SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to revolutionize our meetings by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We are the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nevertheless, many times the practical Body has disappeared due to our dumbness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But the Body will return in a practical way whenever we are bubbling.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Body is in our speaking, in our joyful noise.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we come together to make a joyful noise, the Body is present in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the Body in function.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we all function, the Body is present.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if we do not function, the Body is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Body exists in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Corinthians 12:3 says, "Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>. In this verse we find a secret: if we do not speak, we are not in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if we speak, we are immediately in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whenever we say, "Lord Jesus," we are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you do not believe this, I ask you to try it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is easy to get into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Simply say, "Lord Jesus," and you are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Corinthians 12 does not speak about the Body in doctrine, but about the Body in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There can be no Body if there is no practice in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do not function, the Body is not present, because we are not being spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we function, we are spiritual, and the Body is present.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we realize this and practice it, our meetings will be revolutionized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They will be full of joyful noise to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One may say, "Lord Jesus"; another, "Amen"; and another, "Praise the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Still others will say, "Lord Jesus, I love You."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because some brothers and sisters are in the mind or the self, or are occupied by a dumb idol, they do not say anything in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all must learn to be spiritual so that the Body may exist in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all need to utter something and to function.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The difficulty is that we are not accustomed to doing this because of the background and influence of today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, I hope that we shall have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to be bubbling all the time, especially when we come together for the purpose of practicing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although we are the Body, the practicality of the Body is in our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE GIFTS MANIFESTED IN OUR SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 12:4 says, "Now there are differences of gifts, but the same Spirit" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>. How are these gifts manifested?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They are not manifested by our silence, but by our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all must learn to speak something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever you speak, the gift will come forth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many times I have received enlightenment as I was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A number of times I have been compelled to speak by the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to my feeling, I had nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I did not even know what book, chapter, or verse to use.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But as I began to speak, I received a word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As you are speaking, you will sometimes say things of which you formerly had no understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Learn to utter something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the gifts will be manifested.</S>
