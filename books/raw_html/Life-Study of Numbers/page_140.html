<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Sin of Zimri<br>and the Holy Jealousy of Phinehas</H2><P>Numbers 25:6-15 tells us of the sin of Zimri and the holy jealousy of Phinehas. Zimri committed fornication with a Midianite woman (vv. 6, 14-15). The priest Phinehas, who had a holy jealousy for God, killed them both (vv. 7-8). This was not murder, a killing forbidden by the law. On the contrary, it was a sanctified killing, a killing sanctified by God. In verses 10 through 13 we see that Jehovah rewarded Phinehas for this sanctified killing. The reward was the covenant of a perpetual priesthood to Phinehas and to his seed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Revenge of Jehovah on the Midianites</H2><P>In 25:16-18 and 31:2 we see the revenge of Jehovah on the Midianites because of the deceits with which they deceived the Israelites.</P><P>In Balaam's prophecies all the points concerning Israel are very positive. Immediately after these prophecies we have a chapter showing us what kind of people the children of Israel actually were according to their nature. God's view of Israel, revealed in Balaam's parables, is altogether positive. But the actual situation and condition of Israel were extremely negative. In actuality, the children of Israel were a people of fornication and idolatry.</P><P>The Bible presents a full record of the aspects and statuses of God's people, revealing what we are in Adam and what we are in Christ. Numbers 25 exposes what we are in our Adamic nature&#151;people of fornication and idolatry. According to our Adamic nature, we are worthy only of being slain and hanged in the sun. God is jealous, and His jealousy burns upon us. In His burning jealousy He will not spare anything of the Adamic nature.</P><P>Chapters twenty-two through twenty-five give us a clear view of Israel. In the sight of God, the people were heavenly, but according to their real nature, they were fallen and sinful. The situation is the same with the believers today. On the one hand, in Christ we are wonderful; on the other hand, in ourselves we are people of fornication and idolatry whose fate is to be judged by God.</P>
