   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many times we feel that a certain saint is a hopeless case, and we stop with this feeling toward him in our small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We always end our small group meeting in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We would not take Christ as the heavenly ladder in verse 18 to climb up to the heavens with prayer that binds Satan and looses the sinning brother.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We and the church may have no way with this brother, but should we give him up?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus said that we should let him be to us like a Gentile and a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But the Lord went on to say that we have to bind Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to bind the binding one and release the bound one by praying together in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not bring in any opinions by uncovering the fallen condition of the one for whom we are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to bind the binding one, Satan, and we have to release the sinning one, the one bound by Satan, through our prayer in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To be in harmony is as musical sounds in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a piano is played properly, the many keys on the piano are struck in such a way so as to produce harmonious music.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we pray in harmony for certain backsliding, sinning ones, our prayer to recover them becomes like music to the ears of the Father in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the Lord spoke this word, Peter came to the Lord to ask Him a question.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verses 21 through 22 say, "Then Peter came and said to Him, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Up to seven times?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus said to him, I do not say to you, Up to seven times, but, Up to seventy times seven."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It may have been that Peter was the one against whom a brother sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He did not want to forgive this brother again, so he asked the Lord, "How many times should I forgive him?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Seven times?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord said that Peter should forgive him seventy times seven, or four hundred ninety times.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have a spirit to forgive a sinning one up to four hundred ninety times, surely that one will be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do we who are participating in the vital groups have such a spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our vital group may be reducing instead of increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Where are the others?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps some have become degraded or backslidden and others are offended.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may have a reason for each one no longer meeting with us, but would the Lord agree with our reasoning?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord would ask, "Where is your brother?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In other words, the Lord would not let us give people up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We should not give up on anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to go to the Lord again and again with prayers touching heaven by binding and releasing in harmony.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Heaven means God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We touch God, and God comes in to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what it means to live the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If someone wrongs us, we should not be offended but still love him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not go to others to talk about his case.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, we should go to him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should cover his situation by going to him directly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if he would not listen to us, we have to take with us one or two more to see him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, we may have to tell the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the way of the kingdom life in Matthew 18, but we do not practice this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When people sin against us, we talk to our spouse or other saints about it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The first lesson we must learn as members of the vital groups is not to uncover people's weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The story of Ham in Genesis 9 is an illustration of this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His father Noah became drunk, and he was uncovered in his tent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Ham saw his father Noah's nakedness and told his two brothers about it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But his brothers, Shem and Japheth, took a garment, walked backward, and covered the nakedness of their father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As a result of this, Ham was cursed but his brothers received the blessing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>20-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the vital groups, we have to avoid this kind of uncovering talk.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our uncovering talk is a defect that will kill our vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn to cover others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we become aware of someone sinning or of someone sinning against us, we should not talk to others but to the person directly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our natural man always likes to tell others about a person's sins or mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord gave us the step-by-step way in Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These steps are to go to the person alone, then with one or two others, and finally to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If he even would not listen to the church, would we give up?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may stop with verse 17 of Matthew 18 by simply letting him be to us like a Gentile and a tax collector.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we stop here, however, our group will be reducing instead of increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Following verse17 is verse 18 where the Lord said that we have to learn to bind and to release.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have to learn to pray in harmony for a sinning one.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then the Father in heaven will perform what we ask and will be in our midst.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We also have to learn to forgive others countless times.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the reality of the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Paul in 1 Corinthians 5 rebuked the Corinthian believers and charged them to remove a wicked one from their midst v. 13 . Paul's charge was somewhat comparable to that of the Mosaic law in the Old Testament see Deut 13:5; 17:7, 12; 21:21; 22:21-22, 24; 24:7 . But in 2 Corinthians Paul was tender, cautious, and considerate regarding this sinful person.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>After Paul told the saints to remove him, he did not have the peace, so he sent Titus to see the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Titus brought back the good news that this wicked man repented 7:6-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then Paul said that the saints should forgive and comfort this one.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Otherwise, they could be taken advantage of by Satan 2:6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>A vital group is a real representation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The church should learn how to deal with a sinning one by the example of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Paul did not have the peace when this sinful one was removed, so he still did something to take care of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The most important thing is to cherish and forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To visit is to cherish.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Paul sent Titus to visit Corinth in order to cherish the Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Then Paul told them to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Forgiving should follow cherishing.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Then we can recover and gain people.</S>
