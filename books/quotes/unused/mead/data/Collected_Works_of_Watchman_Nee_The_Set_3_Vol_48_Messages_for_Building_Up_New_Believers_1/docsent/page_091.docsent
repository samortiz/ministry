   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAISE AND VICTORY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen that our praise is a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there is more.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to see that praising is the way to overcome spiritual attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many people say that Satan is afraid of the prayers of God's children; he flees whenever God's children kneel down to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is why he often attacks God's children and frustrates them from praying.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a common attack.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we will point out another fact: Satan's greatest attacks are not aimed at prayers; his greatest attacks are aimed at praise.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This does not mean that Satan does not attack prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The moment a Christian prays, Satan begins to attack.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is very easy to talk to people, but the moment one prays, Satan comes with problems.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He will make one feel that it is hard to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But Satan does not attack just prayer; he also attacks the praise of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ultimate goal of Satan is to stop all praises to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prayer is a warfare, but praise is a victory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prayer signifies spiritual warfare, but praise signifies spiritual victory.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whenever we praise, Satan flees.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, Satan hates our praising the most.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He will use all his strength to stop our praising.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's children are foolish if they stop praising when they suffer under adverse environments and downtrodden feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But as they come to know God more, they will find that even a Philippian jail can become a place of songs Acts 16:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Paul and Silas were praising God inside the jail cell.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their praise broke loose all the jail doors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Jail doors were opened twice in Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once they were opened to Peter and once to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Peter's case, the church prayed fervently for him, and an angel opened the door and brought him out 12:3-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Paul's case, he and Silas sang hymns of praise to God, and all the doors opened and the chains broke.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The jailer believed in the Lord on that day, and his whole family was saved in a joyful way 16:19-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul and Silas offered the sacrifice of praise in the jail.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The wounds on their bodies were not yet healed; their pain was not soothed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Their feet were in the stocks, and they were shut in an inner jail of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What was there to be joyful about?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What was there to sing about?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But there were two persons with transcendent spirits, who had surpassed everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They saw that God was still sitting in the heavens; He had not changed at all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They themselves might have changed, their environment might have changed, their feelings might have changed, and their bodies might have been suffering, but God was still sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was still worthy of their blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our brothers, Paul and Silas, were praying, singing, and praising God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This kind of praise, which arises out of pain and loss, is a sacrifice of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This kind of praise is a victory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you pray, you are still in the midst of your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But when you praise, you soar above your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While you are praying and pleading, you are bound by your affairs; you are not out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The more you plead, the more you find yourself bound and pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if God takes you above the jail, the chains, the painful wounds on the body, the suffering, and the shame, you will offer praises to His name.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Paul and Silas sang hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They sang praises to God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They were brought by God to the point where the jail, the shame, and the pain were no longer a problem to them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They could praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When they praised in such a way, the doors of the jail opened, the chains fell off, and even the jailer was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many times praise works where prayer fails.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a very basic principle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you cannot pray, why not praise?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord has placed another item in your hands for your victory and for you to boast in victory.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever you run out of strength to pray and you find your spirit heavily oppressed, wounded, or sagging, praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you cannot pray, try to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We invariably think that we should pray when the burden is heavy and praise when the burden is over.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But please bear in mind that there are times when the burden is so heavy that you cannot pray.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>That is the time for you to praise.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We do not praise when there is no burden; we praise when the burden becomes too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When you encounter unusual circumstances and problems and are bewildered and feel like collapsing, just remember one thing, "Why not praise?"</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Here is a golden opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If you offer your praise at that moment, God's Spirit will operate in you, open all the doors, and break all the chains.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to learn to maintain this lofty spirit, this spirit that surpasses all attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Prayers may not bring us to the throne, but praise surely brings us to the throne at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Prayers may not enable us to overcome every time, but praise does not fail even once.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God's children should open their mouths to praise Him, not only when they are free from problems, hurts, wounds, or difficulties, but even more when there are problems and wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When one lifts up his head in these situations and says, "Lord, I praise You," his eyes may be filled with tears, but his mouth will be filled with praise.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>His heart may be in pain, but his spirit will still praise.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>His spirit will soar as high as his praise.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>He can ascend with his praises.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Those who murmur are foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more they murmur, the more they are buried under their murmurings.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The more they complain, the more they sink into their complaints.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The more they allow their problems to overtake them, the more exhausted they become.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Many people seem to be a little more aggressive; they pray when they have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They strive and struggle to get out of their situations.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even though their circumstances and wounds try to bury them, they are not willing to be buried, and they try to get out by prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>They often do manage to get out by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But there are also times when prayer does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Nothing seems to be able to deliver them until they praise.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You need to offer up the sacrifice of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This means you need to consider praise a sacrifice and offer it up to God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>When you put yourself in such an overcoming position, you immediately transcend everything, and no problem will be able to bury you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Sometimes you may feel that something is trying to run you over.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But as soon as you praise, you will come out of your depression.</S>
