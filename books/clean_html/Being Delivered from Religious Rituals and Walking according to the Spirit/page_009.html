<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST BEING INTRODUCED OUTSIDE RELIGION</h1>
<p>The Lord Jesus was born outside religion, people sought Him outside religion, and people served Him outside religion. People served the Lord, followed Him, and walked with Him outside religion. Before the Lord Jesus began His ministry, He was introduced by His forerunner, John the Baptist. This introduction was also outside religion. The Lord Jesus was introduced outside religion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JOHN&rsquo;S LIVING BEING CONTRARY TO<br />
RELIGION AND CULTURE</h2>
<p>Matthew 3:1-6 says, &ldquo;Now in those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near. For this is he who was spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying, &lsquo;A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths.&rsquo; Now this John had his garment of camel&rsquo;s hair and a leather girdle around his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey. At that time Jerusalem and all Judea and all the surrounding region of the Jordan went out to him, and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.&rdquo; In verse 11 John said, &ldquo;I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John the Baptist introduced Christ. According to the Bible, John was born a priest. The priests were central figures in the Jewish religion. They lived in the temple, wore the priestly garments, and ate the priestly food, the sacrifices. The work that the priests did was also special. In addition to offering sacrifices and setting the bread of the Presence in order, they lit the lamps, burned incense, and lived in God&rsquo;s presence. This was the life of an Old Testament priest. The one who introduced the Lord Jesus was a priest. Ordinarily, a priest should live in the temple, wear priestly robes, eat priestly food, and do the priestly work. However, John the Baptist introduced the Lord Jesus in a way that was contrary to religion. He put religion aside. Not only so, he went against the culture that was attached to religion. The priests lived in the temple, but John lived in the wilderness. The wilderness cannot compare with the temple. The temple was the center of the Jewish religion and a place of culture; whereas the wilderness was completely outside religion and culture. If we had a choice, would we choose the temple or the wilderness? I am afraid that even though many of us shout that we want the wilderness, in our heart we would rather have the temple.</p>
<p>What does the temple signify, and what does the wilderness signify? In Christianity, especially in Catholicism, people like to build chapels with tall steeples and painted glass. There is a logic to this kind of architecture. When we go to an open stadium or to a field, we feel released, but when we walk into a chapel, we are filled with a sense of respect and dare not be casual. This is the culture of the temple. The ritual of worship in the temple is very solemn and serious. First a pastor goes to the platform and leads the congregation to sing, then a music conductor directs the choir to sing a four-part harmony, and then a young lady sings a solo. After singing, a minister leads the congregation in the reading of the Scripture, which is followed by prayer. After all this a doctor of divinity gives a message. Finally, the congregation is dismissed following a benediction: &ldquo;May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.&rdquo; This is religion. This is today&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>To be in the wilderness is to be without regulations, ceremonies, and established rules, that is, to do everything according to the Spirit&rsquo;s leading. The religionists would say that such worship cannot be considered as worshipping God, because there is no religious atmosphere. This is the significance of being in the wilderness. By the eighteenth century the Anglican Church had become the state church of England, and every person who was born in England was born into the Anglican Church. The Anglican Church taught that the word of God is holy and therefore should not be preached outside of a sacred place such as a chapel that had been consecrated and sanctified. The holy word of God could be preached only in a chapel and not anywhere else. Anyone who preached the word of God outside a chapel was committing a serious offense. But God raised up John Wesley as His servant in England. Just like John the Baptist, John Wesley preached in the &ldquo;wilderness.&rdquo; He did not preach in a chapel; instead, he preached on the street. When he spoke, his listeners were touched, some even to tears, and thousands repented.</p>
<p>These examples should help us understand the significance of the temple and of the wilderness. When we sit quietly in a meeting, we are in the temple. Suppose a brother stands up and says, &ldquo;I have a testimony. Hallelujah! I am not in the temple; I am in the wilderness. I am released! I have been set free from religion!&rdquo; Then another brother also stands up and says, &ldquo;Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; If this is the way we meet, we are not in the temple but in the wilderness. May the Lord lead us out of religion, ordinances, and oldness.</p>
<p>There are many experienced, godly, and well-behaved saints. They are somewhat older and frown upon this way of meeting. An older saint once said to me, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you need to balance the young ones. They are too loud. We can hardly bear it any longer.&rdquo; I told him, &ldquo;Perhaps the young ones are too loud. Maybe they should not be so loud, or maybe they should even be silent. However, allow me to say that you need the Lord to balance you. You need to be a little louder. You should take the lead to be louder and stronger than the young ones. I do not know whether or not the young people should be loud, but I do know that you need to be loud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If a brother is for being loud, being loud will be his temple. The younger saints are for being loud. They insist on being loud and are not happy when they must be quiet. The louder they are, the happier they are; thus, being loud has become their temple. The older saints like to be quiet; hence, being quiet has become their temple. However, the Lord does not want us to be in religion. His leading is often the opposite of what we want. If we want to be loud, He may tell us not to. If we want to be silent, He may tell us that we must be loud. Whatever we desire to do may become our temple, but it is not what the Lord wants. What we dislike is often our wilderness, and that is what the Lord wants.</p>
<p>Now that we are clear concerning the significance of the temple and the wilderness, we should ask ourselves which is better. The young people should consider what is their wilderness. If their temple is to be loud, then their wilderness is to be quiet in a meeting. The older saints should also consider what is their wilderness. Their wilderness might include not only being loud but also jumping. When they are loud and jump, they are in the wilderness, and they are against religion. John the Baptist was born a priest. He should have lived in the temple, worn a priestly robe, eaten priestly food, and done the priestly work of offering sacrifices, setting the bread of the Presence in order, lighting the lamps, and burning the incense. However, in order to introduce Christ, he went against religion by living in the wilderness and wearing a garment of camel&rsquo;s hair. Leviticus 11 speaks of ordinances concerning contacting clean and unclean animals and concerning being defiled by them. Verse 4 says that camels are unclean and that the Israelites were not to touch them. However, John the Baptist wore garments made of camel&rsquo;s hair. This was against the religious regulations, but the Lord liked it. May the Lord grant us mercy to see that He is not for religion. John the Baptist ate locusts and wild honey, which was against the Jewish culture and tradition. John the Baptist was not an accident. Christ had come! He is always contrary to religion and does not remain in a religious atmosphere. Therefore, those who introduce Christ are contrary to religion. They live in the wilderness, wear camel&rsquo;s hair, and eat locusts and wild honey.</p>
