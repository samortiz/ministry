<h2 class="head1">DEAD TO THE LAW</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter, we learned that in Romans chapters 5 through 8 there are four important figures: Adam, Christ, the flesh, and the Spirit. We also saw that these chapters speak much concerning a matter that is quite troublesome to many believers&mdash;the law, which was given through Moses.</p>
<p>We must realize that according to Romans 5:20, the law is something that came in alongside Adam and Christ. The word <em>alongside</em> indicates that something is not in the original plan but is in addition to it. Besides Adam and Christ, there is the law. Romans 7:6 tells us that in Christ we are no longer under the law. In light of this truth, I have the boldness to tell you to forget about the law. Do not remember it or pay any attention to it. We have been made dead to the law (v. 4), and we have been discharged from it as well. We have been discharged from the law much like an employee is discharged from an employer. If we have been discharged by an employer, and he tells us to do something for him, we can rightfully deny him his request because we have been discharged from him. We must see that since the law is something that came in alongside, in Christ we are no longer under the law. We no longer have anything to do with the law, for we have been made dead to it and have been discharged from it. We must nevermore be employed by the law.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the enemy, Satan, always bothers us with the law. It is not simple for us to forget about the law. Even if we try our best to forget the law, the enemy always tries his best to remind us of it. Although you may have read in the previous chapter that we are dead to the law, that we have been discharged from the law, and that we therefore have nothing to do with the law, what has been your attitude toward the law? Can you really say that you have had nothing to do with the law? I am afraid that you are still very involved with the law&mdash;not only the law given to us through Moses but the law that you have made for yourself. Moses is not the only law-giver; we too are law-givers. We are the strongest proponents of the law. The laws that we give ourselves&mdash;to be humble, to love our neighbors, to love the Lord more&mdash;are good laws. Yet we must realize that such laws are troublesome and will in fact take us nowhere. We need to arrive at the destination of being conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God, but the law is not the &ldquo;train&rdquo; that will take us there. We have to get off the wrong &ldquo;train&rdquo; and board another &ldquo;train.&rdquo; What is the other &ldquo;train&rdquo;? At the time we were saved, we received the living Christ as our personal Savior. At that time, He came into our spirit. Christ as the Spirit is now dwelling within our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:11). This indwelling Christ as the Spirit is the &ldquo;train&rdquo; which will bring us to our destination. We must forget about the law and instead have fellowship with the Spirit, go along with the Spirit, and align ourselves with Him. Forget about the law. Do not follow it anymore. You have been discharged from the law, so you should no longer think and behave as if you continue to be employed by it. We have nothing to do with the law. Instead, we have everything to do with the living Spirit who indwells us.</p>
<p>Many times, the enemy comes to us under the guise of a &ldquo;good angel&rdquo; (cf. 2 Cor. 11:14). As such, he may suggest to us that we should love the brothers, do good, and try to have a right way of living. In other words, he gives us laws. Although these laws are apparently good, do not believe that they are from the Holy Spirit. They are from the enemy. You should therefore have the boldness to resist them. Whenever the thought comes to you that you should love the brothers or be humble, you must right away say, &ldquo;Satan, go away! I do not accept any word from you.&rdquo; Forget about all the good doings, and forget about all the laws. Instead, keep in line with the Holy Spirit and in the fellowship and presence of the Lord. Tell the enemy, &ldquo;I do not understand what it is to be humble or proud. I do not understand what it is to do good or to do evil. Such things are a foreign language to me. In my &lsquo;country,&rsquo; such things do not exist. In my &lsquo;country&rsquo; the only thing is Christ. The only thing is the Holy Spirit. I do not receive any foreign things&mdash;things not of my &lsquo;country.&rsquo; I receive things only of this &lsquo;country,&rsquo; and all the things of this &lsquo;country&rsquo; must be, and are, Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even if you try by yourself to keep the law of being humble, you will be proud. Although you may be humble outwardly, you will be proud within. You may say to yourself, &ldquo;Although the worldly people are too proud, I am humble.&rdquo; In this light, it is not good to be humble or to love others as a result of striving to keep the law. When you go along with the Holy Spirit and remain in fellowship with the Lord, you will not know what it is to be humble or proud or to be loving or full of hate. You will simply know that you are going along with the Lord in the Spirit. If you take this way, you will be very humble unconsciously. Others may see your humility, but you will not sense it in yourself. All that you will feel is that you are living in Christ. Then you will declare, &ldquo;I do not understand what it is to love, and I do not understand what it is to be humble. I only understand that I am contacting Christ moment by moment.&rdquo; Christ will be your love, and Christ will be your humility. This is the right &ldquo;train&rdquo; to be on. This is what Romans 5&mdash;8 tells us. We are not under the law; we are dead to it. We are living to God in fellowship with Christ in the Spirit (Rom. 6:10; Gal. 2:19).</p>
