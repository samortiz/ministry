FOR MIGRATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Convenient Means of Transportation</h2>
<p>God desires the gospel to spread and churches to be raised up through the migration of His believers. Therefore, He has prepared the environment. God has prepared many things to facilitate the move of the believers, because there is a great need for the spreading of the gospel in this final age. The Gospel of Matthew says that the gospel should be preached in the whole inhabited earth and then the end will come (24:14). The book of Daniel also says that many will go here and there at the time of the end (12:4). There are presently more communication and traffic in human society than ever before, and the means of transportation, such as cars, trains, ships, and airplanes, is unprecedented in quantity and convenience. However, communication and the means of transportation are not merely for our convenience. God wants believers to use various means of transportation in their moving so that His gospel may spread to every place. This is not a small matter.</p>
<p>God uses every mode of transportation&mdash;by land, water, and air&mdash;for the move of the believers in the spreading of the gospel. For example, the many flights between Taiwan and the Philippines make it convenient to travel to Manila to testify for the Lord and to help the church there. I believe that God has prepared every means of transportation between Taiwan and the Philippines so that we can conveniently go forth to spread the gospel and establish churches. Hence, we should enjoy and use this aspect of God&rsquo;s preparation to increase our move for the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Current Trend</h2>
<p>The numerous and convenient means of transportation makes it easy for people to move. There is also a trend for people to be busy and move to many places. Whoever can travel farther and reach more places will have an advantage. Those who are away from home are better off than those who stay at home, and those who go abroad are better off than those who remain in their homeland. People who do not go abroad tend to be unrefined, and those who do not move tend to be simple. This applies to every class in society and to every country in the world. Those who want to have the upper hand must move. God allows this trend so that believers can follow it and take the gospel to every place. This trend to move is part of God&rsquo;s preparation in the environment for the believers to migrate. This trend is often a powerful current that forces the believers to move.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Troublesome Incidents</h2>
<p>Even though there is a trend that causes people to move, and the means of transportation makes it convenient for people to move, many people still will not move. Our lack of willingness to move forces God to change our circumstances. For example, He may allow us to be transferred, to lose our job, or to experience an economic recession. He may allow our business to suffer a financial loss. We may even suffer opposition and attacks or various changes in our personal situation or in our family. These items may force us to move. God even uses wars to force us to move. Even a brother who has no desire to move will flee for his life and move when war comes. Wars change environments, and when the environment changes, many people are forced to move.</p>
<p>If the war had not changed many people&rsquo;s situations, who would have been willing to move from mainland China to Taiwan? However, when the environment changed, people had to move. Even though people suffered loss during the move, this was according to God&rsquo;s good pleasure. Many people would not listen to the gospel or receive the Lord when they were in mainland China, but they were willing to open their hearts, listen to the gospel, believe, and receive the Lord after they moved to Taiwan. Many saints did not love the Lord and were indifferent to spiritual things when they were in mainland China, but since they have moved to Taiwan, their spirit is burning, and they are willing to pursue and serve the Lord.</p>
<p>We must realize that the things that happen to us are allowed by God&rsquo;s sovereign hand; they are not coincidental. God wants us to move, but because we are unwilling, He stretches forth His hand to allow certain things to force us to move and to compel us to go. After God gives a command, His hand will act. He first prepares the environment so that it is easy for us to move and also allows a trend that inclines us to move; He even allows troublesome incidents that force us to move. God desires that His children would move frequently in this age. Therefore, He prepares all kinds of environments to make it convenient for us to move, and He allows all kinds of troublesome things to force us to move.</p>
<p>We need to understand God&rsquo;s intention and know His acts. Jeremiah 8:7 says, &ldquo;Even the stork in the sky / Knows its appointed times, / And the turtledove and the swallow and the crane / Keep the time of their coming; / But My people do not know / The ordinance of Jehovah.&rdquo; We have received God&rsquo;s salvation, and we have His life; as such, how can we be inferior to the birds? We should be those who know the times, know events, and know God so that we can match what God is doing in this age. Otherwise, we will fall behind in our service to God, and we will be unable to catch up with this age.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
