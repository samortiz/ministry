<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Asking Jehovah to Cause Him<br>to Hear His Lovingkindness in the Morning</H2><P>In 143:8 David went on to pray that Jehovah would cause him to hear His lovingkindness in the morning, for he trusted in Him. Then David prayed that Jehovah would make known to him the way on which he should walk, for to Him he lifted up his soul, his whole being, not only his hand.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Saying That He Hides Himself in Jehovah</H2><P>David also told Jehovah that he hid himself in Him. Then David prayed, "Teach me to do Your will,/For You are my God;/Let Your good Spirit lead me/In a plain country" (143:9b-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>K. Blessing Jehovah</H2><P>"Blessed be Jehovah my rock, /...My Lord of lovingkindness and my fortress,/My high tower and my Deliverer,/My shield and He in whom I take refuge" (144:1-2). Here we see that God was many things to David: a rock, a fortress, a high tower, a shield, and a refuge. A rock is something on which to stand; a fortress is for protection; a high tower is for being lifted up above the enemies; and a shield is for protecting the face and the breast. In addition, to David God was a Deliverer and the One in whom he took refuge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>L. Praying That Jehovah<br>Would Bow His Heavens Down and Descend</H2><P>"O Jehovah, bow Your heavens down and descend" (144:5a). Here, in an extraordinary utterance, David asked Jehovah to bring His heavens down to him and descend to him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>M. Declaring That the People<br>Are Blessed Whose God Is Jehovah</H2><P>"Blessed are the people whose God is Jehovah" (144:15b). Because Jehovah was David's God, David included himself among those who are blessed.</P><P>I believe that if you spend time on all these precious points in David's prayers, the taste of your prayers will be changed. Sometimes our prayers are intimate, but at other times they are cold and without intimacy. It is helpful, therefore, to consider the intimacy in David's final prayers to Jehovah.</P>
