<h2 class=head2>The Need to Be Clean and Pure</h2><p>While I was still living in Taiwan, my daughter needed to be operated on. An American brother in Taipei, who was our family doctor, told us he needed a clean place where he could perform the operation. He told us that a certain room was not qualified to be used for the operation, because while he would be operating some germs might come down from the ceiling. I was also told that in surgery all the knives and instruments in the operation must be fully clean and sterile with absolutely no germs. If there are any germs, the operation can bring these germs into the patient. This experience helped me very much. A great many times I told the Lord, “Lord, I must be clean. If I am not clean, then when I touch Your work my unclean hands would bring germs into the saints.”<p>I began to learn this one lesson in 1932. During that year, I realized that a certain sister needed a good Bible. I had the intention to buy her one and to give it to her as a gift. Immediately within me I was checked. The question came to me, “Are you purely of the Spirit?” I dared not to answer. This did not mean that I had any sinful or dirty intentions. I did not do anything for a few days until I was fully checked by the Lord. Then I could say that I was fully pure to give this Bible to the sister without letting her know who gave it to her. This was the beginning for me to learn the lesson that all my motives should be purified to touch the work of the Lord, to touch the church. Otherwise, I would unconsciously bring germs into the church, into the saints, and into the Lord’s work. In this chapter, I am preaching the gospel you need. You need to hear this gospel. Even during this training I have checked with myself, “You are going to hold this training with all the leading ones. Are you pure? Can you say that you are so pure that you would never bring any germs into the brothers?” I am always in fear and trembling before the Lord to allow Him to purify my intention and my motive.<h2 class=head2>The Need of a Clear Vision</h2><p>In order to have this kind of dealing, we need a clear vision of the Lord’s move, of His New Testament ministry, of His Body, and of His testimony. Also, we need a clear and thorough vision concerning ourselves. We need to be exposed thoroughly. Our entire being needs to be opened up to the light to see where our heart is, where our mind is, where our will is, where our intention is, and where our motives are. We need to be so enlightened. Then we will be afraid to keep anything regional. I do not serve a few churches in my region. I serve the Lord’s Body. If we were all here serving the Lord’s Body, no local church would say that their meetings were better, higher, or more living than another locality. There would be no thought of telling other saints to come to your locality. You would consider that all the churches are the same as part of the Lord’s Body.<p>Under His sovereignty, you are not assigned to take care of other churches. You have been assigned to take care of the churches in your region. You must realize, though, that these churches are not your churches but are the Lord’s churches and are a part of His Body. If you had this kind of realization, you would never say that the meetings in your region are higher. You also would never tell anyone that if they are not satisfied with the situation in their region to please come to your region. In addition, you would never tell people not to go to another region because the churches there are not worth seeing. As long as you utter these kinds of words, this indicates that you only honor the churches in your region.
