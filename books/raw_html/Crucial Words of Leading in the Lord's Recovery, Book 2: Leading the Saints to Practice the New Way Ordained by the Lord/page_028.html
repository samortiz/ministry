 <h2 class="head2">Avoiding Giving Tediously Long Prophecies,<br />
Three to Five Minutes Being Most Fitting</h2>
<p>We must avoid giving tediously long prophecies; otherwise, we will occupy too much time and take away the opportunity for others to function. According to our experience, especially in the initial stage of the practice of prophesying, three to five minutes is sufficient. In Luke 1 and 2 three people prophesied. None of the three were giving a prediction. This is not to say that there was no prediction in their speaking but that principally they were prophesying. The first to prophesy was Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist; the second, was Mary, the mother of the Lord Jesus; and the third, was Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist. Elizabeth&rsquo;s speaking was the most simple and probably did not exceed two minutes, yet it was an excellent prophecy. Mary&rsquo;s speaking was probably about two minutes in length, and Zachariah probably spoke a little longer. His speaking was probably no more than seven minutes. None of them spoke in a lengthy way; rather, they were appropriate in speaking the Lord into others.</p>
<p>Prophesying requires learning. First, we must learn to be skilled in God&rsquo;s word. In order to be skilled in God&rsquo;s word, we must be well versed in the Scriptures. Consider the speaking of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah. Mary&rsquo;s speaking, in particular, was made up of over thirty quotations from the Old Testament; it can be said that her speaking was entirely a composition of quotations from the Old Testament. The fact that this young woman was so familiar with the Old Testament and was able to speak according to the Scriptures is a proof that she belonged to a learned family. God&rsquo;s choosing was right. He chose such a woman to give birth to the Lord Jesus. Her son James was very pious, and her other son, Jude, was well versed in the Old Testament. The Epistles they wrote contain numerous references to the Old Testament. The Epistle of James speaks of many things related to the Old Testament, and although Jude&rsquo;s Epistle consists of only one short chapter, it mentions many stories from the Old Testament. This proves that the whole family was familiar with the Bible. As far as the Scripture is concerned, they were a well-read family. If we desire to learn to prophesy, we need to be well versed in the Bible.</p>
<p>Second, we need to have experience. The words of Elizabeth, Mary, and Zachariah all contain a considerable amount of experience. Their speaking out of their experience and their applying of God&rsquo;s word produced wonderful prophecies. It is amazing that at the beginning of the New Testament, when John and the Lord Jesus were conceived but were not yet born, these three persons prophesied. They did not speak predictions nor did they speak in tongues; rather, they prophesied. Their prophesying was a cooperation between God and man; it was man speaking for God in coordination with God. It sets the New Testament principle of speaking for God in the meetings. Hence, when we prophesy in the meetings, we need to be familiar with God&rsquo;s written word, include our experience, and have an instant inspiration. When we speak in such a way, it is prophesying. We need to have more practice and learning based on our seeing.</p>
<p>It is best if the elders in the various localities are able to serve full time. I absolutely believe that Mary, Elizabeth, and Zachariah must have all been &ldquo;full-timers,&rdquo; meaning that they contacted the Holy Scriptures and read God&rsquo;s word all day long, without being distracted by other things. Zachariah was a priest. A priest should be well versed in the Scriptures. If he had not been familiar with the Scriptures, he would not have been qualified to be a priest. Moreover, the words spoken by Elizabeth, Zachariah&rsquo;s wife, and by Mary prove that they too had spent much effort studying the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The elders among us have to hurry to work every day, and after a week of work, they are physically exhausted. The fact that they are able to enjoy a verse or two in the Bible every morning is quite good. However, to merely enjoy two verses from the Bible in the morning cannot make them rich in the Word. If they want to have something to share in the meetings, they need to diligently memorize the books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians. They need to be so familiar with these important Epistles that when they open their mouth, they will be able to prophesy as those whose tongue is the pen of a ready writer (cf. Psa. 45:1). Understanding the Bible and having personal experiences makes prophesying an easy matter.</p>
<p>Perhaps some may ask, &ldquo;Does this mean that all the brothers and sisters should be full-timers?&rdquo; Of course, this would be best. If there were thirty thousand people on the earth doing nothing but studying the Bible every day, it would be marvelous. When this group of people would meet together, every one of them would be able to prophesy, and the effect would be immeasurable. Today all of Christianity lacks this kind of people. As a result, all of their meetings involve only one person speaking with everyone else listening. Consequently, their condition is very poor.</p>
