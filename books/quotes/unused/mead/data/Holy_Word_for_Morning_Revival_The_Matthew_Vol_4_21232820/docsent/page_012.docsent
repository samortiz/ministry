   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 17 DAY 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 24:27-31</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>27 For just as the 1 lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so will the coming of the Son of Man be.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>28 Wherever the 1 corpse is, there will the 1 vultures be gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>29 And immediately 1 after the tribulation of those days, the 2 sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>30 And at that time the 1 sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the 2 tribes of the 2 land will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming 3 on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>31 And He will send His angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will 1 gather His chosen together from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other end.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>27 1 The second coming of Christ has two aspects: one is the secret aspect, related to His watchful believers; the other is the open aspect, related to the unbelieving Jews and Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The lightning here signifies the open aspect, which will take place after the great tribulation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>29-30 , whereas the thief's coming in v. 43 signifies the secret aspect, which will occur before the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Lightning may be considered as being concealed in a cloud, waiting for an opportunity to flash forth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In a similar way, Christ will be clothed with a cloud Rev 10:1 in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear, like a flash of lightning striking the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the Lord's coming like a flash of lightning will be a sign of the end of the Lord's parousia see note 3 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This implies also that the Lord is like electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>28 1 Taken in context, vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>15 and 21 imply that at the end of this age Antichrist will be the cause of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is he who will need to be judged and destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All people in Adam are dead 1 Cor 15:22 ; thus, the evil Antichrist, who with his evil armies will war against the Lord at Armageddon Rev 19:17-21 , is in the eyes of the Lord a stinking corpse, good for the vultures' appetite.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Furthermore, in the Scriptures both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to an eagle Exo 19:4; Deut 32:11; Isa 40:31 , and the swift, destroying armies are likened to flying eagles Deut 28:49; Hosea 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the vultures here, being predatory birds of the eagle kind, refer undoubtedly to Christ and His overcomers, who will come as a swift, flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them at Armageddon, thus executing God's judgment upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>29 1 This is strong proof that the open coming of Christ will take place after the great tribulation v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>29 2 This supernatural calamity will occur in heaven after the great tribulation, at the close of the end of this age see note 12 2 in Rev 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This differs from the calamities of the sixth seal and the fourth trumpet Rev 6:12-13; 8:12 , which will occur at the beginning of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>30 1 We have no way of knowing what this sign is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, it must be supernatural and clearly visible perhaps like the lightning in v. 27 , appearing in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>30 2 The tribes here are the tribes of the nation of Israel, and the land is the Holy Land.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the Lord's appearing, all the tribes of Israel will repent and mourn Zech 12:10-14; Rev 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>30 3 By this time the Lord will no longer be in the cloud but on the cloud, appearing to the people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the open aspect of His second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>See note 1 2 in Rev 10 and note 14 1 in Rev 14.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>31 1 After the great tribulation, at His coming back to earth, the Lord will gather together to the Holy Land the scattered Jews from all parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will be the fulfillment not only of the Lord's word in 23:37 but also of God's promise in the Old Testament see reference 31 a .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suggested daily reading: Life-study of Matthew, pp.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>727-731; Hymns: #124, #888</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
