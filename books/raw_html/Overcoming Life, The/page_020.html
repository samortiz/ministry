 <h2 class="head1">BOASTING IN ONE&rsquo;S WEAKNESSES</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 12:9 says, &ldquo;He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness. Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me.&rdquo; Have you seen this? Weakness is not something that one should lament over or weep about. Weakness is something that one should boast in. You may have said, &ldquo;Thank and praise the Lord because He has made me overcome,&rdquo; but have you ever said, &ldquo;Thank and praise the Lord because He has made me fail miserably&rdquo;? You thank and praise the Lord for giving you patience, but have you thanked and praised Him for your impossible temper? Have you thanked and praised Him for your pride? Have you thanked and praised Him for your jealousy? Have you thanked and praised Him for your uncleanness within and for your sin? If you have these problems, you should thank and praise the Lord for them. The first thing you must do is realize that you cannot make it. The second thing you should do is give up trying to make it. The third thing you should do is thank and praise God for not being able to make it. Hallelujah! I cannot make it. Hallelujah! I cannot make it!</p>
<p>Why did Paul say, &ldquo;I will rather boast in my weaknesses&rdquo;? The word &ldquo;boast&rdquo; is &ldquo;glory&rdquo; in the original language. Paul said that he considered his weaknesses to be his glory. This is because his weaknesses afforded Christ the opportunity to manifest His power and the opportunity for this power to tabernacle over him. Christ&rsquo;s power cannot tabernacle over those who do not have any weaknesses. Only those with weaknesses can experience the tabernacling of Christ&rsquo;s power. I would rather boast in my weaknesses because my weaknesses afford the Lord an opportunity to work in me. They afford the Lord an opportunity to manifest His power and to do something in me.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, do you have a sin which you cannot even confess? Do you have something which you cannot consecrate to God? Do you have a hindrance which you cannot remove? Is there any grace which you miss before the Lord? What are you going to do? Are you going to be sorrowful? If you are, you are a friend of the young man. He was sorrowful, and you are sorrowful as well. In the end, you will take the same way he did. He went away in sorrow, and you also will go away in sorrow. But you do not need to be sorrowful. The mistake of the young man did not lie in his realization of his impossibility but in his failure to realize God&rsquo;s possibility. The mistake of the young man did not lie in his own inability but in his failure to apply God&rsquo;s ability. It is not a sin to discover one&rsquo;s own weakness, but it is a sin to refuse to believe in God&rsquo;s strength. It is not a sin to be unable to give away one&rsquo;s money, but it is a sin to refuse to believe that God can enable a person to give away his money. It is not a sin to have a bad temper, but it is a sin to refuse to believe that God can become one&rsquo;s patience. It is not a sin to have an insurmountable sin, but it is a sin to refuse to believe that God can overcome such a sin for a person.</p>
<p>It is a glorious thing for a man to realize that he is helpless. The Lord&rsquo;s purpose was to show the young man his helplessness. But when the young man returned home, he was not happy but sorrowful. Once the Lord shows you that you cannot make it, He will immediately show you that God can make it. The Lord does not show you your inability in order to discourage you. He shows you your inability in order for you to believe that He has an excellent opportunity to work in you. You should say, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot make it and I do not even want to try to make it. Thank and praise You that I cannot make it.&rdquo; When you see that you cannot make it and that you are totally incapable of doing anything, and when you see that only the Lord can make it, you will thank and praise Him. You will realize that it is very natural to thank and praise the Lord. In the past, you might have grieved over your weakness or wept over your sins. But today, you can boast and praise. You can say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You because I cannot make it. I thank You because I have no way to overcome. I am not able. I rejoice because I am not able. I rejoice because I cannot do anything. Only You can do everything.&rdquo; If you do this, you will overcome.</p>
