<h1 class="title">THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:26-27, 29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE WASHING OF THE WATER IN THE WORD</h2>
<p>In this chapter we come to Ephesians 5. The key to experiencing chapter 5 is the phrase <em>the washing of the water in the word</em> (v. 26). This extraordinary phrase contains three items: washing, water, and the word. The natural human mind cannot understand these items, but they are crucial in the church life. In order to have a proper church life, we must have the washing of the water in the word.</p>
<p>The washing of the water in the word is not the same as the cleansing of the blood of Christ. The blood of Christ cleanses us from our sins. The blood washes away our sinful deeds, our uncleanness, but the washing of the water in the word deals with our spots and wrinkles. Spots are scars from wounds, and wrinkles are signs of aging. In the beginning of the church life in a locality, the church is fresh and young; there are no spots or wrinkles. However, after a period of time wrinkles appear because the church gradually &ldquo;ages,&rdquo; and spots appear because the church has been wounded and has scars.</p>
<p>The blood washes away our sins, but the water in the word washes away our spots and wrinkles. The washing of the water in the word is not outward but inward. If my face is dirty, I just need to wash my face, and it will be clean. However, if there are wrinkles on my face, the wrinkles will remain even if I wash my face with the best soap. The best way to remove wrinkles is to become young. We have wrinkles because we are old. If we could make ourselves young, the wrinkles would spontaneously disappear.</p>
<p>If we want to be young, we need good metabolism. Our metabolism depends on our eating and drinking. If we eat nutritious food, we will receive more nutrients, and these nutrients will wash away our oldness. If we do not eat for three days, we will begin to wilt and decline, but if we eat nutritious food, the nutrients in the food will replace our oldness. The nutrients in the food that we eat cause a metabolic washing within us.</p>
<p>Similarly, in order for a Christian to grow, he must daily eat spiritual food, that is, the word of God. The words of the Bible are our spiritual food. In Matthew 4:4 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that proceeds out through the mouth of God.&rdquo; The word of God, that is, the word that proceeds out through the mouth of God, is our spiritual food. We should eat the words of the Bible not just once a day but many times a day. We eat physical food more than once a day. Similarly, the more times we eat spiritual food, the better. Some believers read the Bible once a day. This is better than not reading the Bible, but it is not sufficient. It is better to read, to eat, five times a day&mdash;in the morning, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening, and at night. Some may say that they do not have time to read the Bible so often; however, if they are willing to set aside certain times, they will be able to read the Bible in this way. It takes me three and a half minutes to eat a snack in the afternoon. When I eat some fruit and drink a cup of water, I am revitalized and my strength is restored. If we are willing to spend three and a half minutes enjoying the Lord&rsquo;s Word, our strength will be renewed.</p>
<p>Some want to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s Word, but they do not remember any verses. Hence, it is best to have a pocket-sized Bible. When I was around twenty years old, I took a Bible apart according to its books and made each book into a booklet. I carried these Bible booklets with me to work and read a few verses from them during my break. I spent less than five minutes to &ldquo;snack&rdquo; on the Word. We can all practice this. Since then I have memorized many verses. I have memorized almost the whole book of Ephesians, and I know the content and crucial points of each chapter.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I close my eyes in the afternoon, the water in the Lord&rsquo;s word washes me, sanctifies me, nourishes me, and cherishes me. Sometimes I spend a few minutes not to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word but to pray. Other times I muse upon a section of the Lord&rsquo;s Word while I take a walk. This is a &ldquo;snack.&rdquo; If I wake up very early in the morning and cannot fall back to sleep, I snack on a portion of the Lord&rsquo;s Word. This message is the issue of eating Ephesians 5 in the morning. In other words, I am speaking what I have eaten. I cannot count how many times I eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word in one day. Sometimes I eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word more than ten times. We should all be the same and daily eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word sufficiently in order to be supplied and washed by the Lord.</p>
<p>There is water in the Lord&rsquo;s word. This water refers to the life supply, the flowing of the divine life. When the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they were supplied by water that flowed out of a smitten rock (Exo. 17:6). This water signifies the divine life. In John 4 the Lord Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo; (vv. 13-14). In 7:37-38 the Lord Jesus stood and cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; The next verse says, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive&rdquo; (v. 39). These verses indicate that the living water is the Spirit. In Revelation 22:1 John says, &ldquo;He [the angel] showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; The river of water of life in the New Jerusalem signifies the flowing life of God. Today this living water is in the Bible. The words in the Bible contain the life supply. This living water is in the words of the Bible.</p>
<p>If we merely read the Bible with our eyes and understand it with our mind, we will gain knowledge but not living water. The living water is mysterious and spiritual. This water is not black and white letters; the letter can impart only knowledge. Deep in the words of the Bible is the life supply. This supply is the spiritual and mysterious water of life.</p>
<p>In order to touch the water of life, we must exercise our spirit through prayer. Man is tripartite. Our body is our outer part; our soul, including our mind, is in our body; and our spirit is even deeper than our soul. If we read the Bible with our eyes and our mind only, we are using just two parts of our being: our body and our mind. As a result, we will gain only knowledge. We must use our third part, that is, our spirit, when we read the Word. Then the living water of life in the Word will be transfused into us, and we will receive the life supply. This is why we must pray-read the Word. Praying enables us to exercise our spirit. Reading with our eyes and understanding with our mind will not give us life. We must pray the Lord&rsquo;s words and enter the depths in order for the living water to flow into our spirit, quench our thirst, and refresh, nourish, and strengthen us.</p>
<p>We must learn to exercise our spirit and pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word so that the life supply in the Word will become washing water. In the physical realm the metabolism that is triggered by eating food is a kind of washing. The same applies to our spiritual life. If we eat the Lord&rsquo;s Word, we will receive the life supply. This supply will trigger a metabolic washing that washes away the negative things within us; the spots and wrinkles will disappear. Then the church will become holy and be without blemish, defect, spot, wrinkle, or any such things in order to be presented as a glorious church to the Lord (Eph. 5:27).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_027.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_029.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Great Mystery-Christ and the Church &nbsp; pg 28</div><br></body></html>
