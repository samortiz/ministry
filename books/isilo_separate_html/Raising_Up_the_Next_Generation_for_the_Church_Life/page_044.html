<h2 class="head1">THE FOSTERING OF A HOLY LIFE<br />
FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>The first chapter of 1 Thessalonians covers two main points: the structure of a holy life for the church life and the origin of a holy life for the church life. The structure is composed of the work of faith, the labor of love, and the endurance of hope. The origin of such a life is the preaching of the gospel and the acceptance of the word preached, an acceptance resulting in turning to God from idols, serving a living and true God, and waiting for the Son. Now in chapter 2 we come to the third aspect of a holy life for the church life, the aspect of fostering.</p>
<p>Although the word <em>fostering</em> cannot be found in 1 Thessalonians 2, the fact of fostering can be seen in this chapter. Here Paul likens the apostles both to a nursing mother and to an exhorting father. This means that the apostles were mothers and fathers to the new believers. They regarded the believers as children under their fostering care. Just as parents care for their children, fostering their growth, so the apostles cared for the new believers. Thus, in 1 Thessalonians 2 we see the fostering of a holy life for the church life. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians,</em> p. 96)</p>

<p>We have emphasized the fact that in 1 Thessalonians we have a word to beginners, to new believers. Those who are working with young people or with new believers can receive from this book both a direction and an outline to follow. If they follow this outline and direction, they will lay a good foundation in their work with new believers. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians,</em> pp. 129-130)</p>

<p>Do not think that in the recovery we regard work higher than life. No, we need to concentrate on life. The church is a family. The church may also be compared to a farm or a garden. A family is a place where children grow up, and an orchard is a place where trees grow and produce fruit. Paul&rsquo;s concern in chapter 2 is with the growth of his children. He is fostering the young believers so that they may grow. We may also say that he is watering, nourishing, and cherishing the tender young plants so that they may grow in life. This is the reason that instead of giving the believers a great deal of teaching, he presents them a pattern of life. This pattern of a proper living is actually Paul himself. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians,</em> pp. 108-109)</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREACHING IN POWER, IN THE HOLY SPIRIT,<br />
AND IN MUCH ASSURANCE</h2>
<p>In 1:5 Paul continues, &ldquo;For our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.&rdquo; The apostles not only preached the gospel; they lived it. Their ministering of the gospel was not only by word, but also by a life which displays the power of God, a life in the Holy Spirit and in the assurance of their faith. They were the model of the glad tidings they spread. (<em>Life-study of 1 &amp; 2 Thessalonians,</em> p. 12)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES&rsquo; ENTRANCE</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 2:1 says, &ldquo;For you yourselves know, brothers, our entrance toward you, that it has not been in vain.&rdquo; The apostle stresses repeatedly their entrance to the believers (1:5, 9). This shows that their manner of life played a great role in infusing the gospel into the new converts. It was not only what the apostles said, but also what they were.</p>
<p>The apostles came to the Thessalonians with the gospel in such a way that the Thessalonians were convinced. The apostles&rsquo; entrance was not in vain. They were a pattern of how to believe in the Lord and follow Him. Because many came to believe in the Lord Jesus through the apostles, a church was raised up in less than a month. This happened not mainly as a result of preaching and teaching, but through the kind of entrance the apostles had among the Thessalonians.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING THE GOSPEL IN MUCH STRUGGLE</h2>
<p>Verse 2 of chapter 2 continues, &ldquo;But having suffered previously and having been outrageously treated, even as you know, in Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God in much struggle.&rdquo; In the preaching of the gospel, the apostles experienced God. They enjoyed Him as their boldness in the struggle for the gospel. They were bold not in themselves, but in God, even after they had been outrageously treated by the Philippians. Suffering and persecution could not defeat them because they were in the organic union with the Triune God. According to verse 2, they spoke the gospel of God in much struggle. This indicates that while they were preaching, they were fighting, because persecution was still going on. Hence, they were struggling and speaking the gospel to the Thessalonians in the boldness of God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_043.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_045.html">Next</a> </body></html>
