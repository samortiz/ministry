   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Two Kidneys</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Most Tender Part of the Inwards</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we need to consider what the two kidneys signify Lev 3:4, 10, 15 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of all the inward parts, the kidneys are among the smallest.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, the kidneys are the most tender of the inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that we need some small yet most tender things within us toward God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Within us God does not want big things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Within us the Father wants small things which are very tender and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The kidneys are protected by the fat, which means that the small yet tender and precious things within us toward the Father are protected by the inward riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we are speaking of here is altogether based upon our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do not have the rich experiences of life, we cannot have the small, tender, and precious things within us toward God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With the inwards, which are so sweet to the Father, the size means nothing, but the quantity does.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more fat there is, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With the life of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels, there were the riches, the abundance in quantity, but there was no greatness in size.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>An illustration of this can be seen in John 7.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this chapter the Lord's brothers in the flesh told Him to go to Judea and manifest Himself to the world vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>3-4 , but the Lord responded by saying, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready" v. 6 . Such an instance shows us the tenderness, the preciousness, and the riches of life within the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His life was not one of a great work, a great career, or a great activity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although He was the Son of the Almighty God, He was willing to be limited in not doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His brothers in the flesh challenged Him to manifest Himself publicly, to do something great to make a name, but He said His time had not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He liked to be small.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In His life with the Father, there was an inward restriction.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This shows us the kidneys of the peace offering offered to the Father with the smallness, the tenderness, and the preciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No human word can adequately express this revelation, but this instance in John 7 shows us the Lord's inward being as typified by the kidneys of the peace offering with the fat around them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are great, spiritual giants according to the way of today's Christianity, we will not be able to offer the fat with the two kidneys.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we read the four Gospels to see the life of Jesus, we can see His inward being as typified by the inward parts of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can see that His inward being was rich in life with something tender and small, yet so precious to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This fully corresponds with our experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates that strength and power signified by the thigh do not satisfy the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father desires the inward parts of Christ signified by the fat and the kidneys.</S>
