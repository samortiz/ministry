<h2 class="head1">THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING<br />
A LIFE THAT BEARS FRUIT</h2>
<p>Many people speak of the normal Christian life, but to be normal is not only to be freed from sin according to the experience of Romans 6. This is only part of being normal. The most normal Christian life is a life that bears fruit. It is absolutely not normal for a branch on a vine to bear no fruit for many years. We must not forget that we are branches of the vine. As branches of the vine tree, we need to bear fruit.</p>
<p>Many of us may not care whether we bear fruit. Suppose, however, that one day a good speaker comes to us speaking in a marvelous way to stir us up. Then we will be on fire and pray constantly, praying even through the night. After a few weeks, we may be able to bring several hundred people to the Lord. However, this is abnormal. Branches on a vine are not stirred up by a good speaker and suddenly bear great clusters of grapes. Fruit produced in a miraculous way does not remain, and it may not even be genuine. We do not desire this kind of fruit. The Lord said, &ldquo;I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain&rdquo; (John 15:16). If many people are brought to the Lord by miraculous prayer and preaching, we may proclaim that this is marvelous. However, after a short time they may be nowhere to be seen. Everyone bears children according to their own kind. Therefore, we should not blame the ones whom we bring to salvation if they do not remain as proper fruit. They do not remain because we are not proper. In order to bring forth normal fruit, we ourselves need to be normal.</p>
<p>If we mean business to have a proper Christian life, we must bear fruit in a normal way. This can never be done in a miraculous way. We should not expect to pray in an extraordinary way and then miraculously bring many people to the Lord. Branches bear fruit in a very normal way. When I was young, I lived near a vineyard. I saw that every year the vines brought forth only one crop. In the spring the vines began to bud, and in the fall the crop came, one crop a year. We should not dream that we can bear fruit every day or every month. Rather, we must all bear fruit in a normal way.</p>
<p>To bring one person to the Lord every year is normal and easy. However, in the past year many among us may not have brought one fruit to the Lord that remained in the church life. This proves that we are not normal. What then shall we do? I cannot give you a way or method to bear fruit. According to a method, we have no way, but according to life, there is a way. Therefore, not to bear fruit means that we are wrong and abnormal. We must all go to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, grant me to be normal in the matter of fruit-bearing. Every year I must bear some fruit. Lord, as a branch of Your vine I need a yearly crop. I do not pray for a great amount of fruit in a miraculous way. Rather, I simply want to be normal, bearing at least one fruit per year.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH LIFE, FRUIT-BEARING,<br />
AND CARING FOR NEW ONES<br />
BEING TESTS OF OUR CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>The test for whether a brother or sister is proper is threefold. The first test is the church life. Even if someone is considered holy and high, if he cannot go along with the church life, he is wrong. The second test is fruit-bearing. We may be in the church, go along with the church, and have no problem with the church, but if we do not bear fruit, we are also wrong. Some can pass the test of the church life, but they cannot pass the test of fruit-bearing. The third test is whether we are caring for younger believers. John 15 speaks of fruit-bearing, and John 21 speaks of feeding the lambs (v. 15). We need to take care of the little lambs. In most Christian churches, there is the shortage of the proper preaching of the gospel. In some churches, however, there is a prevailing gospel preaching, but there is still a shortage of caring for the little ones. One hundred may be saved and baptized, but only five or six remain. The rest fall away because of the shortage of the proper care. We should not complain that the leading brothers are inadequate for the need of shepherding. Rather, we must blame ourselves. If everyone among us would care for one younger one, the shepherding among us would be adequate. However, many of us regularly attend the church meetings and easily pass the test of the church, but not many pass the second test, and it is even more difficult to pass the third test. To pass only one test is to receive a grade of thirty-three percent, which is a failing grade. This is not a small matter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FRUIT-BEARING REQUIRING US TO PAY A PRICE<br />
AND TO BE DEALT WITH</h2>
<p>The reasons that we do not bear fruit are that we are too sloppy and slothful and that we do not like to be dealt with. If we mean business with the Lord to bear fruit, we need to pay a price. We must bear fruit at any cost. All mothers know that to bear children is not easy. Mothers have no enjoyment in pregnancy; they have only suffering. This is the price they pay to be fruitful. We may not desire to pay much of a price, but Paul said, &ldquo;But I, I will most gladly spend and be utterly spent on behalf of your souls&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:15). Paul spent whatever material possessions he had, and he was spent in whatever he was in his spirit, soul, and body. If the Lord has mercy on us that we pick up the burden to bear fruit, we will immediately see that we must pay a price. If we are willing to pay the price, one of our relatives may be saved, and one of our schoolmates may be brought into the church life.</p>
<p>Fruit-bearing forces us not only to sacrifice but also to learn the lessons to be broken. Even if our spouse or children cannot force us to be broken, fruit-bearing will force us to be broken, if we mean business with the Lord. However, if we do not desire to be broken, we will be fruitless. Every branch of the vine that bears fruit suffers the breaking. If there is no breaking, the life-juice cannot flow out. We must not only sacrifice; we must be broken. Why have none of our relatives and in-laws been brought to the church life? Why do some of the young people not bear fruit in their school? It is simply because we are too whole. We should not say that our relatives have not been brought to the Lord because they are not good enough. We should say that it is because we are too whole. We need to be broken. Perhaps we are proud and would never humble ourselves before our in-laws. However, in order to preach the gospel in a living, prevailing way, we must be lowly, right, willing, zealous, and flexible toward people. If people are not ready to speak concerning the gospel at a certain time, we must be willing to spend ourselves to come again at another time. This is a breaking. We may prefer to choose our own time, and if we cannot choose the time, we may forget about speaking to someone. On certain days it may not be convenient to visit people, and on other days we are too busy. Then on Saturday we may need rest, and on the Lord&rsquo;s Day we will need more rest. We may make an excuse, saying, &ldquo;I work five days a week, nine hours a day, and after working all day, I have to attend the church meetings. Then on the Lord&rsquo;s Day there is more than one meeting. How can I have time to contact people?&rdquo; We may have a good excuse every week, but after fifty-two excused weeks the year will be lost. We must not excuse ourselves. We may have many relatives, but we may have brought none of them to the Lord simply because we excuse ourselves too much. We must not remain whole. Our entire life must be broken. If we would be broken, it will be easy for us to bear fruit. Even though we are here in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, our Christian life is not normal because the increase among us is less than twenty or thirty percent. Therefore, we must pass through the test of fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>To care for the little lambs costs us even more. To bring forth a child is not easy, but to raise him up is even more difficult. To bring forth a child requires nine months of suffering, but to raise a child takes at least twenty years of suffering. Child-raising is very costly. Before a sister is married, she may not have any change regardless of how much others minister to her, but after she marries and has several children, these little ones become the best trainers to her. Many things that she could not and would not do, she is now able and willing to do. She becomes able to do everything for the sake of her children. For this reason I like to see all the young sisters marrying and bringing forth little &ldquo;trainers.&rdquo; Nothing can train us as well as marriage life with little children. Even if no one else can help a sister, her little ones will train her, and she will learn the lessons. Many sisters can testify to this. The proper church life is a marriage life; therefore, we should all bear some younger ones and care for them. If we do not, we are not normal.</p>
