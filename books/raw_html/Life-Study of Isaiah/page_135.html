<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Christ's Being the Covenant<br>to Israel for Their Security</H2><P>In verses 9 and 10 we have Christ's being the covenant to Israel for their security. Verse 9 says, "This is like the waters of Noah to Me,/When I swore that the waters of Noah/Would not overflow the earth ever again;/So I have sworn that I will not be angry with you,/Nor will I rebuke you." In verse 10 the word covenant is used. "For the mountains may depart,/And the hills may shake,/But My lovingkindness will not depart from you, /And My covenant of peace will not shake,/Says Jehovah who has compassion on you." Christ as the Servant of Jehovah being the reality of this covenant is a surety of Israel for their security (42:6; 49:8).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Jehovah's Building Up of Israel in Beauty<br>and Israel's Enjoyment in Peace</H2><P>In 54:11-17 we have Jehovah's building up of Israel in beauty and Israel's enjoyment in peace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Jehovah Himself<br>Laying Down Her Stones in Dark Mortar</H2><P>To the one who is afflicted, storm-tossed, and not comforted, Jehovah says that He Himself will lay down her stones in dark mortar and lay her foundations with sapphires (v. 11). The Hebrew word translated dark mortar literally means antimony, referring to a dark cement used for setting off the brilliance of precious stones. In verse 12 Jehovah goes on to say, "I will make your battlements of rubies,/And your gates of carbuncles,/And all your borders will be precious stones."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. All Her Children Being Taught of Jehovah</H2><P>All her children will be taught of Jehovah, and the peace of her children will be great (v. 13). She will be established in righteousness. She will be far from oppression, for she will not fear, and far from terror, for it will not come near her (v. 14). Verse 15 says, "Behold, they may fiercely attack you, but it is not of Me;/Whoever attacks you will fall because of you."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Heritage of the Servants of Jehovah</H2><P>Jehovah has created the blacksmith who blows the fire of the coals and brings out a weapon for its work; He has also created the destroyer to ruin (v. 16). Therefore, He declares, "No weapon that is formed against you will prosper,/And every tongue that rises up to judge you, you will condemn./ This is the heritage of the servants of Jehovah,/And their righteousness which is of Me" (v. 17). This is Jehovah's declaration to the entire universe that the security of Israel is maintained by Christ, who is the covenant for them.</P>
