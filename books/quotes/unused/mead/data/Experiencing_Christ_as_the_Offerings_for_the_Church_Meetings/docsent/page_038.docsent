   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD, THE WORD, THE FLESH,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John chapter one is a crucial chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It tells us that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that the flesh is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now you can see that four things are one: God, the Word, the flesh, and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These are not four separate things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They are not even four things in four steps or four stages.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are one thing in four different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And the flesh is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GRACE AND TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 14 goes on to tell us that when God as the Word became flesh to be the tabernacle, grace and truth came.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Two new aspects were added.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now you may say that grace and truth are the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the tabernacle is here, you enjoy grace, and you touch truth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some Christians who know these spiritual, biblical terms, grace and truth, would define grace as unmerited favor, and they would mainly consider truth to be doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you ever heard that grace is the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you ever heard that the truth is the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you have never entered into the tabernacle, you don t know what truth is, and you don t know what grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When you enter into the tabernacle, you not only know the grace, you enjoy the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Grace is more than unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Grace is free enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Grace to us today is the free enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today we enjoy as grace the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have the enjoyment of such a God who is processed, who is triune, who is all-inclusive, who is indwelling, who is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The enjoyment of such a God is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our God is processed, and now He is such a Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is also indwelling us in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has been located.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you are seeking God you don t need to go anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Isn t this wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>HOW TO ENJOY THE PROCESSED GOD</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is in your spirit, but how shall you enjoy Him?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have used our physical body many times in the past as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our physical being does have a bios, a biological life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not even doctors who have been working on this body for years can tell us the mystery of the bios in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is here, but no one can fully understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is too mysterious!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We also have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is mysterious, but it is not superstitious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don t forget that even electricity is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although it is mysterious it is still believable.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We must know how to enjoy the processed and even located God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we don t know how to enjoy God, we could never have the proper meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our meetings would become services.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We would need either some bishops or pastors or ministers or preachers or elders or leading ones to take care of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They would need to take care of the meetings because you come with nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You come empty-handed.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever you come with nothing and someone else has to function, that is a service.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all have to hate that kind of thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To have the proper meeting needs the proper enjoyment of the very God whom we have.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>CHRIST AS THE WAY TO ENJOY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is why we come to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This Gospel tells us the way to enjoy the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the beginning was God, and this God was the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This Word became the flesh, and this flesh is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The tabernacle is just the grace we enjoy and the truth we realize.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After this comes a seventh aspect, the Lamb of God 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Chapter after chapter there are so many items in the Gospel of John for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This book also shows us the way to enjoy this wonderful portion, our processed, located, and indwelling God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This Gospel has the only verse in the entire Bible which says that the Lord Jesus is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many Christians have applied this verse to their situation, saying that the Lord is the way for them to get a job and the Lord is the way for them to get a wife and the Lord is the way for them to discipline and educate and teach their children.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Of course this is not bad, but it is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You have to learn to apply Christ as the way to enjoy God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Have you ever prayed this way?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>O Father, I don t know how to enjoy You, but the Son, Jesus Christ, whom You have given me is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you read John 14:6 in its context you can see that Christ is the way for you to contact God and to enjoy God, not just for you to get a job or to get a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you don t know how to take Christ as your way to enjoy God, you don t really know that He is the way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Gospel of John shows us that Christ is the way to enter into God and to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>According to the types in the Old Testament, we can see clearly that no one is qualified in himself to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every one who wants to enter into the tabernacle needs to pass by the altar where two offerings are needed the sin offering and the trespass offering.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Without these two offerings you are not qualified, and you have no way to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If you enter into the tabernacle without these two offerings, you will die.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God as the tabernacle is here and ready for us to enter so that we may enjoy grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But the problem is that you are a person with sin in your nature and with trespasses in all your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How could such a person enter into this tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You need the Lamb of God!</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Actually the Gospel of John tells us even more.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was not only the Lamb to take away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He was also the brass serpent in chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He was such a brass serpent lifted up on the tree, that is, on the cross to nail the old serpent, Satan, to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In chapter one as the Lamb of God, He took away our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In chapter three as the brass serpent, He nailed Satan, the old serpent, the source of all the problems, on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It is through Christ as our sin offering and our trespass offering that we enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Without the offerings we do not have the qualification to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We come to the altar, to the cross, not just to come to the altar, but to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We come to the cross with the intention of entering into the processed, tabernacled God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Our intention is not to enter into God in the third heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>If He is only in the third heavens we cannot enter into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>But He is the tabernacled God in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>You must realize that His tabernacling is His dwelling and even His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>According to the concept in the New Testament, tabernacling and indwelling are synonyms.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>When God is indwelling you, that means that He is tabernacling in you.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We come to the cross taking Him as our sin offering and our trespass offering with the intention of entering into the tabernacled God.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>And this God into whom we enter is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Even the tabernacle as a type was not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It had an outer court and an inner court.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It had so many items of furniture, including the showbread table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>God is not so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We need to experience Him and to enjoy Him and to participate in Him.</S>
