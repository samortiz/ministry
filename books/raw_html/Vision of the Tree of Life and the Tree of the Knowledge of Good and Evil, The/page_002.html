        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TREE OF LIFE BEING<br />
THE CONTROLLING VISION OF THE BIBLE</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation. These four chapters present an important vision. Regrettably, most people do not see the vision contained in these chapters. Many books that expound the Bible have been written, but it is difficult to find a book concerning the vision in these four chapters of the Bible. In other words, the vision in these four chapters has been hidden and closed to man for almost two thousand years.</p>
<p>Once, in a meeting we said that the tree of life signifies God coming to be man&rsquo;s life. A Western missionary who had labored in China for many years was present in that meeting. She told me that she had never heard anyone say this and that she had never read this in a book. For two thousand years chapters 1 and 2 of Genesis and chapters 21 and 22 of Revelation have been closed to man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING AND ENDING CHAPTERS<br />
OF THE BIBLE BEING CONNECTED</h2>
<p>What is presented at the beginning and the end of the Bible? If we have received revelation from the Lord, we will know that the first two chapters of Genesis are consistent with the last two chapters of Revelation. We can also know that from Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 there is a big &ldquo;detour.&rdquo; We can illustrate this with a line. The first segment of the line represents the first two chapters of Genesis, and the following segment represents the last two chapters of Revelation. These two segments should form one straight line. However, beginning from Genesis 3 the line veers off and does not become straight again until after Revelation 20. Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is a detour. The first two chapters of Genesis should have been connected directly to the last two chapters of Revelation.</p>
<p>An example of a big detour is the journey of the children of Israel from Egypt into Canaan. The children of Israel could have entered Canaan after they left Egypt. However, because of their evil heart of unbelief at Kadesh-barnea, they made a detour that lasted for almost forty years (Deut. 1:19-40; Num. 14:1-3, 26-34). The extra time that they spent in the wilderness was a detour. Similarly, there is a detour in the Bible, beginning in Genesis 3 and continuing to Revelation 20. It is difficult to find a spiritual book concerning the beginning and ending chapters of the Bible. Most books cover the content of Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 and hence concern only the detour. Many believers are at a loss concerning the first two chapters of the Bible, and they are not clear concerning the last two chapters. It is hard to find a book in Christianity concerning these four chapters of the Bible. Hence, here we will consider the revelation contained in these four chapters of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PLAN AND ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S WORK<br />
BEING IN THESE FOUR CHAPTERS OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The revelation in the beginning two chapters and the ending two chapters of the Bible is extremely important. The vision of God&rsquo;s plan and the accomplishment of His plan in the universe are contained in these four chapters. We may have read the first two chapters of Genesis, but we may not be clear concerning the focus of these two chapters. Most theologians and Bible scholars say that these two chapters concern creation. If God opens our eyes, we will see that these two chapters do not emphasize creation. The first two chapters of Genesis are concerning four things: life, image, dominion, and a bride. Among these four items life is the unique cause; the remaining three items are the issue of life. God&rsquo;s entering into man to be life brings in three issues. First, life causes man to have God&rsquo;s image in order to be like God; second, life subjects man to God&rsquo;s authority so that man can have dominion for God; third, life makes man God&rsquo;s counterpart, God&rsquo;s bride, to be joined to God (1:26-28; 2:18, 21-24). This is the revelation contained in the first two chapters of Genesis.</p>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis are a picture that portrays God&rsquo;s intention. If we would receive light and look at this picture with a sober mind, we will understand that God&rsquo;s intention is to be man&rsquo;s food in order to enter into man and be man&rsquo;s life. This is indicated by God&rsquo;s putting Adam in front of the tree of life (2:8-9). Man will experience three issues when he is mingled with God. Man will have God&rsquo;s image to be God&rsquo;s expression. Man will be the means by which God has dominion on the earth; he will be subject to God&rsquo;s dominion and will be able to represent God&rsquo;s dominion. Man will also become God&rsquo;s bride to be out of God, unto God, and joined to God. This is the revelation presented in the first two chapters of Genesis. If a person sees only God&rsquo;s creation of the heavens, the earth, all things, and man in these two chapters, he sees only the background, not the main object. A painting has both a main object and a background. The purpose of the background is to bring out the main object. However, people often pay attention to the background while neglecting the main object.</p>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis contain many details concerning creation. These details are a background for the main object, which is the divine life. God created all things in order to gain a realm, and He created man in order to gain a corporate vessel. God wants to enter into man as food in order to be man&rsquo;s life and constituent so that man may be transformed in nature. This is indicated by the precious materials in the river that went forth from Eden (2:10-12). Thus, man will possess God&rsquo;s image to express God, and man will be subject to God&rsquo;s authority to be a means for God to have dominion. Furthermore, man will be God&rsquo;s counterpart to be joined to God. This is indicated by Eve being Adam&rsquo;s counterpart (vv. 22-23). This vision concerning God&rsquo;s eternal intention is revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis. The picture portrayed in these two chapters shows what God wants to accomplish in the universe. Hence, these two chapters can be considered as a blueprint, or plan, that God will fulfill.</p>
<p>In the first verse of chapter 3 God&rsquo;s adversary, Satan, came in to frustrate God&rsquo;s plan by bringing sin into man, the vessel that God intended to use. Thus, beginning from chapter 3 there is a detour in which Satan, sin, the world, the lust of the flesh, and negative things come in. Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is a detour that includes Satan, sin, the world, and the flesh. At the end of Revelation God comes in to judge Satan, sin, the world, and the flesh; He also judges the issue of these four items&mdash;death (20:14). When these problems are solved, the whole universe is restored. Ultimately, in the last two chapters of Revelation there is a holy city, New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb (21:2, 9). This city is joined to God as one in Christ and is full of God&rsquo;s image, shining forth God&rsquo;s glory and light (vv. 10-11, 23).</p>
<p>In the city is the throne of God and of the Lamb. The city is under God&rsquo;s dominion and thus is the means by which God exercises His dominion. The river of water of life proceeds out of the throne, and on both sides of the river grows the tree of life (22:1-2). In the New Jerusalem God has accomplished the plan that is revealed in the first two chapters of Genesis. His original plan will be worked out. The life of God is the intrinsic factor of the New Jerusalem. This life is always flowing, and it issues in a group of people who are full of God&rsquo;s image to be His corporate expression and who are under His throne to be the means by which He exercises dominion. These people are also God&rsquo;s counterpart; they are out of God, unto God, and joined to God.</p>
<p>We must see that the first two chapters and the last two chapters of the Bible are the main line of the Bible; the rest of the chapters are the secondary line. Satan initiated the secondary line and brought in sin, which produced the flesh and the world. The final result of Satan, sin, the flesh, and the world is death. Genesis 3 through Revelation 20 is mainly concerning these five matters. Satan, sin, the flesh, the world, and death are frustrations to the Lord&rsquo;s work in the universe that He created, and God is using various means to deal with them. The lengthy portion from Genesis 3 to Revelation 20 concerns the history of God&rsquo;s fight with Satan, sin, the flesh, the world, and death. These five matters have been causing trouble in God&rsquo;s universe and frustrating God&rsquo;s plan, but God has not given up. At the end of the Bible God deals with these five things: He judges the world, the flesh, sin, and Satan and destroys death. Then the detour ends, and God&rsquo;s plan is accomplished.</p>
<p>For two thousand years few in Christianity have remained on the main line. Most Christians have focused on the things in the detour. Few have touched the main items of God&rsquo;s plan. Most people gloss over the items in first two chapters of Genesis but talk at length concerning the items in chapter 3, such as how Satan came in, how man sinned and fell, how man became flesh, and how God accomplished redemption. Concerning the book of Revelation, most Christians pay attention to the seven seals, the seven trumpets, the seven bowls, the great tribulation, and the second coming of the Lord Jesus, but they do not touch the last two chapters in depth. Christians have a clear view of the things in the detour and talk much about them, because the stories in the detour correspond to their human concepts. However, they do not have a clear view of the revelation in the beginning and the ending chapters of the Bible, because these four chapters are concerning God&rsquo;s eternal intention, which is not according to human concepts.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
