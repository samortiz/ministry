<h2 class="head2">Being Nourished and Blessed<br />
by Following the Ministry</h2>
<p>With Paul and Timothy we see an excellent pattern. As we have pointed out, Paul told Timothy to lay &ldquo;these things before the brothers,&rdquo; referring to the things which he was writing in this Epistle. However, before Timothy could lay these things before others, he first had to feed on them himself. He had to digest them, assimilate them, and allow them to saturate his inner being. Then he would be able to lay them before the brothers. Today we should follow Timothy&rsquo;s example and lay before the saints the things with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry. How wonderful the church life would be if we all did this! However, if we turn from the ministry and seek to produce something different, we may give place to differing teachings. It was not Timothy&rsquo;s intention to teach anything different from what Paul taught. Rather, he would lay before the brothers what he had received from Paul.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to say a word concerning my burden in putting out the Life-study Messages. The aim of these messages is to produce groceries for the local churches. My burden is not mainly to &ldquo;cook&rdquo; these spiritual groceries; it is to produce them and supply them to the churches that every local church may be a well-stocked supermarket, filled with a variety of nourishing foods. If the leading ones in a local church lay before the saints the riches contained in the Life-studies, the saints will be abundantly nourished. I have received many letters testifying that this has happened.</p>
<p>It is a fact of history in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed. But those churches which neglect the ministry and try instead to do something on their own have become a failure. However, in saying these things, I wish to make it very clear that I by no means insist that the churches or the saints read the Life-study Messages. To repeat, my burden is to produce groceries. The churches and the saints are free either to use them or to disregard them. But if the saints cast away the nourishment found in these messages, I wonder what they will feed on. We are what we eat. If we eat the &ldquo;groceries&rdquo; produced in today&rsquo;s religion, we shall be part of religion. Let me say in frankness and honesty that the leading ones need to take &ldquo;these things&rdquo; and lay them before the saints that they may be nourished. (<em>Life-study of 1 Timothy,</em> pp. 70-71, Witness Lee)</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. SPEAKING THE SAME THING ACCORDING TO<br />
THE TASTE OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Speaking the Same Thing</h2>
<p>We are here for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I am not doing my own work, and you are not doing your own work. We all are bearing one testimony; we all have our shoulders under the &ldquo;staves&rdquo; of the &ldquo;ark.&rdquo; Since we are all bearing the one testimony, we all should speak the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10). But the speaking in certain places is leading the saints in the direction that is away from the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Such speaking may not be wrong or unscriptural. It may be right and scriptural, but eventually it will lead the saints in a wrong direction.</p>
<p>If we go in a straight line, we shall reach a proper goal. But if our direction is off, eventually we shall reach a goal that is not the goal of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Even after a short period of time, trouble may come to the recovery through your way of speaking scriptural things, that is, through your speaking of good messages. Although there is nothing wrong with your speaking, it may lead others in a wrong direction. If so, eventually that will become a problem to the whole recovery.</p>
<p>The recovery is not merely a local matter. Although the recovery is in your local church, the recovery is universal. If you lead those in your locality in a direction that is off from the recovery, then there will be two directions&mdash;the direction in the recovery as a whole and the direction in your locality. If you teach in a way that leads others in a different direction, some may receive your teaching, but many of those in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will reject it. They will not &ldquo;swallow&rdquo; your teaching.</p>
<p>From experience we know that the one who teaches differently is the first one to be sacrificed. This means that if you teach differently, you run the risk not of sacrificing the recovery but of sacrificing yourself. We all need to practice Paul&rsquo;s word to Timothy: &ldquo;Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently&rdquo; (1 Tim. 1:3). Instead of teaching differently, we should all speak the same thing.</p>
<p>Since I am the one who has given the Life-study Messages, it is rather awkward for me to speak about them. However, I can say that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been going on by the ministry. If the ministry had not come to this country, the recovery would not be prevailing here. The recovery came through the ministry, and the recovery has been going on by the ministry. If you, then, speak something that is off from the ministry, surely the recovery will not follow that speaking. It is a dream to think that the entire recovery will follow the speaking that is different from that of the ministry. Therefore, if you speak differently, you will exclude yourself from the recovery by your speaking. No one else will exclude you; you will be excluded by your own speaking, concept, and attitude.</p>
<p>It is no doubt true that every local church has its own jurisdiction. However, we have taught very strongly that each local church is not a Body of Christ; all the churches together are the one Body. Because of this, what happens in one place will affect other places. This means that what you do in your locality will affect the other local churches. News travels quickly from one place to another. Also, the saints who are now in your locality later may move to a different locality.</p>
<p>Those who teach differently are not able to stop the ministry in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The ministry brought the recovery to this country, and the ministry is still carrying the recovery. How can the ministry receive dissenting teachings? Those who teach differently will cause trouble first to themselves and then to others and to the recovery. They will damage others and then cause damage to the recovery. Such damage is the responsibility of those who teach differently.</p>
<p>We all need to consider what we minister, preach, and teach. This means that we need to take care of all the churches. Before the Lord I can testify that this was my practice in China, and it is my practice today. When I was in China speaking in a certain locality, I considered how the other churches might be affected by my speaking. I asked myself, &ldquo;Will this cause trouble to the other churches? How will it affect them? Will the entire recovery be able to accept this?&rdquo; I realized that if I did not consider my speaking in this way, I could cause trouble. I could speak something that the recovery as a whole would not receive. I could speak something that others would reject because it was contrary to their taste.</p>
