<h1 class="title">THE NEED OF THE IMPOTENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 5:1-10, 14, 21, 24-26, 39-40, 43, 46-47</h1>
<p>John 5 says, &ldquo;After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porticoes. In these lay a multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, and withered, waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel went down from time to time in the pool and stirred up the water; the first then to step in after the stirring up of the water was made well of whatever disease he was being held by. And a certain man was there, who had been thirty-eight years in his sickness. When Jesus saw this one lying there and knew that he had already been a long time in that condition, He said to him, Do you want to get well? The sick man answered Him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me. Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your mat and walk. And immediately the man became well, and he took up his mat and walked. Now it was the Sabbath on that day; therefore the Jews said to the one who had been healed, It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your mat...After these things Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, Behold, you have become well; sin no more so that nothing worse happens to you...Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills...Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life. Truly, truly, I say to you, An hour is coming, and it is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live. For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He gave to the Son to also have life in Himself&rdquo; (vv. 1-10, 14, 21, 24-26).</p>
<p>Verses 39 to 40, 43, and 46 to 47 say, &ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that testify concerning Me. Yet you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life...I have come in the name of My Father, and you do not receive Me...For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote concerning Me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw that the first two kinds of people whom the Lord Jesus contacted were the moral and the immoral. In this chapter we will consider the impotent, which is the third kind of people whom the Lord Jesus contacted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE IMPOTENT</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus can meet and supply the needs of all kinds of people. He can supply the need of the moral as well as the need of the immoral. In human society there is another kind of people: the impotent. People who are impotent know what they should do, but they do not have the strength to carry it out. They know that they should do good, and they are willing to do good, but they have no strength to do good. The Lord Jesus can also meet the need of such people. The man in John 5 was impotent because he had been sick for a long time. He was so sick that his entire body was weak and unable to move.</p>
<p>This man was not only sick and weak but also lonely. He was lying by the pool with the hope that he would be healed. However, he lacked the strength to be healed, and no one came to help him. As a result, he remained in a miserable and helpless condition.</p>
<p>Such an impotent and helpless man is a symbol of numerous people who are impotent, lacking strength. His miserable condition is a portrait of many people who do not have the strength to free themselves from their problems. This man represents all the impotent people in the world. Therefore, when we consider his condition, we are actually considering the condition of all the impotent people in the world. This is also our condition, because every one of us is impotent.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_017.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_019.html">Next</a> </body></html>
