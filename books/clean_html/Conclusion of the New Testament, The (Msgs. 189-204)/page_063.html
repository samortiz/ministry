<h2 class=head3>1. For All the Local Churches</h2><p>The evangelists are for all the local churches. This is indicated by the record concerning Philip’s gospel preaching in Acts 8. In verse 40 we are told that “passing through he brought the good news to all the cities.”<h2 class=head3>2. Doing the Particular Work of Preaching the Gospel</h2><p>An evangelist does the particular work of preaching the gospel. Acts 8:5 says, “Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.” Philip also preached the kingdom of God as the gospel. Acts 8:12 tells us, “When they believed Philip, bringing the good news concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.” He preached the kingdom of God as the gospel just as the Lord did (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:43). Acts 8:26 and 40 also indicate that, as an evangelist, Philip did the particular work of gospel preaching.<h2 class=head2>D. The Shepherd-teachers</h2><p>The fourth category of special gifts in Ephesians 4:11 is the shepherd-teachers. The shepherd-teachers here are not two kinds of persons; rather, they are one kind. This means that if a believer is to shepherd the saints, he must surely teach them. Likewise, if he teaches the saints, he will also shepherd them. Shepherding needs teaching, and teaching needs shepherding. Therefore, the shepherd-teachers are one category of persons.<h2 class=head3>1. A Gift for the Local Church</h2><p>The shepherd-teachers are a gift for the local church. This is indicated by Acts 13:1, which tells us that there were teachers in the church in Antioch. In Acts 7 Stephen was manifested as a teacher, and Acts 11 reveals that both Barnabas and Saul were teachers. Acts 11:26 says that Saul and Barnabas “were gathered in the church and taught a considerable number.”<h2 class=head3>2. Teaching in the Local Church Meetings</h2><p>The shepherd-teachers teach in the local church meetings. This is indicated by “a teaching” in 1 Corinthians 14:26. In the church meetings we need a word of teaching. Such teaching should minister Christ with the church as His Body.<p>Teaching is different from prophesying. Teaching is the speaking based on prophesying. The teachers take what is given in the prophets’ prophesying and teach the saints according to it. This is teaching. The prophets are those who speak for God and speak forth God by God’s revelation and who sometimes speak with inspired prediction. Teachers are those who speak the truths according to the apostles’ teaching (Acts 2:42) and the prophets’ revelation.<h2 class=head3>3. The Third Placed by God in the Church</h2><p>The shepherd-teachers are placed third by God in the church. For this reason, in 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul says that God has placed some in the church “thirdly teachers.”
