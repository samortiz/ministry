   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SEEING LIGHT IN GOD'S LIGHT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Obsession is a tragic thing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's children must not be obsessed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who are obsessed do not see the true nature of things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the following paragraphs we will consider the way to see the true nature of things and the way to be saved from obsession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah 50:10-11 says, "Who among you fears Jehovah;/Who hears the voice of His servant;/Who walks in darkness/ And has no light?/Let him trust in the name of Jehovah,/And rely on his God./Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands,/Walk into the light of your fire/And into the firebrands which you have lit./You will have this from My hand:/You will lie down in torment."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 10 is not that easy to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we change the punctuation according to the following way, the meaning may become somewhat clearer: "Who among you fears Jehovah; who hears the voice of His servant who walks in darkness and has no light?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let him trust in the name of Jehovah, and rely on his God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means, "Is there anyone among you who fears the Lord and obeys the voice of His servant?"</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If someone wants to obey the voice of the Lord's servant yet walks in darkness and does not have the light, what should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He should "trust in the name of Jehovah,/And rely on his God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 11 says, "Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands,/Walk into the light of your fire/And into the firebrands which you have lit./You will have this from My hand:/You will lie down in torment."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the Israelites were walking in darkness and did not have the light, it was natural for them to kindle a fire and surround themselves with firebrands.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Is it not good that they walked in the light of their fire and in the firebrands that they kindled?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No, the result was that they would lie down in torment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Spiritual darkness cannot be removed by human fires.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Light comes from God alone and does not come from man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man's fire will never bring about genuine spiritual sight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our own fire can never be the source of spiritual light.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some Christians have said, "How can you say that I was wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I do not think that I was at all wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I do not feel that I was wrong at all."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may think that you are not wrong, you may feel that you are not wrong, and you may believe that you are not wrong, but are you reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Some Christians have said, "I have considered a certain matter for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can say for sure that it should be done this way or that way."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Can you make judgment just because you have thought a matter over?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to God's Word, this is not the way for Christians to know things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can try your best to think, but what you come up with is just human fire.</S>

   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The difference between the Old Testament and the New Testament is that the Old Testament shows men what is right and what is wrong through outward laws, while the New Testament shows men the true nature of things through the Holy Spirit dwelling within.</S>
