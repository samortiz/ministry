   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Word Being in the Beginning, and the Word Being God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With respect to the Lord's relationship to us, the first aspect of the mystery in the Gospel of John, as shown in the outline, is that the Lord Jesus is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the Lord came, He began to have a relationship with us as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John does not begin with, "In the beginning was God," but he begins with, "In the beginning was the Word."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fact that God is referred to as the Word indicates that He has a relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose I came to you and just looked at you, and let you look at me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we just look at one another without saying anything, nothing will happen.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once I open my mouth to speak, however, a relationship begins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I speak, you respond.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I speak again, you respond again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With such speaking and responding, a relationship develops. such a relationship is initiated and formed by words.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the story of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Words are the medium by which two parties develop a relationship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every day news happens all over the world. we develop a relationship with the news because it is communicated to us through the words of the media, including radio, television, magazines, and newspapers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to have a relationship with man, the Triune God must be the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If He were not the Word, He would have no way to have a relationship with the created man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, throughout the whole Bible the Word is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even when God created all things, He did it through His word, which is Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, I am speaking to you now, and the words I speak are just myself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If I speak wrongly, not only my words will be condemned, but I myself will also be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am one with my words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two my words and I are inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you were indicted in court for speaking wrongly and declared guilty by the judge, you could not say, "Your Honor, I am not wrong; it was my words that were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may condemn my words, but do not condemn me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Word is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>FOUR STEPS TAKEN BY THE WORD IN HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the beginning of the Gospel of John, John speaks about the Word. this proves that God wants to have a relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can God have a relationship with man?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The first step is that He was incarnated to bring God into man; the second step is that He lived a human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years; the third step is that through His death and resurrection He brought man into God; and the fourth step is that He became the Spirit to abide and live in those who have believed into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Concerning Christ as the Spirit The Last Adam Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Concerning the fundamental truth of Christ being the Spirit, there are two crucial verses.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first verse is 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some people argue that the life-giving Spirit here is not the Holy Spirit but the Spirit of Christ as a person. they say that just as we humans have a spirit, so Christ also has a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They also say that when this Jesus Christ died, He became life-giving Spirit; however, this verse does not say that the last Adam simply became "Spirit," without any modifier.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, it says that He became "a life-giving Spirit," with the modifier "life-giving."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This indicates that this Spirit can give life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May I ask, What kind of spirit can give life?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Can the human spirit give life?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If Jesus Christ had not become the Spirit, and if the Spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45b refers only to the spirit He had as a man, can that human spirit give life?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since 1 Corinthians 15:45b says explicitly that He became a "life-giving" Spirit, then it simply means that He became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit is a very crucial revelation, and we cannot delete the word life-giving as it pleases us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, 2 Corinthians 3:6 says, "But the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only God can give life and enliven man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Besides God, no one in this universe can give life and enliven man.</S>
