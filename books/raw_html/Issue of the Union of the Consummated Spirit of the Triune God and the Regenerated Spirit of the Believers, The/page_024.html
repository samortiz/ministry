<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THIS CONSTITUTION IS THE UNION<br>AND MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</H2><P>The building up of the Body of Christ is the constitution of the Triune God and the tripartite man in the Spirit of God and the spirit of man. This constitution is the union and mingling of God and man. It is divinity constituted into humanity to be man's dwelling place, and it is humanity built into divinity to be God's dwelling place.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THIS IS THE HARVEST OF THE TRIUNE GOD'S SELECTION IN ETERNITY AND OF THE WORKS<br>OF HIS OLD CREATION, REDEMPTION,<br>AND NEW CREATION IN TIME</H2><P>What was presented above is the harvest of the Triune God's selection in eternity and of the works of the old creation, redemption, and new creation in time. All these works of God in eternity and in time result in the building up of the Body of Christ. This is His harvest.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VII. IN SUCH A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT, GOD IS<br>THE BENEFACTOR AND MEN ARE THE BENEFICIARIES</H2><P>In such a great achievement, the operating Triune God is the Benefactor, and the tripartite men who respond to His operation are the beneficiaries. One is the Benefactor while the others are the beneficiaries. Both are also the satisfied enjoyers. God enjoys man, and man enjoys God. How wonderful this is!</P><P>In conclusion, the Body of Christ is the Triune God's eternal heart's desire and His ultimate purpose. It is also something that the tripartite men can never think of nor hope and ask for. However, this is the Triune God's anticipated multiplication and His expected increase. This multiplication and increase are God and Christ multiplying and increasing within us, the redeemed people. This is something beyond the imagination of all the religionists and philosophers, yet we who have been graced by God can actually taste it and participate in it for eternity.</P>
