   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: Will saying, "Lord, I hand myself over to You" in whatever we are doing help us to learn the Lord in those things?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Answer: It is not necessary to speak so much.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To hand ourselves over to the Lord is to abide, to remain, in the Lord John 15:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we are abiding in the Lord, remaining in Him, we are handing ourselves over to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as we are remaining in the Lord, it is not necessary to say much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just be simple, and remain in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As fallen beings, we find it easy to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is our habit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we are independent, we are not in the hand of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Still, because we are religious, we would not do wrong things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, we may do many good things independently, even recklessly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is nothing wrong with loving a brother, going to a meeting, or reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, we may do these things according to ourselves, independently of the Lord and not according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is dangerous to be independent of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should not care merely for where we are going or for what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should care mainly that where we go or what we do is by and with the Spirit and not by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Question: We have seen that we should follow the trained way in preaching the gospel, and we have also seen that we should be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How do we reconcile these two ways?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Answer: They do not need to be reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On our face, the eyes are the eyes and the nose is the nose.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We also have a mouth with teeth and a tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot "reconcile" them; they are what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we hear a Christian teacher talking about the "tongue," we like to make every part of our face a "tongue."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, we still need the "eyes," the "nose," and the "ears."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have said that in visiting people, we have to form a team; we should not go by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to follow some regulations and not our opinion, and we are blessed if we go out in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, it is very easy to do this in legality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Forming a team to go to people of the lower class is effective, but if we always go out in this way, we will gain only people of the lower class; we will miss the other classes of people.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It may be that a middle or upper-class household will not open the door to a team.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this case we must change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We love all classes of people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have to use different ways to gain different people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our way to reach people must be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way we use in Taiwan is good for Taiwan, but it may not fit in America.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All of us, especially the co-workers and the leading ones in all the churches, have to study the flexible way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Chinese have been very conservative for many centuries, but they have gradually changed their concept since coming to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today many Taiwanese merchants are very flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They can manufacture many things according to the patterns given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They do not produce things according to their own taste but according to the buyers' taste.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They make clothing for South Americans according to the South American tastes, and they make clothing for northern Europeans according to the European tastes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not be so legal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we are flexible, we will surely be able to touch any kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All human beings are reachable and touchable, but we must find a way to touch them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we live in a neighborhood with a few men who are fond of fishing, it may even be necessary to go fishing with them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To go fishing without gaining fishermen as our goal is to fall into the world, but if we go to reach people, we will not be going fishing; we will be going preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After we go fishing with them three times, they will thoroughly open to us, and we will have an opening in their community.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By this we can see that there are many ways to reach people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should be flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is a way to contact any kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Question: Is there literature available that categorizes people for gospel preaching and can help us to reach different kinds of people?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Answer: We have such material in Chinese that has not yet been translated into English.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is helpful in a general way, but if we rely on this too much, we may frustrate the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must be desperate in gospel preaching because we will all stand before the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we are not desperate, we will have a problem with the Lord both in this age and in the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must endeavor and be desperate to reach people to gain every kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to pray that the Lord would burden the saints and make them desperate to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Question: After I preached the gospel to my employer, he was saved, but he has not gone on.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Answer: We should not preach the gospel without coming to people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We must reach them and approach them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we only preach the gospel to them, they may be saved, but if we do not come to them, they can never be fully brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should first lay a good foundation by visiting them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is inadequate only to invite them to come to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They can listen to a message, but even if they believe, they may still go away.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The best way to approach someone is to go to their home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It makes a big difference if we go to their home to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Distributing tracts is not as effective as preaching the gospel by visiting people.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To reach people by visiting them really works.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To reach people requires us to be absolute for gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we are teaching school, we are not merely teaching; we are living for Christ's preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is what we are short of today.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Thank the Lord that today there are many new ones among us because of the door-knocking, and some new churches have been raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the past, when we insisted on bringing people to the meeting hall, we did not baptize many.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, in the new way, many people have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I hope that all of us would be stirred up to preach the gospel as priests of the gospel in the new way.</S>
