   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE ELDERS NEEDING TO LEAD THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD 3 Scripture Reading: Heb 10:25 EXERCISING MODERATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR OUR DAILY NECESSITIES AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>NOT FALLING INTO THE SNARE OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a person becomes thirty years old, he steps into middle age, into a time of change.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At this time, both the Lord and the world are competing for him; this is the time that decides whether he will be used by the Lord or by the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord said, No one can serve two masters Matt 6:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This does not mean that every elder should drop his job completely; nevertheless, we should at least allocate our time and give the world only a certain amount of our time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, if someone does not have a clear leading and burden from the Lord to drop his job and serve the Lord full time, he should keep his job.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, he should not give all of his time to the world; otherwise, he will fall under the hand of Pharaoh in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Bible says that no one can serve two masters; it does not require us to drop our jobs, but if we have a job, we should budget our time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As long as we have enough to feed our family and take care of our children s education, we should exercise restraint and not fall into the snare of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through years of observation, we have seen a great number of people throughout the world wasting all of their time in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To waste their time in the world is to waste their time in relation to their living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For instance, cars are a means of transportation; they do not need to be high-class or expensive; as long as they serve the purpose of providing us transportation, it is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a car valued at thirty thousand dollars is more than sufficient for our use, why do we want to buy a car that is worth a hundred thousand dollars and for which we must work hard to come up with a way to earn the one hundred thousand dollars?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we do this, whatever we earn will eventually be spent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some people buy a new car every year; in the end, in order to buy a new car every year, they must work to the point of exhaustion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This also applies to the purchase of houses and clothing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In principle, we should always exercise moderation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we blindly pursue and are particular in our taste regarding these items, we will continually fall into a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should practice being frugal and thrifty for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May the Lord cover me with His blood; the suit I am wearing today was made in 1968, the year of our first international conference.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I have been wearing this suit for twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It still looks quite new and does not look like it is twenty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My wife always wants me to buy another suit, but I think this suit is good enough and ask for her forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If our Lord is false and if our service is merely a secondary occupation, then nothing matters.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if our Lord is real and the words in the Bible are also real, we need to consider how we will face the true and living Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Bible says that one day our Lord will come and settle an account with us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 25 He told a parable of a master who delivered his possessions to his slaves: To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one v. 15 . But the story does not end here; it does not end with the master delivering his possessions to his slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, one day, this master returned: Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them v. 19 . In this verse it is not merely a matter of rendering accounts but a matter of settling accounts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord will come back to settle accounts with us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How shall we settle our account?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is extremely crucial for us to realize.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For this reason, we repeatedly stress that if the Lord is real, we need to consider whether He is the one who leads us to pursue all the things related to our career, such as promotions, salary raises, and benefits.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the Lord has led us to do so, we will be able to settle our account to Him when we stand before His judgment seat in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will be able to tell Him, Lord, You led me to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if we will not be able to say this to the Lord, we need to carefully consider the extent to which we should spend our time and energy laboring on our job.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to set a limit and exercise restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Likewise, we should exercise moderation in the matter of our children s studies and in many other things related to our living.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This does not mean that we should not care for our living, our family, or our children s education, all of which are proper things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should live properly and take care of our children s education properly, but in everything we need to exercise restraint and set a limit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Worldly pleasures are endless, and they are snares to entrap us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, as long as we have enough to support ourselves, we should exercise restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Bible says explicitly, Having food and covering, with these we will be content 1 Tim 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, as long as we have food to sustain our life and clothes to cover our bodies, we should be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not here to serve mammon or our stomach; rather, we serve the true and living Lord because He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We will meet Him one day; hence, today we all need to seek His will and ask Him, Lord, to what extent do You want me to work?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Lord, as an elder in the church, I need to take care of Your church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all need to have this kind of transaction with the Lord.</S>
