   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Main Points of the Gospel of John</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first main section of the Gospel of John is divided into five sub-sections: first, "Introduction to life and building" ch.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 ; second, "Life's principle and life's purpose" 2:1-22 ; third, "Life meeting the need of man's every case" 2:23 11:57 ; fourth, "Life's issue and multiplication" ch.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>12 ; and fifth, "Life's washing in love to maintain fellowship" ch.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second main section, consisting of eight chapters, is "Jesus crucified and Christ resurrected going to prepare the way to bring man into God, and as the Spirit coming to abide and live in the believers for the building of God's habitation."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This main section is divided into four sub-sections: first, "Life's indwelling for the building of God's habitation" 14:1 16:33 ; second, "Life's prayer" ch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>17 ; third, "Life's process through death and resurrection for multiplication" 18:1 20:13, 17 ; and fourth, "Life in resurrection" 20:14 21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The sub-points in the outline are concise explanations, while the small items are detailed descriptions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, the third sub-section of the second main section is "Life's process through death and resurrection for multiplication," which is covered in 18:1 20:13, 17.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These two and a half chapters, in brief, are concerning the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They can also be divided up in a detailed way into the following points: first, He was betrayed; second, He was arrested; third, He was judged; fourth, He was crucified; fifth, He was buried; and sixth, He was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the process that He went through from His betrayal to His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He passed through this process for multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE MYSTERY OF THE DIVINE TRINITY IN JOHN 14</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In these three chapters John 14, 15, and 16 the most important portion is 14:7-20.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before we present the main points of this section, however, we must firstly have a general knowledge about its position in the book.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Chapter fourteen is included under the first sub-section of the second main section.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition, this sub-section is further divided into three small sections.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first small section, which comprises all of chapter fourteen, is on "The dispensing of the Triune God for the producing of His abode."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This small section is further divided into four small points.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second point is "The Triune God dispensing Himself into the believers," and comprises verses 7 though 20.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the point that we will cover.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This small point is divided into two smaller points: first, "The Father embodied in the Son seen among the believers" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>7-14 ; and second, "The Son realized as the Spirit to abide in the believers" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>15-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 14:7 the Lord told the disciples, "If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After hearing this word, Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us" v. 8 . Philip was somewhat puzzled by the Lord's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although he probably thought it was quite meaningful when he first heard it, he did not understand its real meaning; so he responded wrongly, asking the Lord to show them the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What the Lord meant when He said this to the disciples was that the disciples had seen the Father since they had already seen the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Philip, however, felt that although they had been seeing the Lord for such a long time, they had not yet seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They heard the Lord telling them to see, but in fact, they did not see anything. therefore, out of ignorance he said that if the Lord would show them the Father, they would be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Philip is actually a picture of us, and each one of us is a Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not only the brothers are Philips, but the sisters are also Philips.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whoever speaks nonsensical words, words without any revelation, is a Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today nearly all of Christianity is a Philip: the Catholic Church is a Philip, and the Protestant churches are also Philips.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The so-called fundamentalists are Philips, the Pentecostalists are Philips, and, even more, the modernists are Philips even evil Philips .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Whoever preaches the word without knowing the mystery of the Divine Trinity is speaking nonsense and is therefore a Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today nearly all of the preaching by Christianity is totally off-track and is far away from the central subject the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anyone who does not base his speaking upon the revelation of the Divine Trinity speaks nonsense and is a Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even when we are preaching the truth concerning justification by faith or concerning redemption through the precious blood, we must not preach these truths apart from the mystery of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Bible teachers all know that the New Testament contains the four Gospels, which speak about four aspects of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is so that an accurate picture will be presented.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Similarly, if you want to make a bronze statue of someone, you have to take four pictures of him so that you can have the basis to create the statue accurately, or else it may not look so real.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the beginning of the New Testament are the four Gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Most people agree that Matthew is on the Lord Jesus being the King, Mark is on the Lord Jesus being a slave, and Luke is on the Lord Jesus being a man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Concerning John, however, not many people have the boldness to say that it is on the Lord Jesus being God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not have adequate revelation and knowledge concerning the mystery of the Divine Trinity unveiled in the Gospel of John, we surely will not have the boldness and confidence to say this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need particular knowledge concerning the mysterious Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let me use language as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Chinese, some words are very close in pronunciation, and such words must be pronounced very carefully to avoid being misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have been speaking Shantung Mandarin since my youth, so my pronunciation of standard Mandarin is usually not so precise.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For example, my last name is "Lee," and Sister Lee's maiden name is "Li."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When I say these two words, others often cannot make a clear distinction between "Lee" and "Li" because the pronunciation of these two words is so similar.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because of this, whenever someone asks me, "What is your wife's maiden name?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I always hesitate and do not have the boldness to say it because I am not sure if I will pronounce it correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the same way, if we do not have a deep and thorough understanding of the words of mystery in the Gospel of John concerning the Triune God, we surely will not have the boldness to speak them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In actuality, the mystery in the four Gospels is the same as the mystery in the Gospel of John, and the mystery in John is the Triune God.</S>
