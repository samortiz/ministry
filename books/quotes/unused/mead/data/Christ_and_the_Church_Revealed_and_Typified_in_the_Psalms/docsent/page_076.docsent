   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SONGS OF ASCENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalms 120 through 134 are called the Psalms of degree, or the songs of ascent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that they are the Psalms of ascension, the Psalms of going up.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus we have the word in Psalm 122:4, "Whither the tribes go up."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In all these Psalms the house and the city of God are the center.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let us begin with Psalm 122.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I cannot express how much I love this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"I rejoiced when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord" v. 1 . This verse obviously refers to the house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But verse 2 continues by saying, "Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This then is the city.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Psalm opens with the house, but then proceeds immediately to the city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To enter into the house of the Lord is an exceedingly joyful experience; we may well rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And how good it is to stand within the gates of Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Oh, the house and the city!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The saints love the city and are glad to go into the house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not have such a Psalm as Psalm 122 in Book II.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We do have Psalms 46 and 48 in Book II; they are climactic Psalms concerning the city.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But those Psalms are not so sweet as this one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How sweet Psalm 122 is!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I enjoy it immensely.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 3 continues: "Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jerusalem is solidly built; far from being loose, it is compacted together solid, firm and safe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the city of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then verse 4: "Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This verse speaks of the ascent of the Israelites unto Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jerusalem was built upon Mount Zion, at least three thousand feet above sea level.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, whenever the people journeyed to Jerusalem, they must go up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And while they were going up, they sang this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verses 5 and 6: "For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is so clear: whoever loves Jerusalem will prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Remember that this is poetry, and we must understand it in a poetic way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whoever loves the Lord's church as a city will prosper.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 7: "Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The local churches are the palaces.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Peace is within their walls for safety, and prosperity is within these palaces for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The peace is for safety, and the prosperity is for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The peace is within the walls, and the prosperity is within the palaces, and both are within the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verses 8 and 9: "For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why did the Psalmist love the city?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because the house is there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because of the house he seeks the good of the city.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we have the city with the house, and the house with the city.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Praise the Lord, this is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now let us come to Psalm 125.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever" v. 1 . Zion is immovable; it abides for ever.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then what about Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Zion is safe, and Jerusalem is surrounded by mountains, which means that it is surrounded by God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What more can we say concerning the house and the city in Book V, since so many aspects have already been covered in Book I, Book II, III, and IV?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Psalmist adds this further aspect Zion is safe, and Jerusalem is surrounded by God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is the city for the house; this is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is God's house, where we enjoy the presence of God; and this is God's city, where we have the dominion of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Praise Him!</S>
