   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LANGUAGE PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need the Chinese-speaking meeting because a number of the immigrants who are the relatives and the parents of the young graduates do not know much English.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They may be able to speak enough English to get by in their business, but they have a real problem listening to a message in a Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They also have a hard time listening to the testimonies and they cannot praise or pray, uttering their feelings to the Lord freely.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because of this situation, these Chinese Christians have suffered greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result, they went somewhere else to a Chinese meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some of their children are coming to our meetings, but they will not come because they cannot understand anything.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are forced to go to other's Chinese Christian meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This shows us that there is the need of meeting the problem of this language barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition to this, even the younger generation who graduated from the schools in the United States still have a problem with the language.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They also can function with the English language adequately in their business or in their school, but it is difficult for them to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is also difficult for them to utter something in prayer or in praise.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because they feel awkward, this becomes a frustration to them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once a Chinese-speaking meeting begins, they immediately become happy and released.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even the ones who graduated from the universities in the United States are really happy and feel released.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They can utter everything in their prayer, praise, and testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some of the English-speaking saints who have come to the Chinese-speaking conferences and who have had to use the earphones for translation, have learned to sympathize with the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They know what a suffering it is to wear the earphones and now they understand more of the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These English-speaking saints testified that they are now qualified to sympathize with so many Chinese who must wear the earphones in the meeting for translation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is really a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Again, we can see that the need is here.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>CHINESE-SPEAKING MEETINGS NOT CHINESE CHURCHES</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must realize that we are not setting up Chinese churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These Chinese-speaking meetings are a part of the local church and these meetings are still under the one eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is absolutely a part of the local church and not an independent church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In some places the saints may feel awkward concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They may feel that this would begin to make the church in their locality Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Also, some of the saints may not be happy to see that in one building a Chinese-speaking Lord's table is going on upstairs and an English-speaking Lord's table is going on downstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They may not understand how one church can have two kinds of Lord's tables at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This may become a bothering to certain saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders should do their best to make this situation understandable to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is entirely for the Lord's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the churches can testify that the Chinese-speaking saints have really been a strengthening to the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Chinese-speaking meeting has always been a positive thing and a strengthening to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not only a help to the Chinese-speaking side of the church but also an indirect help to the English-speaking side of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a plus to the church in the increase, in the financial support, and in the functioning of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This has been and still is a real help to the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps it would be better to have a joint Lord's table once a month in a locality for the English-speaking saints and for the Chinese-speaking saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, at least once a month all would come together in order to keep a "mingled" atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This may also be quite profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we use the term "Chinese-speaking meeting," we stress the word speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not consider that it is a Chinese meeting, which is based upon the race.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This meeting is based upon the language.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have made it clear that anyone who can manage the English language for the purpose of the meeting must go to the English-speaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Chinese-speaking meeting does not depend upon race but upon your language.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If anyone can manage the Chinese language, he is free to come to the Chinese-speaking meeting.</S>
