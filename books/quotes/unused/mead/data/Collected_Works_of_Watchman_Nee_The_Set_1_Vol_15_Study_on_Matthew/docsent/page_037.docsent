   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER TWELVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the chronological sequence, the incidents in chapter twelve concerning the disciples' picking ears of grain and concerning the Lord's healing the man with a withered hand took place prior to chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why then in this book are they placed after chapter eleven?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is to show us how the Lord was rejected, so that the book can continue on to chapter thirteen.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Matthew's stress is on doctrines; hence, he put together the events that are of the same nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of the Ten Commandments, nine are moral in nature, and only one is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If the only one that is positive, that is, the one concerning the keeping of the Sabbath, is put aside, then it is a matter related to dispensation, indicating that the dispensation for Israel is over.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament the Sabbath has a threefold significance: 1 Keeping the Sabbath is for the remembrance of God's rest.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2 The Sabbath is a sign of the covenant God made with the children of Israel Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>3 Keeping the Sabbath is for the remembrance of the redemption of the children of Israel Deut 5:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the Jewish people pay special attention to the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They consider the Sabbath as the sign of God's covenant with them and also as a remembrance of God's rest and God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the keeping of the Sabbath is shaken, it is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the Jews' point of view, it is all right to pick ears of grain, but one must pay attention to the time when he does it, since no work is allowed on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, in verse 7 the Lord said that the disciples were guiltless in working on the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To pick ears of grain is to work, and to work on the Sabbath is to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since the disciples picked ears of grain on the Sabbath, they trespassed against the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, they sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, Christ said that although they trespassed against the Sabbath, they were guiltless.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From then on, all those who trespassed against the Sabbath were guiltless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The section on the healing of the man with a withered hand is a defense to show that the healing was not in violation of the Sabbath; likewise, the section on the disciples' picking ears of grain is a defense showing that the disciples' violation of the Sabbath was not a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ did not say that it was excusable to eat because of hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What He meant was that no exceptions would be permitted with regard to the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If the Sabbath should be kept, then all should keep it; if the Sabbath should not be kept, then none should keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Did Christ say that it was all right for David to eat the bread of the presence because he was hungry?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If so, this would be very serious, for it would be a putting aside of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Certainly Christ could not endorse this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What, then, did Christ say here?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ hinted in this section that what formerly could be eaten only by the priests could now also be eaten by the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was a dispensational change.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the Old Testament, there were three different ages in God's dealings with the children of Israel: first through the priests, then through the kings, and last through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>David represented the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although he was anointed by God, at that time he was rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God carried out His dealings with Israel through David.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, the priests were altogether put aside.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From 1 Samuel 2:35-36 we see that from then on, the priest had to walk before the king whom God had anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The kings ranked first and the priests ranked second.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Numbers 27:21-22 indicates that, formerly, persons in the political realm, such as Joshua, had to stand before the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That was the age of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>David's eating of the bread of the presence was the putting aside of the priests and the things pertaining to the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was not done as an exception to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, David was guiltless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>David could eat not only on that day; he could eat even every day.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The person was changed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When David ate the bread of the presence, it was at the time when he was being rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Matthew 12, when the disciples picked ears of grain, it was also an indication of the Lord's being rejected.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said that David and those who were with him ate vv.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, the Lord also brought the disciples in.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Verses 1-4:The Lord told us what kind of person He was.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verses 3-4 show us how the king's violating of the Sabbath was an indication that the dispensation had changed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 5:"Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless?"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The word "or" indicates that this is another section.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How did the priests profane the Sabbath?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They offered sacrifices on the Sabbath many more times than on ordinary days.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They did not profane the Sabbath at home but in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They committed the sin of offering too many sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Sacrifices are offered because of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Where sin is, there is no rest; where sin is, the covenant is over; where sin is, there is no remembrance of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The priests' offering of sacrifices was to solve the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Where sin is, there lies the root of having no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, the priests were considered guiltless in their profaning of the Sabbath in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This verse says that the priests also profaned the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The temple is for God and for God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The temple is the place that is filled with God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The sacrifices are for man's benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The priests violated the Sabbath for God's glory and man's benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, when the Lord came as the priest, He did not care for the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because there were sins in the tents of the Israelites, the priests could not rest in the temple, and thus they could not help offering sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only the offering of sacrifices could keep the children of Israel from the judgment of sin and also keep God's glory from suffering loss.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because God could not tolerate sin, there had to be the shedding of blood.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If the people had not sinned, the priests not only could have rest on one day, but they could have rest every day.</S>
