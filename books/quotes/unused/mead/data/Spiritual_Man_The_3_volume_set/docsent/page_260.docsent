   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>This kind of teaching is scriptural because the Bible says, "Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is,"..."proving what is well pleasing to the Lord" Eph 5:17, 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The function of the mind cannot be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God does not negate the faculty of man's soul; rather, He renews and uses it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God wants believers to know what they are doing when they obey Him; He does not want to have senseless and blind obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God does not want believers to be muddle-headed about what they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He does not want them to hear or feel something, presume that they are clear about God's will, and then act accordingly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither does God want to directly manipulate any believer just to make him ignorantly obey in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God wants the believer to understand His will and consciously exercise himself to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A lazy person does not want to bear any responsibility for himself; he just wants to passively allow God to use him or his members.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But God wants man to actively seek His will and exercise his own will and himself to obey Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God wants man's intuition to agree with his consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, believers do not realize that this is the right track of God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They allow themselves to sink into passivity, hoping that God will put His will into their minds.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They may receive some supernatural leading and may follow blindly without examining with their minds whether this leading is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They may mindlessly exercise their members and, without a clear understanding of God's will, hope that God would somehow use their members without their conscious effort.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The result of this behavior is demon-possession.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The condition for demon-possession is passivity in man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We will speak of this in detail elsewhere.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When man does not use his own mind, God will not use his mind either, because doing so would contradict the principle of God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The result is that evil spirits will seize the opportunity to take over the believer's mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Countless numbers of believers do not know that there are evil spirits in the world and that these evil spirits are doing their utmost to deceive God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If believers fulfill the condition for evil spirits to work, they will work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Moreover, they are everywhere scouting and looking for an opportunity to come in to take over the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, it is a very foolish thing to allow the mind to sink into passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is another matter that we should know about: the condition for evil spirits to work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have already spoken briefly about passivity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, we must go on to investigate it one step further.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this world there are some people who are very interested in fellowship with evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>No ordinary man would want to be possessed by demons, but these people are willing to be possessed by demons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are the necromancers, planchettes, mediums, and typtologists ones who "bring down" spirits .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we consider carefully the reason for their being demon-possessed, we can understand the principle of all demon-possession because all demon-possessions follow the same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These people tell us that in order to be possessed by a demon, which they call a god, their will must be completely void of resistance.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that they must be willing to accept anything that comes to their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, in order for their will to be passive, their mind must be empty and completely functionless, for only emptiness of the mind produces passivity of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two things are the basic conditions for being possessed by the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why a typtologist has to shake his head and dishevel his hair, and continue doing this for a long time until he becomes completely numbed in his head.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only then can he be possessed by a so-called god, and only then can the evil spirit operate.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the head is this empty, the will naturally loses all its functions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When this state is reached, little by little, the mouth no longer moves according to the person's own will, and the whole body begins to shiver.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Soon after, the "god" comes to his body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>With those who communicate with demons, the methods by which they become possessed may be different in outward respects.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, upon examining the principle, we can find that the methods are all done through the mind becoming empty and the will becoming passive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One thing is certain: if you ask these people, they will surely tell you that when demons come, their mind cannot think of course, if the will could become passive without the mind becoming empty, the mind would still think , and their will cannot function.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, they must attain to a state of emptiness in the mind and passivity in the will before the demons will come.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Otherwise, they will not come.</S>
