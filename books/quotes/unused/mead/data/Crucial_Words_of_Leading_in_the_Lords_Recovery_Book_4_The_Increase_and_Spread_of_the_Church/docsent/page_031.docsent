   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Everyone Functioning and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Bearing the Responsibility Faithfully</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The arrangement of the small groups allows everyone to function according to his or her measure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A small group gathering removes every excuse for not functioning.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every small group gathering is a playground for playing ball.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As long as there is a playground, no one has an excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past some may have felt that there was no place to exercise their function.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But now one huge playground has become four hundred small playgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are small playgrounds near every saint.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no excuse for not playing, but when we play, we should neither overvalue or depreciate our function.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The most important thing is that everyone function and bear responsibility faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Exercising Wisdom and Learning Actively</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I would like to speak of my personal experience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>During the first three weeks in August of 1933, there was a tremendous struggle within me concerning whether I should drop my job to serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During this time, Brother Watchman Nee was sailing back from Europe to China.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day while he was praying in his cabin for the work in China, the Lord gave him a sense to write a letter, telling me that I should serve the Lord full time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He sent this letter to the Shanghai Gospel Bookroom, which redirected the letter to me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My decision was a source of great consternation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At this time I had three children, and even though it did not matter to me whether I starved, I had the responsibility for my wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then I received Brother Nee s letter in which he said, Brother Witness, as for your future, I feel that you should serve the Lord with your full time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>How do you feel?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>May the Lord lead you.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although the note was short, I was deeply touched.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Subsequently, I let go of my job to serve the Lord full time and went to Shanghai in October to see Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The co-workers in Shanghai also confirmed my decision to serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I arrived in Shanghai, everyone I met spoke the Shanghai dialect, whereas I spoke the native dialect of Chefoo in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, the co-workers encouraged me to move my family to Shanghai so that I could serve in coordination with them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later a brother said to me, Brother Lee, you are a native of Chefoo, but you are able to come to Shanghai to preach and even work among the Shanghainese.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later I came to work in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I began to give messages, I heard comments that no Chinese preachers had been able to work among Americans except for me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even though my English was not very good, I was asked about my secret for speaking to Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The only secret is to endeavor to learn the particular ways of others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our learning, we will gain an understanding of their ways that even they may not fully realize.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, after I arrived in Shanghai, I did not learn much of the Shanghai dialect, but I learned the ways of the Shanghainese.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, I could speak convincingly with clear messages that touched the feeling of the Shanghainese.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the end of May 1961, I began to give messages in English in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After speaking for three years, the Americans said, All those in the church life in the United States speak Mr. Lee s English.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today some American Christian publications also adopt my expressions, such as returning to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1964 the Los Angeles Times published a report about us that was not very accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We responded by writing an article to state our standing, and I used the term church practice, realizing that there was no such expression in English.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>An American brother who taught English said, This is not good English.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I replied, You are right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I know this is not good English, but please tell me what other English words convey this meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He thought for a long time but was unable to think of anything; in the end he had to agree with the expression I used.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not long after that, we published The Stream magazine as well as an English hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this hymnal I wrote nearly two hundred hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There was an American brother who knew music quite well, and he was also very good in poetry.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Consequently, he felt that some of my expressions were not very good English.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Based on his word, I handed the hymns to him to make corrections.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He spent a good amount of time on them, yet he also felt that it was difficult to make corrections.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the end he used many of the original words.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then I told him that literature follows culture.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When there is a certain invention in a culture, there will be the need for a new word; that is, there will be the need for an expression to convey the culture s progress.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When there are no appropriate words, a word needs to be created.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I have had to create new terms because there were no words to express these new developments.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the past there was not such a thing in Christianity as returning to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Returning to the spirit speaks of a new culture; it is a new expression created by us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Several years ago in an institutional publication of a renowned American evangelist, there was an article that even used the term pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows that Christianity also sees a need for new terms.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hence, we should not be conservative; rather, we should endeavor to learn in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the secret of my work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All of us need to learn well.</S>
