   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN GOD S INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FULFILLED IN TRANSFORMATION Scripture Reading: Gen 2:8-12; 1 Cor 3:9, 12; John 1:42; Heb 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18; Rev 22:1-2; 21:18-21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As we have seen, the tree of life is the central subject, the central thought, of the entire Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the beginning God created the universe and He created man as a vessel to contain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man was made as a container in order to have God as his contents.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, after God created man, He put man in front of the tree of life, which signifies the Triune God to be our life, our enjoyment, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God presented Himself to man as man s enjoyment that man may take Him in. By man s eating of the tree of life, the very Triune God could come into man and mingle Himself with man to make Himself one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Corinthians 6:17 tells us that we human beings can be joined to the Lord as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can be one spirit with the Creator, with God Himself!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God presented Himself as enjoyment to man but man fell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Thus, God changed His form from the tree of life to a redeeming Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the redeeming Lamb, God presented Himself to fallen man as life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through the redeeming Lamb, fallen man could be brought back to enjoy God as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our second birth, the birth in our spirit John 3:6 , brought God Himself into us as our very life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After our birth we continue to enjoy Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, as our food, our drink, our air, and even as our abode, our dwelling place, day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, Christ becomes everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>ENJOYING THE LORD AS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE FLOW OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>TO BE TRANSFORMED INTO THE IMAGE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The tree of life signifies God in the Son as the Spirit to be our life and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Genesis 2 records that God placed man in front of the tree of life and that this man was a vessel of clay vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A river went out of Eden to water the garden, and this river was divided into four heads v. 10 . The issue of the flow of this river was gold, bdellium a kind of pearl , and onyx stone v. 12 . We need to look to the Lord that He would give us a heavenly, spiritual view of this picture presented to us in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We all need to be transformed from men of clay, vessels of clay, into precious materials for God s building gold, bdellium, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are going to be transformed from clay into precious material for God s building, we have to eat the fruit of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we eat the fruit of the tree of life, this life becomes the pure, heavenly, living, and spiritual water flowing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This flow of life will transform the clay into gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All these precious materials are for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The conclusion of the divine revelation shows us a city built of gold, pearls, and precious stones Rev 21:19-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we enjoy the Lord as the tree of life, this life flows within us and transforms us into the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>GROWING IN LIFE FOR GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Apostle Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 3 that we are God s farm, God s building v. 9 . The building of God s temple, God s dwelling place, is only possible by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is why the farm is mentioned first and then the building.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The growth of life makes the building possible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Paul tells us that the apostles are God s fellow-workers, God s co-workers, who labor on God s farm to plant and to water.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>On the one hand, the apostles are the farmers, the husbandmen, and on the other hand, they are the builders.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The planting and the watering are so that we may grow in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Out of this growth we become the proper materials for the building up of the church, which are gold, silver, and precious stones 1 Cor 3:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In Genesis the second material is pearl while in 1 Corinthians it is silver.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Apostle Paul mentions silver instead of pearl because in Genesis 2 sin had not entered yet and there was no need of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Silver signifies the redeeming Christ with all the virtues and attributes of His person and work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Paul wrote 1 Corinthians 3 there was the real need of silver, the redeeming Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>HOW WE CAN BE TRANSFORMED</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>INTO PRECIOUS MATERIALS FOR GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we need to go on to see how human beings of clay can be transformed into gold, silver, and precious stones for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Peter was originally a man of clay named Simon.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When he was brought to the Lord for the first time the Lord changed his name to Peter, which means a stone John 1:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Genesis 2 indicates that man was made from the dust of the ground, but the Lord called Simon a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord changed Simon s name to Peter because when Peter began to know the Lord as the Son of God, as the living Christ, Peter had received the Lord into him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At that time a metabolic change took place within Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When Christ as the divine life is added into us some spiritual chemistry takes place and there is a metabolic change in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The clay is changed into a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eventually, this stone will be transformed into precious stone, transparent and shining.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the church we can have the heavenly, spiritual gold, silver, and precious stones by Christ as life transforming us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more that we enjoy Christ, the more that we take Him in by eating Him, drinking Him, and breathing Him in, the more His life will transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Christian life is not a matter of outward correction or adjustment but a matter of transformation, of a metabolic change in our inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When I was a young Christian, I received a number of teachings concerning holiness and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Brethren teaching tells us that sanctification is something positional.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They point out the Lord Jesus word in Matthew 23 to the Pharisees that it is the temple which sanctifies the gold v. 17 and the altar which sanctifies the gift v. 19 . This makes the gold holy positionally by changing its position from a common place to a holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They also point out that the common food that we buy becomes sanctified through the word of God and our prayer 1 Tim 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This sanctification is positional.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Another school stresses holiness as an eradication of the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must realize that the real holiness, the real sanctification, is not something merely positional nor is it an eradication of our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sanctification is not only a matter of position but also a matter of disposition, that is, a matter of being transformed from the natural disposition into a spiritual one.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sanctification is to work God s holiness into us by having God s divine nature imparted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this sanctification, Christ, as the life-giving Spirit, is saturating all the inward parts of our being with God s divine nature for our transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There may be a certain sister in the Lord who loves the Lord very much, yet in her character, her disposition, there is the problem of a bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>She may be helped to realize that she has been positionally sanctified, that her position has changed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Formerly she was in Adam and now she is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>She exercises to take this standing with the realization that she has been transferred out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Because she is in Christ, she must be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But eventually this dear sister will discover that it does not work just to have the realization that she is positionally sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even though she realizes that she is in Christ, this does not stop her from losing her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Other Christians believe that sanctification is the eradication of our sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There was a preacher in Shanghai many years ago who taught strongly the concept of eradication.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He told people that they could not sin after they were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>One day, this preacher and several young men who were under his teaching went to the city park in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>That park required the proof of a ticket in order to be admitted.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This man bought three or four tickets to be used by a total of five persons.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>How did he do this?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>First some of them entered the park with the tickets.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then one of them came out with the tickets and gave a ticket to one of the others.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This continued until all five men had entered the park.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In this sinful way that preacher brought his four young disciples through the gate of the park.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As a result of this, one of the young men began to doubt the teaching of eradication.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He said within himself, What are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You say that sin has been eradicated from you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Eventually the young man went to the preacher and said, Was that not a sin?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The preacher replied, No, that was not a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>That was just a little weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The leader of this group who proclaimed that his sinful nature had been eradicated was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We should never accept a teaching that says that we have become so spiritual and holy that it is impossible for us to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If we accept such a doctrine, we will be deceived, and the result will be misery.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now that we have received Christ into us, we have to enjoy Him in the spirit day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We have to eat Him, drink Him, and breathe Him in. This living Christ within us will transform us and sanctify us in our disposition through our enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>For us to merely stand on the fact that we have been positionally sanctified and then endeavor to do something to stand against the sinful nature within us does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>We need to realize that the living, life-giving Spirit, Christ as life, is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Now we need to open ourselves to Him day by day and even hour by hour.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We need to eat Him, drink Him, breathe Him, and abide in Him to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Then He will transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This transformation is not an outward correction or adjustment.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>By enjoying Christ as life and by being filled with Him as life, His life swallows up all the negative things in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>His life will swallow up our bad temper.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>His life will transform the clay vessels into gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Do not try to overcome your temper by your own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Your temper is too big for you to overcome by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Do not deal with your temper but deal with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Eat of Him as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Rest under His shadow and enjoy His fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The life of Christ is living and powerful and can swallow up all the death and negative things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>He will not only correct us, adjust us, deliver us, and save us, but He will transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We need to forget about our temper, our weaknesses, our problems, and our troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We need to take our eyes away from all these things and look to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Look away from everything unto Jesus Heb 12:2 , and set your mind upon Him Rom 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Feast on Him, drink Him, breathe Him in, abide in Him, praise Him, adore Him, and behold Him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We need to be like a mirror beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>When we behold the Lord in this way, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Thus, we are being metabolically transformed into His image and all the negative things within our being are swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>To enjoy the Lord is the way of salvation, sanctification, and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>The more we are sanctified, the more we will be transformed and the more holy we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Our holiness will not just be a change in position but a change in our very nature.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>When we are being transformed, we are in resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We are in a transcendent condition and all things are under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Teaching people to correct themselves, to adjust themselves, or to improve themselves is not the right way, the heavenly way, or the divine way.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>The divine way is not self-correction, self-adjustment, or self-improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>God s way is to put Christ into us for us to enjoy Him by eating Him, drinking Him, breathing Him in, abiding in Him, and letting Him be everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>He is living and powerful, and He will transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Transformation is much better than outward correction, adjustment, or improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Transformation is a heavenly, spiritual, divine metabolic change in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The Lord is transforming us from one degree of glory to another degree of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We are being changed from clay to gold, pearl, and precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The way of transformation is to enjoy the Lord, to feast on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Transformation is a feast, an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>All of us are like Mephibosheth, the grandson of King Saul 2 Sam 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Mephibosheth was lame; he was unable to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>King David preserved his life, restored to him all his inheritance, and invited him to feast with him at the same table 2 Sam 9:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>After Mephibosheth received grace from David, he only looked at the riches on David s table; he did not look at his two lame legs underneath the table.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Whenever we look at ourselves, we discover that we are lame and we become discouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>After we have been saved, we should forget about our two lame legs, and sit at the table of our King, Jesus Christ, to enjoy Him with all His unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We should only look at the riches on the Lord s table and enjoy them.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>By our enjoyment of the unsearchably rich Christ, He will transform us.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>GOD S ULTIMATE INTENTION FULFILLED</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>BY THE ENJOYMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>AS THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>The precious materials at the flow of the river in Genesis 2 are for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>At the end of the divine revelation there are the tree of life, the river of water of life, and the precious materials built up as a holy city, the New Jerusalem Rev 22:1-2; 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>This city is the counterpart of Christ and the dwelling place of God for God to rest in. As the counterpart of Christ, the holy city satisfies Christ, and as the dwelling place of God, the holy city satisfies God.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The beginning of the Scriptures shows us the tree of life with a flowing river issuing in precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>At the end of the Scriptures there is a universal city built up with these precious materials with the tree of life growing in it and the river of life flowing in it.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>This shows that God s eternal purpose, His ultimate intention, is to have a divine building built by the tree of life with the flow of the river of water of life to produce the precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>According to God s ultimate and eternal intention we have to be transformed and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Transformation is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>How spiritual we are depends on how much we have been transformed and how much we have been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>The book of Romans provides a sketch of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>This book begins with justification by faith 3:21 5:11 and continues with sanctification 5:12 8:13 , transformation 12:1 15:13 , conformation, and glorification 8:14-39 for the Body life 12:1-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Through the Lord s redemption we are justified and brought back to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Now a transforming work is going on within us in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>We have to be sanctified, transformed, and conformed to the image of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>This is all for the Body of Christ, which is the building.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>Justification is for sanctification, sanctification is for transformation, and transformation is for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>We are transformed and thus conformed into the very image of Christ that we may be materials good for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>God s building is the expression of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>The New Jerusalem has the appearance of jasper Rev 21:11 and jasper is also the appearance of God 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>The city s wall and the first foundation of the city are built with jasper 21:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>This means that with the New Jerusalem there is the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>Furthermore, within the holy city is the throne of God and the Lamb 22:1 , which means that God s authority is exercised there.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Thus, God s purpose and intention are fulfilled by the enjoyment of the Triune God as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>I hope that we can bring this fellowship to the Lord in prayer so that this truth will be so living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Our need is to take Christ as our food, drink, air, and abode.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>Our need is to enjoy Him so that we may be transformed day by day and be built up together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>Then God s image will be expressed among us and through us, and His authority will be exercised among us over the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>Thus, God s intention will be fulfilled.</S>
