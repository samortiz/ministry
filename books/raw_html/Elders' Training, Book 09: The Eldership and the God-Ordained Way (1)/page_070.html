<P>In the past, our Lord's Day morning meetings were carried out in a routine way. Very few came to the meeting with a sincere heart, burdened for the meeting. Most did not bear the burden even to pray for the meeting because they knew the responsible brothers would. The situation in the eldership in some places in the past was not so encouraging either. Before a brother became an elder, he may have been sitting in the back in the meeting without much exercise. One day he was appointed to be an elder, and then he came to sit in the first row. During the meeting the need might have arisen for a hymn or for a word to be spoken. The elders all looked at one another, but no one could meet the need.</P><P>Most of the elders do not endeavor; instead, they do a routine work. If I were doing a routine work, I would not be able to travel so much in order to hold so many conferences, nor would I be able to publish so many books. My fellowship with you here concerns the destiny of the Lord's recovery. It is a matter of life or death. Do we really love the Lord? Are we really for Him and for His recovery? If we are, we have to forget about the routine work, and endeavor and labor to do something extra. Even as an older brother, I am still studying. The point is this: if there is no labor, no work, there is no result, no profit. People who desire to make a big profit in business do not waste their time. Anyone who works only eight hours a day cannot be wealthy. He can only make a living as an employee. Who among us is laboring for the Lord's recovery?</P><P>If we had been laboring, we would have studied the new way to carry out the increase and spread of the church. We would have practiced visiting people by knocking on their doors to find out about it and to break through in our increase. Spontaneously we would have set up a pattern for the other saints to follow. In the flock, the sheep taking the lead may be considered as the head sheep. The elders are the head sheep. When they go in a positive direction, the rest of the saints will follow them. In some places the elders did not do this. Instead of getting into preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes and practicing it to set up a living example, they restricted the saints from knocking on doors and poured cold water upon this practice. Some want to stop the saints from going out to knock on doors. They do not care for the fruit, the increase.</P>
