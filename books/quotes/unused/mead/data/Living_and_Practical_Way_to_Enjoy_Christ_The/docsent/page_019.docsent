   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX EATING AND DIGESTION Scripture Reading: John 6:57b, 63; 7:37-39a; Isa 55:1, 6; 1 Cor 12:13b; Rev 2:7, 17b; 3:20; 22:1-2a, 14a, 17 DRINKING AND EATING BY CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus far, we have seen that we are vessels of God and that God as the all-inclusive Spirit is the content to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The way for us to take Him in is to call upon His name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we want to see that calling upon Him is likened in the Bible to drinking and eating.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah 55:1 and 6 show that the way to drink and to eat is to call upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Isaiah 55:1 says, "Ho!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters,/And you who have no money;/Come, buy and eat;/Yes, come, buy wine and milk/Without money and without price."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse is somewhat complicated because it says we come to the waters and yet we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you come to the waters to eat or to drink?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Mothers feed their newborn babes with milk.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the little babes are drinking milk, they are also eating.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eating is included in drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We come to the waters and buy and eat.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then this verse says that we buy wine and milk.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both wine and milk are liquids, but the nourishment of food is included in them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, to drink wine and milk really means to eat something for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 6 says, "Seek Jehovah while He may be found;/Call upon Him while He is near."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This verse advises us to seek the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To seek the Lord means to come to the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord is the waters, and the seeking is the coming.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To drink and to eat is to call upon His name while He is near.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, seeking the Lord equals coming to the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Calling upon Him equals drinking and eating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the way that we take in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The spiritual things are often hard to define.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there are the shadows given by the Lord through the material things, the physical things, to illustrate the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>EATING JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have pointed out that we are vessels to contain the Lord, and the Lord is the content.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The vessels need to be filled up with this content.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are filled with the Lord as our content by eating and drinking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is an organic infilling, which causes the growth in life and the transformation in life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we receive the proper drink and food, something organic gets into us to cause us to grow and be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To put water into a cup is simply to fill it up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is not organic.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when we take something into our stomach by eating and drinking, we are not merely being filled up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By digestion what we eat is assimilated into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, after eating we need the digestion and assimilation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By digesting and assimilating what we eat and drink, we absorb all the nourishment into our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This nourishment, after getting into our blood, becomes our cells.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then after a certain time all the cells become our organic tissues, our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If I put water into a cup, it is just filled up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no digestion, assimilation, growth, or transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The water can never become the very element and essence of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is different with us human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can a turkey be put into a human vessel?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The only way is for this person to eat the turkey.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the turkey becomes this person's essence and element.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Jesus said, "He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" John 6:57b .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A person is full of energy because of what he has eaten.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We live by what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We eat Jesus, so we live by Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What we eat obviously gets inside of us to become our content.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then it is digested by us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>By being digested, the nourishment and the riches of what we eat are assimilated into our system to become our cells.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then the cells grow into our organic tissues to become us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thus, we are what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A man lives by what he eats and eventually he is what he eats.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we eat Jesus, eventually we are Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is why Paul said, "It is no longer I .. but it is Christ who lives in me" Gal 2:20a ; "for to me, to live is Christ" Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you eat turkey all the time, you could say, "For to me, to live is turkey."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You eat turkey, so you live by turkey and for you to live is turkey.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When we eat Jesus, we live by Jesus and we are Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For us to live is Jesus!</S>
