   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 1 DAY 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1 John 5:13 I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe into the name of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Rom 8:16 The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 John 3:14 We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He who does not love abides in death.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How can we have the assurance of salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are three means: Our first means of assurance of salvation is God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>While man's word may be untrustworthy, God's Word remains sure and steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is impossible for God to lie Heb 6:18; Num 23:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever God says stands firm forever Psa 119:89 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What God has said is not a matter of conjecture.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His Word is neither vague nor intangible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It comes to us today in written form, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Bible is God's very Word, inspired by Him 2 Tim 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can take this Word, believe this Word, and trust this Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>17</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Man acquires an inheritance by a testament a will .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The written words of the covenant in the Bible were left to us by the Lord as a testament Heb 9:15-16 , by which we may inherit the blessings of His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>18 What then does God say about salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He says that the way of salvation is a person, Jesus Christ John 3:16; 14:6; Acts 10:43; 16:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He says that whoever believes that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead and confesses with his mouth that Jesus is Lord is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He says that whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Rom 10:9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Have you done this?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Have you believed in Christ and confessed openly that He is your Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Have you called on His name?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If so, you are really saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God says so.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>That settles it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By the Spirit's Witnessing with Our Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Second , what the Bible speaks to us from without, the Spirit confirms within.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>First John 5:10 says, "He who believes into the Son of God has the testimony witness in himself."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>19 The assurance of our salvation is based on the Spirit's witnessing with our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everyone who believes in the Lord enjoys addressing God as "Abba, Father."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, every time we call Him "Abba, Father," we feel sweet and comfortable within.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is because we are children begotten of God, we have God's life, and the Spirit of God's Son has entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Concerning our father in the flesh, it is spontaneous and sweet for us to call him "Father."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, since we enjoy calling God "Abba, Father," and do it spontaneously, even with a sweet and comfortable sensation, this proves that we have God's life and are children begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, by the Spirit's inner witnessing with our spirit we can know with certainty that we are God's children and that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>20</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By Our Loving the Brothers</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Third , the assurance of salvation is based on the fact that we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First John 3:14 says, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since God is love 1 John 4:16 and since we have His life, we surely have the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, since we have been begotten of God, we certainly love those who have been begotten of Him 1 John 5:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a saved one sees a brother in the Lord, he has an affection for him and even loves him in such a manner that is incomprehensible to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, our love toward the brothers in the Lord is a proof by which we know that we have been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is a proof of our experience of life, which we may call the proof of love.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By our believing believing in the Lord we have life and have passed out of death into life; by our loving loving the brothers we know that we have life and that we have passed out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, by the clear words of the Bible, by the sensation in our spirit, and by the experience of love, we can know with certainty that we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>21</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
