   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF COLOSSIANS MESSAGE THIRTEEN COMPLETING THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: Col 1:25; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17; 13:14; Eph 3:14-19</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1:25 Paul says, Of which I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we shall consider the matter of completing the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE WORD OF GOD INCLUDING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>PREACHED BY THE EARLY DISCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At the time of Paul, the word of God included the Old Testament and the word preached by the early disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Acts 4:29 the disciples prayed that they might preach God s word with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Acts 4:31, they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Acts 6:4 we see that the apostles gave themselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Acts 6:7 tells us that the word of God increased.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Those who were scattered because of the persecution against the church following the death of Stephen went every where preaching the word Acts 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, Acts 12:24 says that the word of God grew and multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although the word of God preached by the early disciples grew and multiplied, it was not yet completed according to God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this completion, God s revelation to Paul was needed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the Jews have only the Old Testament, they do not have the complete oracle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, although Christians have both the Old Testament and the New Testament, in actuality many of them do not have the complete revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In their experience and in their understanding, they may have only the Gospels, Acts, and part of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many have studied the Bible, but still lack an adequate understanding of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to the stewardship of God, Paul became a minister of the church to complete the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Consider what a lack there would be if we did not have the Epistles of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without them, there would be no completion of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul s stewardship was to complete the word of God in order to dispense Christ with all His riches into the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The revelation given to Paul was for the completion of God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, it is crucial that we all know the revelation that was given to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GOD S REVELATION TO PAUL A. Christ Being the Mystery of God</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul received the revelation of Christ as the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In 2:2 he speaks of the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This term, the mystery of God, is not found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Gospels do not record any time that it was used by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was first used by Paul in his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The mystery of God is Christ as the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Colossians 2:9 says, For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As the mystery of God, Christ must be both the embodiment of God and the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All fundamental Christian teachers believe that Christ is the embodiment of God, but very few see that He is also the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In order for us to know Christ in reality as the embodiment of God, we need to experience Him as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because the enemy knows the crucial significance of this, he attacks this point intensely.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not realize that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, the fact that Christ is the embodiment of God is merely doctrine or theory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is just an objective teaching not at all related to our Christian experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If this is the situation, there is no way for theory to become reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The reality of Christ as the embodiment of God is in Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In John 14:16 through 18 the Lord Jesus said, And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, Whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The One who is the Spirit of reality in verse 17 becomes the very One who is the Lord Himself in verse 18; He becomes I. This indicates that after His resurrection the Lord became the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Corinthians 15:45, which deals with the matter of resurrection, confirms this by saying that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul was bold and not at all ambiguous in declaring the fact that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To the natural mind it is not logical that the last Adam, a man in the flesh, could become a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Nevertheless, Paul uncompromisingly declared this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Furthermore, in 2 Corinthians 3:17 he said, Now the Lord is that Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>According to the context of the whole chapter, the Spirit in verse 17 is the Spirit who gives life in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, in 2 Timothy 4:22 Paul clearly said, The Lord be with thy spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>How clear is Paul s word!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 1964 I was warned by an intimate friend not to teach that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This one admitted that the Bible teaches that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, because religious tradition makes others unwilling to accept this fact, he was not bold to declare it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I told my friend, If I do not teach that Christ is the life-giving Spirit, I have no ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I came to this country with the burden mainly to minister along this line.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Later that year I gave a series of messages on Christ as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These messages are printed in The Economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many of us can testify of the help we have received in life through realizing that our Lord today is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If Christ were not the Spirit in our spirit, how could we experience Him as our life?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We would have no experience of Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Instead, we would simply have another form of religious practice.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But because we have Christ as the life-giving Spirit, we do not have a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have the living Christ in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the one hand, He is the embodiment of the fullness of God and, on the other hand, He is the life-giving Spirit indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This revelation of Christ is part of the revelation given to Paul for the completion of the word of God.</S>
