[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE GOAL OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY BUILDING UP THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Eph 4:8-16 OUTLINE Building up the Body being different from building up a congregation: Building up a congregation being organizational.
[3]  Thank the Lord for giving us this conference in these two evenings.
[4]  In these two meetings, our burden is to help the brothers and sisters to see in a brief way the goal of God's ordained way and the way to practice it.
[5]  First of all, we need to know that the God-ordained way, which is the new way that we have been talking about in the past three years, is an ancient way in the Bible.
[6]  BUILDING UP THE ORGANIC BODY OF CHRIST Needing Christ as the Head
[7]  For the building up of the organic Body of Christ, firstly there is the need of Christ as the Head.
[8]  In order to have a body, you must first have a head; this head is Christ Himself.
[9]  For the sake of building up the organic body of Christ, all the perfected saints need to hold the truth in love, that is, to hold to the real things such as God, Christ, the Spirit, life, and the church, so that we can grow up into the Head, Christ.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE PRACTICAL STEPS OF GOD'S ORDAINED WAY Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1-3, 5-7; 19:5; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:26, 31, 1, 4b OUTLINE Preaching the gospel to gain people: By visiting people Luke 10:1-3, 5-7: Needing to pay a price.
[11]  We have already seen that the goal of the new way is to build up the Body of Christ.
[12]  Building up the Body of Christ is an organic function, not an organizational work.
[13]  This Bible-revealed, God-ordained new way that the Lord has shown us is to build up the organic Body of Christ through the organic functions.
[14]  In visiting people to preach the gospel to gain them for the Lord, we not only desire that people be saved, but also that they become the material for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[15]  In our preaching the gospel by visiting, we bring people to believe in the Lord and we baptize them; then they become new believers.
[16]  We still need to gradually bring the new believers from the group meetings to the district meetings to help them come further into the church life.
[17]  CHAPTER THREE THE DIVINE POWER OF GOD AND THE PRECIOUS PROMISES OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:3-11; 2 Cor 12:9; Matt 6:31-33; Phil 4:19 OUTLINE The divine power of God 2 Pet 1:3: Through our knowing the One who has called us through His own glory and virtue.
[18]  Having given to us all things which relate to life and godliness: Life being the inward divine supply with God as life.
[19]  This is a training message for the working brothers and sisters.
[20]  When I was seeking before the Lord on your behalf, I felt that if the working brothers and sisters are to be adequately and properly participating in the church life, they need to receive the life supply continuously.
[21]  GOD HAVING GRANTED TO US ALL THINGS RELATED TO LIFE AND GODLINESS
[22]  This is just like what the Bible shows us.
[23]  The divine power of God has granted unto us all things related to life and godliness.
[24]  THE LORD GRANTING TO US THE PRECIOUS AND EXCEEDINGLY GREAT PROMISES
[25]  If in our whole life we do not practice the church life, love the Lord, and serve the Lord, then not only is there a great effect on ourselves, our family, and our children, but the loss we will suffer is beyond estimation.
[26]  God has already granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that we may escape the corruption that is in the world by lust.
[27]  As long as we receive these promises of God, He can cause us to escape the corruption that is in the world by lust and to practice the church life in peace, enjoying Christ and being happy and joyful.
[28]  You should take the attitude that as long as there are clothes to wear and there is food to eat, you should be content and carry out your duty to practice the church life and enjoy Christ according to what you have learned and experienced.
[29]  CHAPTER FOUR THE MIRACULOUSLY NORMAL LIVING IN THE NEW WAY Scripture Reading: Heb 7:25; Phil 1:19; 4:13; Heb 3:12 OUTLINE Being revived every morning: Calling on the Lord and contacting the Lord immediately upon rising up in the morning.
[30]  Enjoying the Lord and absorbing the Lord's rich supply using a few verses.
[31]  In the New Testament, there is the thought that we can breathe God in. For example, in 2 Timothy 3:16 where the Apostle Paul was talking about the origin of the Bible, he said that the Bible is God-breathed.
[32]  This indicates that when we are reading God's Word, God is breathing out toward us; He breathes out and we breathe in. Not only so, but in both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the word for "spirit" in Hebrew and Greek has a three-fold meaning: spirit, wind, and breath.
[33]  When we come to John 20, after the Lord died and resurrected, He appeared to the disciples and breathed into them saying, "Receive the Holy Spirit" v. 22 . From this we can see that the Bible, from the Old Testament to the New, has the thought that God is breath to us.
[34]  The title of this chapter, "The Miraculously Normal Living in the New Way," is based on the divine revelation of the Bible that we may have a living that breathes in God.
[35]  We human beings can have God, not merely to be our outward help and support, but to enter into us to be our life and supply.
[36]  In the last chapter we saw that the divine power of God has granted to us all things related to life and godliness and has also granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises.
[37]  Rather, we need to calm down our desire and concern, so that we can escape the corruption that is in the world through lust and be partakers of the divine nature, to enjoy God Himself.
[38]  Through this we can save much money as well as time for prayer, fellowshipping with the Lord, enjoying the Lord in His Word, going out to preach the gospel to people by visiting them, and caring for the saints.
[39]  This kind of human life is normal yet miraculous because it is not something that we can live by ourselves, but God must enter into us to be our life in order for us to live out this kind of life.
[40]  CHAPTER FIVE THE FATHER'S STRENGTHENING AND CHRIST'S MAKING HOME Scripture Reading: Eph 3:14-21 OUTLINE The Father's strengthening v. 16: According to the riches of His glory.
[41]  The passage that we have read is the second of the two important prayers of the Apostle Paul in the book of Ephesians.
[42]  In the first prayer, Paul prayed for revelation for the saints that they might see the hope of God's calling, the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, the power of God toward us, and the church which God is after, which is the Body, the fullness of Christ 1:15-23 .
[43]  Without Paul's prayer, even though we have the Gospel of John and the fourteen Epistles of Paul, plus Peter's writings and John's other writings, we would still be unable to realize that our relationship with Christ is so intimate, that Christ is to be our content, and that He desires to make His home in every part of our being, making us His habitation to express Him.
[44]  If there were no God, no man could write a passage like Ephesians 4, because this chapter is too profound.
[45]  When our spirit becomes strong and prevails over our soul, we are being strengthened into the inner man.
[46]  Then Christ will be able to make His home in our hearts through faith.
[47]  When Christ makes His home in our hearts, and when we are strong to apprehend with all the saints the dimensions of Christ and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Him through our experience, we will be filled by the Triune God with all His virtues and attributes to become the fullness of God expressing all His riches.
[48]  CHAPTER SIX THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE WORKING SAINTS AND THE NEW WAY IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:13-17; Phil 1:19-21a; Eph 4:12, 16; 2 Tim 4:7-8, 18b OUTLINE God's need in His economy today: The young and the middle-aged saints 1 John 2:13-17: Those believers who are grown-up in God's life.
[49]  There are many things I want to say to you.
[50]  Continuing to Know This Eternal Christ by the Inner Life until Maturity
[51]  The Present Meetings and Services Creating Unlimited Opportunities for the Saints to Serve
[52]  The meetings and services in the past did not create enough opportunities for the saints to serve.
[53]  CHAPTER SEVEN GIVE UP THE WORLD CHRIST TO OBTAIN Scripture Reading: Heb 11:24-27; Phil 3:7-9a; 1 Cor 9:17; Eph 3:2; Col 1:25; Eph 2:20-22; 1 Cor 3:10; 2 Tim 4:7-8, 18a; 2 Cor 12:15a; Luke 16:9; 1 Thes 2:19-20; Matt 25:21, 23; Eph 4:11-16; 1 Tim 3:15-16 OUTLINE Examples in the Bible: The footsteps of Moses Heb 11:24-27: By faith refusing to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter v. 24.
[54]  Choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin v. 25.
[55]  Although there are only three meetings for this training for the working saints, I hope to release all the burden I have within me.
[56]  In the last chapter, we saw that the working brothers and sisters are the backbone of the church life.
[57]  Not only did Paul suffer the loss of all things and count them refuse, but he pursued to be found in Christ Phil 3:9 .
[58]  Paul Becoming the One to Usher in the New Testament Ministry Completing the Word of God the Revelation of God's New Testament Economy
[59]  In Colossians 1:25 he said, "I became a minister according to the stewardship of God, which was given to me for you, to complete the word of God."
[60]  This revelation centers mainly on two things: the mystery of God, which is Christ, and the mystery of Christ, which is the church.
[61]  Participating in the Joy of Christ in the Kingdom
[62]  In Matthew 25, the Lord repeated twice the word about participating in the joy of Christ in the kingdom.
[63]  The Lord said the same word to the good slave who gained five talents from five and to the one who gained two talents from two: "Well done, good and faithful slave; you were faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things; enter into the joy of your lord" vv.
[64]  If the working saints will rise up today, the church will become a full-grown man.
[65]  CHAPTER EIGHT A NORMAL LIFE AND SERVICE Scripture Reading: Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Acts 11:29; 1 Cor 16:2; Rom 12:1; 1:14; Matt 4:19; 1 Tim 2:1, 4; 1 Cor 9:16-17; Acts 5:42; 1 Thes 2:20; John 21:15-16; 4:24; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14:26, 1, 5, 39; Eph 4:12, 15-16; Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20 OUTLINE A normal life: Being different from the world Rom 12:2: Those in the world belong to the world and are for the world.
[66]  The believers belong to the Lord and are for the Lord.
[67]  Being constrained by the Lord to live to the Lord 2 Cor 5:14-15.
[68]  Prove to us once more that You are one spirit with us.
[69]  Setting Up a Proper Schedule of One's Daily Life
[70]  Formerly, you were not living to the Lord, and your way of living was like that of those in the world.
[71]  A NORMAL SERVICE Consecrating Our Bodies and Our Time
[72]  In order to have the proper service, we must first consecrate our bodies and our time.
[73]  Romans chapter twelve shows us that to practice the Body life, we must first offer up our bodies.
[74]  Attending the District Meetings for the Building Up of the Church
