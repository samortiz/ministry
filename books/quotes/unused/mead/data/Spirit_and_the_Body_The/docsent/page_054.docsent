   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE APOSTLES' LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The New Testament is the story of those who lived, walked, and worked in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was young, I read books on the life of Paul and the life of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But those books did not tell me that Peter and Paul were living, walking, and moving in their new being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, the books said that Peter and Paul were full of power or full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the concept of these books, power suddenly was poured upon Peter, a fisherman, and Paul, a learned man, and they were enabled to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if we see the light on the matter of the spirit as our real person, we shall see the book of Acts in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Apostles were people living in their new being, in their regenerated spirit indwelt by Christ, the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>JOHN ON THE ISLAND OF PATMOS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The New Testament ends with the case of the aged Apostle John on the island of Patmos.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although John was elderly, he was still living in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Revelation 1:10 John says, "I was in spirit on the Lord's day."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because he was in spirit, he saw the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then in spirit he saw the judgment of God exercised upon the world Rev 4:2, ff.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>, he saw the Great Babylon Rev 17:3, ff.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>, and he saw the New Jerusalem Rev 21:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his spirit, in his new being, his new personality and person, John saw the churches, the world, Babylon, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As one who is growing old, I hope to be one day like John.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I long to be able to say that I was in spirit on the Lord's day, that I heard a voice, that I turned to see it, and that I saw all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How good that would be!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would also like to testify that in spirit I saw the world under God's judgment, the fall of the Great Babylon, and the coming of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not a dream; it is a realization in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How much we need to be in spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to live, walk, and work in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our spirit is no longer an organ, and our soul is no longer our person; today our spirit is our person, and our soul is just an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to say, "Soul, simply be an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Don't talk to me, because you are no longer the person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are my organ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Don't make any proposals to me, for I don't want to live by you anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Instead, I will use you as an organ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Soul, don't you know that today my person is the regenerated spirit indwelt by my dear Lord Jesus Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you know it, then you must go to the grave and rest there."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that we all shall see this crucial matter.</S>
