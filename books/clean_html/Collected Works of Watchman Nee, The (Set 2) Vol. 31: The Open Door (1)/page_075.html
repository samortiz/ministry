<h2 class="head3">Four</h2><p>Sister Ruth:</p><p>When will you and the others be coming back to Shanghai? Will you wait for Peace and then come together? I will not be able to go anywhere for awhile; I moved into the meeting hall last Wednesday. The Normal Christian Church Life is still being typeset. Mr. Lin Gang-biao and Mr. Ho Yueh-chiao are proofreading with me. Hua Feng Printing Company is not as big as it was before, but we are managing to get it typeset there. There really is not enough room to set everything up. Peace and health! Greetings to Sister Phoebe.</p><p>Yun-chun<br />February 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Five</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>Thank and praise God. After returning to Shanghai, my health recovered. Sister Li Li-ying is better now. She is resting at Sister Ku's place. Sister Wei Hsiang-yun of Soochow is now living in the meeting hall. Brother Lu Tze-shing came with her to Shanghai. My sister Guo-ying is working in Kiangsi at the Lin-Chuan Health Clinic. I have written and asked her to return to Shanghai. The brothers and sisters in Shanghai have really progressed and have been pursuing very much since Mr. Nee's last conference. Mrs. Huang You-gan has been healed in her body. Mrs. Tsan Wen-ming's little daughter was taken by God, but her heart is still peaceful. Mrs. Joseph Huang has improved spiritually since the death of her son. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sisters Wang, Chang, and Yuan.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Fu-ru<br />February 24<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Anhwei</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Greetings to my dear Brother Yao-ju in the Lord:</p><p>Your card of February 5 was received on the tenth. I was out in the countryside, so I did not see it until the twelfth. Thank the Lord! We are safe. We also thank you for your prayer. I went to Liu-Jia-Lou on the ninth (thirty-six miles west of the city, where there are fields and a village). The next day Brother Chang Yun-shiu arrived too, and there was a meeting on Friday night. Many sisters came from the neighboring villages, and there were more than ten men. Brother Chang preached the message. Brother Yuan Ling-shu and Brother Lee Teh-chi came together from Huang-Jia-Juang. (It is about thirty-six miles from the city and eighteen miles from where we were.) Brother Yuan went back to Huang-Jia-Juang in the afternoon to do visitation work. (Since Brother Yuan returned home from working in Shou County, he has been living in Huang-Jia-Juang, cooking for himself.) Brother Lee returned to Pai-Ma-Chun, which is about fifty-eight miles from the city. If the Lord allows, Brothers Chang and Yuan will both go to the meetings in Pai-Ma-Chun. Thank the Lord, there has been a table meeting in Huang-Jia-Juang for the last two Lord's Days. There has also been one table meeting in Liu-Jia-Lou. Please pray for the work in the places mentioned above. In July of last year, my personal desire was to move my family to the countryside, so I went to Liu-Jia-Lou to make preparations. God did not allow me to move, and I was sick for two months before I could get out of bed. We met in my home in the city until the city was bombed in December. I then brought my daughters to the countryside. The Catholic Church and the Gospel Chapel have set up a refugee center for women and children, so I brought my five children to live in the Chi Hsiu Girls' School in Nan-Kuan (the refugee center is in Chi Hsiu). My wife can take care of them and also care for the rest of our family, so I am able to go out into the countryside. Please pray for my whole family. My son, Da-re, has two or three brothers as companions. Thank the Lord for His grace. I hope you will discipline him for the Lord's sake and teach him often. May the Lord bless all the brothers and sisters in the assembly with peace. Amen. (Please send me one copy of the second issue of The Open Door.)</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Huang Tze-hou<br />February 13<br />Mailed from Liu-Jia-Lou<br />[Address omitted]</p>
