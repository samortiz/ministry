[1]  CONTENTS The Ground of the Church Practicing the Body Life on the Proper Ground of Oneness The Christian Meetings as a Testimony of the Enjoyment of Christ in Our Daily Life Four Main Items in the Lord's Table Meeting Practical Points Concerning the Lord's Table Meeting
[2]  The messages in this book were given concurrently with messages on the growth in life and the function of life, including the messages published as Christ as the Content of the Church and the Church as the Expression of Christ and The Enjoyment of Christ.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:11; 2:1; 1 Cor 1:2; Rom 1:7
[4]  There are many important matters related to the church life, but the first two main items for our practice and experience are the content of the church and the standing, or the ground, of the church.
[5]  The content of the church is Christ, not merely in teaching or doctrine, but in practice, reality, and experience.
[6]  ALL THE MINISTRIES BUILDING UP THE CHURCH ON THE PROPER GROUND
[7]  Paul went to Corinth to preach the gospel and to do the work of the Lord, but Paul did not set up a Pauline church with Christ as the foundation.
[8]  Apollos went there also, but neither did he set up a church with Christ as the foundation and Apollos as the ground.
[9]  In the same way, Peter did not set up a church with Christ as the foundation and Peter as the ground to establish a Petrine church.
[10]  There was not even a so-called church of Christ, in the divisive sense v. 12 . There was only one church, built with saints of one kind on one foundation Christ and upon one unique ground, the ground of oneness in the locality where that church was.
[11]  In the whole universe there is only one church.
[12]  THE ULTIMATE WAY OF ONENESS IN THE NEW JERUSALEM
[13]  In the New Jerusalem there is one way, one street Rev 22:1 .
[14]  Even if we try to go astray, we eventually will not be able to, because in the New Jerusalem there is only one way, and there will be no possibility to get off of it.
[15]  LEARNING THE LESSONS OF THE CROSS AND OF THE LIMITATION OF GOD'S ORDINATION
[16]  If some new brothers come to a city, they may look at those brothers meeting on the proper ground and notice that they do not speak in tongues.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO PRACTICING THE BODY LIFE ON THE PROPER GROUND OF ONENESS Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5, 11, 13-14, 18a; 14:23; 15:20; 16:2, 6, 15-16
[18]  Some may ask why we pay so much attention to the ground of the church.
[19]  In these days, however, we are clear that God's intention, eternal purpose, and heart's desire are to work Christ into a group of people, to mingle Christ with them, and to build them up to be the living Body of Christ, His living expression, in all the communities where human beings live.
[20]  The second category of Satan's frustrations and damage to the church is the system of the clergy.
[21]  We have substitutes for Christ, we have the clergy, and we have the divisions, but we do not have the church.
[22]  When someone is saved and becomes a member of the Body of Christ, he must live the Body life.
[23]  A REMNANT RETURNING TO SEPARATE THEMSELVES FOR THE ONENESS, BUT NOT TO MAKE A DIVISION
[24]  The people of Israel did as God commanded, but once they were captured, they went into exile in Babylon and other places for seventy years.
[25]  As members of the Body, we must have the Body life, and to be in the Body life, we must find the proper ground, put ourselves on it, and practice the proper church life.
[26]  If we do not realize the proper ground, we may be happy today, but after two months we may all feel unhappy.
[27]  CHAPTER THREE THE CHRISTIAN MEETINGS AS A TESTIMONY OF THE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST IN OUR DAILY LIFE Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 4:22; Gal 6:18; Philem.
[28]  The way to have our Christian life is to exercise our spirit to constantly experience Christ in our spirit.
[29]  Rather, day by day we have to experience Christ in our human spirit.
[30]  MEETING BY BRINGING THE SURPLUS OF THE GOOD LAND AS AN OFFERING TO GOD
[31]  However, if we do know the Old and New Testaments and have some amount of revelation from the Lord, we will realize that this is something that is revealed in the Scriptures.
[32]  LEAVING OUR TRADITION AND OLD CONCEPTS TO COME TO THE MEETING IN A LIVING WAY WITH THE CHRIST WE HAVE ENJOYED
[33]  Regardless of what kind of meeting we have for the Lord's table, for prayer, for study, or for a message we almost always sit and wait for a hymn.
[34]  Because most of us came from the background of traditional Christianity, and we still have that environment surrounding us, it is very hard to change our concept concerning the meetings.
[35]  CHAPTER FOUR FOUR MAIN ITEMS IN THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:21; 11:23-25; 1 Cor 15:45b; John 4:24; 1 John 2:23; Heb 2:11b-12; Matt 26:30 REMEMBERING THE LORD BEING TO PARTAKE OF HIM
[36]  There are four main items that we must practice in the Lord's table meeting.
[37]  Verses 23 through 25 of chapter eleven say, "For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread, and having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me. Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me." This indicates that to remember the Lord in a real way is to take, eat, and drink of Him.
[38]  SENSING THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE MEETING AND FOLLOWING THE FLOW OF THE SPIRIT
[39]  First, we must realize that we are coming to partake of the Lord.
[40]  The principle here is that when we are touched by the Holy Spirit, we realize something of Christ, the Son, and when we experience the Son, He brings us to the Father.
[41]  CHAPTER FIVE PRACTICAL POINTS CONCERNING THE LORD'S TABLE MEETING COMING ON TIME TO THE TABLE MEETING
[42]  Often the attendants at the Lord's table meeting do not come on time.
[43]  Basketball players realize that in order to play a good game, they must have a good start.
[44]  CARING FIRST FOR THE INNER SENSE, AND THEN FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE
[45]  We may not be assured about the direction of the meeting, so we simply come to the Lord to seek and feel for the direction.
[46]  In a certain prayer, we may all sense the flow and know that this is the point we should hit in that meeting.
[47]  As we enjoyed the Lord very much, a sister prayed, "O Lord, the more we enjoy You, the more we are transformed into Your image," or "The more we enjoy You, the more we are one with You in the heavens."
[48]  NOT BEING DORMANT IN THE MEETING BUT BEING PREPARED TO FUNCTION
[49]  The right hymn may be lacking, and there may not be the adequate prayers to bring the meeting into the sense that it is time for the bread and the cup to be passed.
[50]  Therefore, because the church life relies very much on the church meetings, we have to pay our full attention to the meetings in order to practice the church life.
