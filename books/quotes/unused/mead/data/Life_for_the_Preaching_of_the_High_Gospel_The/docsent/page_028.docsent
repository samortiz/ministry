   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN GO THEREFORE AND DISCIPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ALL THE NATIONS Scripture Reading: Matt 28:16-20; Acts 1:8; 13:1-3; 14:23, 26-27</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we come to the last point of the burden for this book.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This point is: "Go therefore and disciple all the nations" Matt 28:19a .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Greek word for nations may also be rendered as Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As we are getting ourselves prepared to go and disciple the nations, we need certain qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to be qualified in certain aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GOING TO THE LAND OF THE GENTILES</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord did not charge His disciples to go and disciple the nations in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He appointed them to go to Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Matthew 4 we are told that Galilee was the land of the Gentiles; it was called "Galilee of the Gentiles" v. 15 . The Lord told the disciples to get out of the so-called holy land and go to the land of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE NEED TO BE TRANSCENDENT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Moreover, the Lord's charge to His disciples took place on a mountain Matt 28:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be outside of the temple, outside of the synagogues, outside of the religious centers, and to be on the mountaintop simply means that you have to be on high ground.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You have to be transcendent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You have to be on the top of the high mountain to see the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Young brothers and sisters, if you have the intention to go and disciple the unbelievers, you have to be on high.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have to be on the top of the high mountain to look down at the pitiful, miserable situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, no doubt, many times He was on the seashore, on the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when He gave the commandment to the disciples to go and disciple others, He did not do it on the beach.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He did it on the top of a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are going to disciple others, first, we have to be on high.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are on the same level as the Americans, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to be on high to disciple others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE LORD HAVING ALL AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN HEAVEN AND ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Next, in Matthew 28:18 the Lord Jesus said, "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some versions use the word power instead of authority, but the Greek word here means authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Authority is higher than power.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let me illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the street, there are policemen and there are cars.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A big car driving on the road has the power, whereas a little policeman has the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter how powerful your car is, you have to come under the authority of the policeman.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, authority is above power.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Jesus has not only power but also authority.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both in heaven and on earth the authority belongs to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Jesus has the authority over the United States, over the Middle East, and over the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Jesus has the authority, not the government of the United States, nor the government of Russia, nor the government of China.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Jesus is above every nation Rev 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to see that Jesus has been given all authority in heaven and on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then when we go, we go with the authority of the ascended, enthroned, and glorified Jesus.</S>
