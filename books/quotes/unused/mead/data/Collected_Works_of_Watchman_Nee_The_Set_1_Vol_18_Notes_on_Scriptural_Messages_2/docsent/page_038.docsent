   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I will tell another story.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before the United States was as flourishing as it is today, British and French immigrants lived on the East Coast of that country.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Later on, people went for gold in San Francisco and started to dig out pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The news spread to the East Coast, and some traveled to San Francisco to dig for gold.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was a certain couple who discussed selling their property in order to dig for gold; they hoped that by doing this they could make a fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Eventually, the husband went, and for over a year the wife received no letter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day the wife received a telegram from her husband, saying, "GOLD COME."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This meant that he had found gold and that she should come.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The wife was extremely happy and took her son and boarded a ship headed for San Francisco.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In those days transportation was not convenient, and the Panama Canal was not yet open.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither were there any trains.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Traveling from the east to the west took a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One day, while they were on the ship, there was a great noise.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the beginning, she thought that there were pirates on board.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She locked the door, sat inside, and would not come out.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later she smelled smoke and realized that something was wrong; perhaps the ship was on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>She opened the door and discovered that the ship was on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She immediately picked up her son and ran to the deck.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The lifeboats were being hoisted down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the last boat was filled with people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Usually when a ship is sinking, the women and children are the first ones to go.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since she had come out so late, everyone else was already in the boats.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She begged desperately, and the sailors promised to take one more person.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that juncture there was a dilemma: was the son to live and the mother to die?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Or was the mother to live and the son to die?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They could not die together or survive together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Either the mother had to die, or the son had to die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Between the two of them, at least one had to die in order for the other to live.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, the mother wrote down her husband's name and address and gave it to the sailors, entrusting them to send the child to her husband upon reaching safety.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then the mother said to her son, "My son!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you see your father, tell him that your mother has died for you in the fire and in the water so that you could see his face."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a small picture of the Lord Jesus' death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>May we hear Jesus saying to us, "Sinners, I died for you on the cross so that you can see the face of the heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I died, and you live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Please believe sincerely."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>My only purpose is to show you that death and judgment are sure.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, God loves us and has prepared a salvation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His Son has died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Friends, please accept Jesus Christ as your Savior today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Please listen to this verse: "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God" John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please pay attention to the word "condemned," which is "judged" in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, "He who believes into Him is not judged; but he who does not believe has been judged already."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse is not spoken by me, but by God and the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Please listen to another verse: "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life" John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This verse tells us that if one hears the Lord Jesus' word and believes in His Sender, 1 he has eternal life; 2 he will not come into judgment; and 3 he has passed out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I would like to ask you whether or not you have believed in the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you have not yet believed, please accept Him as your Savior now.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I once sat beside a dying man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you were sitting by a dying man, I do not know what you would be thinking.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I was preaching at a place, and someone came to ask me to share the gospel with a doctor who was about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He knew a little about the church, but he was gravely ill with tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I arrived at his place and saw him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said, "I have heard of Jesus, but I have always rejected Him."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I urged him to rest, but he said, "I am a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I know the degree to which my illness has reached and that I will die.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I was a military doctor and have met many different kinds of people and have committed many sins.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I regret that there is now no way out.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have committed all these sins, and there is no peace in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After I die, I will not be able to meet God."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He kept speaking this way, but I read John 5:24 to him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When he heard these words, he realized that God desires to give man life and that as long as man would believe, he would obtain eternal life and not come into condemnation, but would pass out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When he received this word, he had peace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There was an absolute difference between the first part of the time that I had with this man and the second part.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When I arrived, he was in tears; when I left, he was able to shake my hand and thank me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I know that some day in heaven I will meet him again.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But friends, please do not wait until that day to believe; do not wait until your last opportunity to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Please say to God now, "God, right now I receive Your Son."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Oh, God's Son has died for you and has borne the judgment for you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Therefore, sinners, please come.</S>
