<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">MAN, SINNER, SIN, AND SINS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Time: Spring 1937<br />Place: Canton</h1><p>(Editor's Note: In the spring of 1937, Brother Nee conducted two studies on "The Gospel of God" in Shanghai and Canton. The Shanghai messages have been published as The Gospel of God (Volumes 28 and 29 of The Collected Works.) The following two chapters are based on the Canton messages, and they are similar in content to the first two chapters of The Gospel of God. The dates of these articles are not known.)</p><p>Tonight I am not here to preach the gospel. Rather, I am here to teach the gospel. In the Bible, there is gospel preaching and there is also gospel teaching. We need to teach the gospel because many have become Christians, yet they do not know how they became Christians. Many Christians know that they have entered the gate, but they do not know how they entered the gate. The message tonight is for those who have entered the gate; it is to show them what the gospel is. Therefore, we are not standing at the entrance compelling or inviting people to come in. We are speaking only to those who have already entered the gate. We want to speak concerning how you have become a Christian. I will not be doing a gospel preaching work; rather, I will do a gospel teaching work. I will not persuade or encourage you to believe the gospel. I only want to tell you how you have obtained the gospel. Just like an instructor who shows his students a map, I will tell you the way that you have come to this point.</p><p>What is the gospel? The gospel concerns how God saved us, that is, how we entered the gate of God's salvation. Tonight we are not in any hurry. I would rather speak slowly so that you may know more about the truths of the gospel. By the grace of God, I want to speak to you concerning the subject of man, sinner, sin, and sins. Tomorrow evening perhaps we can speak about God's love, grace, righteousness, etc. What I am going to speak tonight may not be so pleasant for the ear because people dislike these four items.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN AND SINNER</h2><p>In Genesis God made Adam, that is, man. Adam was the first man. However, his wife, Eve, was not the second man. Eve was just a part of Adam. Even in committing sins, Eve was still a part of Adam. The Bible does not say that Eve sinned independently. Only 1 Timothy 2:14 speaks of Eve's transgression. Other than that instance, the Bible says that Adam was the first man who sinned; only the one man Adam sinned. Eve was taken out of Adam. Since Eve was taken out of Adam, she can be considered as a part of Adam. From God's viewpoint, there was no way for Eve to exist independently by herself. We know that we sin because we were born of Adam. According to God, we are all sinners. Unlike Adam who became a sinner because he sinned, we sin because we were born sinners. There is a big difference between Adam and all other men. Adam became a sinner because he sinned. But we sin because we first are a sinner. Man did not become a sinner because of his sins. Even if a man did not sin, he would still be a sinner. The moment a person is born, he is in Adam. Therefore, man is born a sinner.</p><p>When I was speaking in Kaifeng, someone asked me, "How can we be in Adam?" I said to him, "The Chinese say that they are the descendants of Hwang-ti. When Hwang-ti was fighting with Tzi-you, suppose that Hwang-ti had not killed Tzi-you, but that Tzi-you had shot Hwang-ti with an arrow. Where would you be today?" He said, "Definitely, I would not be here." I said, "What does Hwang-ti's death have to do with your existence?" He said, "If Hwang-ti died, all of his descendants would not have lived, because we all came out of him. Because there was a Hwang-ti, we are here. Without him, we would not be here." I said, "That is right. This is the same as man's existence in Adam." We came out of Adam. Because Adam was a sinner, those who are in Adam are also sinners.</p><p>Suppose you go to a plant nursery to buy a peach tree. Later, this peach tree bears many peaches. If you have bought a good peach tree, it will bear good peaches. If you have bought a bad peach tree, it will bear bad peaches. Sinners are just like trees. Sins committed by the sinners can be likened to the fruit of a tree. A certain kind of tree will bear a certain kind of fruit. The question is which kind are you. The fruit you bear will be according to the kind you are. You sin as a result of being a sinner. You do not become a sinner because you have sinned. This is the fundamental concept of God's salvation. What you are is far more important than what you do. Adam became a sinner because of his sin. But we sin because we are sinners.</p><p>There are two kinds of sinners in this world: One is the sinner who sins, and the other is the sinner who does not sin, or the moral sinner. Whether or not man sins, he is a sinner. For example, man has the ability to speak, but there are some&mdash;namely, those who are dumb&mdash;who cannot speak. However, just because a person cannot speak does not mean that he is not a human being. We can only say that he is a dumb person. Those who can speak are human beings; those who cannot speak are also human beings. There are some sinners who sin, and there are some sinners who are moral. It does not matter who you are. You have always been a sinner. This is why all men need a Savior. Many compare themselves with others and congratulate themselves for not sinning. But in God's eyes, they are only sinners who have not committed a certain kind of sin. Some may think that since they have committed only a few sins, they do not need the Savior. But in God's eyes, they are still sinners; they are just sinners who have committed a few sins. Even if you think that you are moral and have high ethical standards, and that you are very humble and gentle, at most God would consider you to be a very humble sinner. You are still a sinner. You still need the Savior.</p><p>In the book of Romans, there are only two verses prior to 5:19 which use the word sinner. They are 3:7 and 5:8. Romans frequently mentions the many sins of man, but it does not say that man has become a sinner because of the many sins he has committed. There is only one place in the Bible that tells us how man became a sinner, or what constitutes man a sinner. Romans 5:19 says, "Through the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners." The one man who disobeyed was Adam. Many were constituted sinners through his disobedience. Man's sins have not made him a sinner. All those who have been born of Adam are sinners. One time I was teaching a group of elementary students in a Sunday school class. I did not know what to say, and I first asked them what kind of people are sinners, that is, who are sinners. A little girl answered, "Those who sin are sinners." Many who are here tonight are much older than that little girl, but many may think the same thing. This is childish thinking. The Bible says that as long as one is a man he is a sinner. Adam became a sinner because of his sin. But we who came out of Adam are sinners whether or not we have sinned.</p><p>Ordinarily, a peach tree bears fruit. But there are exceptions. Perhaps among one or two million peach trees, there are a few which do not bear fruit. Although these trees do not bear fruit, they are still peach trees. Likewise, there may be one or two men among millions who do not sin. Although they do not sin, they are still sinners. In the seventeen years that I have been preaching, I have never said, "If you do not sin, God will be pleased with you." God abhors sin, and because every man is a sinner and has committed sin, God also abhors the sinners.</p><p>Romans 1 through 8 specifically speaks of how man is a sinner and how he receives salvation. Every Christian should come up to the standard of the book of Romans. If you do not understand the book of Romans, you cannot be a good Christian. Only those who understand the book of Romans can understand God's salvation. Romans 5 is a chapter that deals particularly with sins. The sin spoken of in Romans 5 is the result of man becoming a sinner, that is, man sins because he is already a sinner. Man first has the sinful life, and then he lives a sinful living.</p>
