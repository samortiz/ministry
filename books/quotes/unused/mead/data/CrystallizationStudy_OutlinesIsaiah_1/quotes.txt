[1]  9:6-7; 40:28-31; 42:1-4; 53:5; 55:6-13; 57:15; 66:1-2 Isaiah meaning the salvation of Jah is the leading book among all the books of the prophets, and its subject is the salvation of Jehovah through the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, ascended, and coming Christ; this book is the vision that Isaiah saw 1:1 , the word that Isaiah saw 2:1 , and the burden that Isaiah saw 13:1; 15:1 concerning Christ as the centrality and universality of God s eternal economy 9:6-7; 53:1-12; 40:10 : Isaiah reveals the history of the universe from God s original creation through Satan s rebellion and Christ s processes to accomplish God s judicial redemption and His organic salvation for the producing and building up of the Body of Christ, to usher in the kingdom of God unto the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth v. 22a; 45:18; 14:12-14; 53:5; 12:2-3; 65:17.
[2]  Message Two The Revelation of the Lord Jehovah, the Eternal God Scripture Reading: Isa 1:2, 4; 25:8; 40:28;
[3]  45:15; 29:16; 54:5; 12:2-3; 66:2 Elohim is the name of God in relation to creation, whereas Jehovah is the name of God in relation to man Gen 1:1; 2:4; Isa 1:2, 4: Jehovah means I am who I am, indicating that Jehovah is the self-existing and ever-existing eternal One, the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who will be in the future forever Exo 3:14; Rev 1:4: Jehovah is the only One who is and who depends on nothing apart from Himself, and we must believe that He is Heb 11:6.
[4]  Message Four The Vision of Christ in Glory Scripture Reading: Isa 6:1-8; John 12:38-41 In the year that King Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the temple Isa 6:1: The One who was seen by Isaiah was Christ as the Lord, the King, Jehovah of hosts v. 5b: John, in his account of Christ s living and working on earth, said that Isaiah saw His glory and spoke concerning Him John 12:41.
[5]  In order to see the vision of the glorious enthroned Christ, we need to take heed to Isaiah s warning word Isa 6:9-10 by exercising our spirit to pray that the Lord would open our inner eyes, soften our heart, and keep our heart turned to Him so that we may receive His inner healing of our blindness and sickness John 12:38-40; Matt 13:14-17; Acts 28:25-27; Rev 3:18; 4:2; 2 Cor 3:16-18 .
[6]  Christ s long robe signifies His splendor in His virtues, expressed mainly in and through His humanity; that Christ was wearing a long robe indicates that He appeared to Isaiah in the image of a man; Christ is the enthroned God-man with the divine glory expressed in His human virtues Isa 6:1; cf.
[7]  the Unveiling of Christ as the Wonderful One Scripture Reading: Isa 7:11-14; 8:8; 9:6-7; 63:16; 64:8 Regarding God s economy, the intrinsic connection between the books of history in the Old Testament and their fulfillment in the New Testament is in Isaiah 7:14 and 9:6; these verses indicate that God would put humanity upon Himself, thereby mingling divinity with humanity John 1:14; Luke 1:35; Matt 1:18, 20.
[8]  Message Six The Great Light Scripture Reading: Isa 9:1-5; 42:6; 49:6; 50:10-11; 2:5 The light in Genesis 1:3 is a type of Christ as the real light John 1:4-5, 9: Christ is the true light of the universe; He is the rising sun from on high, the bright morning star, and the Sun of righteousness Luke 1:78; Rev 22:16b; Mal 4:2.
[9]  The physical light in Genesis 1:3 is a type of Christ as the spiritual light for the new creation 2 Cor 4:6; 5:17: Light is necessary for generating life; according to a great principle in the Bible, light is for life, and where light is, there is life John 8:12; 1:9, 12.
[10]  The divine light is the nature of God s expression, it shines in the divine life, and it is the source of the divine truth 1 John 1:5-6; John 1:4; 8:12: Light is God s shining, God s expression; when God is expressed, the nature of that expression is light 1 John 1:5.
[11]  Jer 2:13; Exo 17:6; Num 20:8; John 4:10, 14b God s intention in His economy is to be the fountain, the source, of living waters to dispense Himself into His chosen people for their satisfaction and enjoyment Jer 2:13; Psa 36:8-9; Isa 12:1-6: The goal of this enjoyment is to produce the church, God s counterpart, as God s increase, God s enlargement, to be God s fullness for His expression John 3:29-30; Eph 3:16-19, 21 ; this is the heart s desire, the good pleasure, of God in His economy 1:5, 9; 3:9-11 .
[12]  We need to realize that whenever God s people are short of the Spirit of life as the water of life, they will have problems; when God s people have an abundance of the saving Spirit as the living water, their problems among themselves and with God are solved Exo 17:1-7; Num 20:2-13: Through incarnation Christ came to earth as the rock; on the cross He was smitten by the authority of God s righteous law to accomplish God s redemption, and out of His pierced side flowed blood and water Exo 17:6; 1 Cor 10:4; John 19:34: The blood for our judicial redemption saves us from the guilt of sin, and the water of life in resurrection for our organic salvation saves us from the power of sin Gen 2:21-22; Zech 13:1; Psa 36:8-9; Rev 21:6; Hymns, #1058, stanza 1.
[13]  God s intention in His economy is to work a wonderful person into our being; this person is the all-inclusive Christ, the One who is the reality of every positive thing in the universe Eph 3:17a; Gal 4:19; Col 2:16-17: The all-inclusive Christ, with all that He has attained and obtained, is the One whom God desires to work into our being 3:10-11.
[14]  Message Ten Christ as a Crown of Glory and a Diadem of Beauty
[15]  When we live Christ for His magnification by the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, Christ becomes our expression, our holy garments, to be our glory and our beauty Phil 1:19-21a; 4:22; Exo 28:2; Gal 6:17-18: To have Christ as our glory means to express Christ s divinity with the divine attributes John 1:14; Heb 1:3; John 17:22; 2 Cor 3:18.
[16]  Christ is a foundation, a tested stone, and a precious cornerstone for God s building Isa 28:16; 1 Pet 2:6-7: Christ as the living stone v. 4 , the foundation stone 1 Cor 3:11 , the cornerstone Eph 2:20 , and the topstone Zech 4:6-7 is constituting us with His stone nature to make us living stones 1 Pet 2:5 for His spiritual house, His building; He is also a stumbling stone to the unbelieving religionists and a smiting stone to the nations v. 8; Matt 21:44; Dan 2:34-35 . On Christ as the unique foundation, God s building is growing into a holy temple in the Lord, and we are being built into a dwelling place of God in spirit Matt 16:16-18; 1 Cor 3:11; Eph 2:21-22.
[17]  Message Eleven The Example of Hezekiah s Person and Failure Scripture Reading: Isa 36 39 The first thirty-five chapters of Isaiah concern God s loving chastisement on His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment on the nations, in order that His elect might turn to Him so that the created things might be restored and the all-inclusive Christ might be brought in; at this point, everyone and everything have been discharged by God, and Christ, the only One who is qualified, has come: In chapters 36 through 39 Isaiah provides an example in the person of Hezekiah, the king of Judah; Isaiah shows how a person such as Hezekiah, who was appointed a king in God s kingdom, who was godly, and who prayed and received miraculous answers from God, eventually became not a success but a failure because of his self-glory and self-interest; hence, he too was eventually discharged by God.
[18]  We can learn valuable lessons from the example of Hezekiah; whereas we can learn certain positive things, we can also learn from his failure as a warning to us for our future as members of the Body of Christ; his example can help us to remain pure in our living and service to God for our entire life cf.
[19]  Message Twelve The King Reigning in the Tent of David Scripture Reading: Isa 16:5; 24:23;
[20]  Luke 1:32; John 3:3, 5; Col 1:12-13 The all-inclusive Christ is the King reigning in the tent of David the kingdom of David, the Messianic kingdom in the coming age during the restoration of Israel Isa 16:5; 24:23: The prophets spoke of David and Christ as one Jer 30:9; Ezek.
[21]  34:23-24; 37:24-25; Hosea 3:5; Amos 9:11: David is a type of Christ as the King; Christ, the real David, will be the King in the restoration, the millennium, and He will reign according to righteousness and be the real Shepherd of God s flock Jer 30:9; Isa 32:1; Ezek.
[22]  David s house refers to Christ, David s kingdom refers to Christ s kingdom, and David s throne refers to Christ s throne; the kingdom of David is Christ s kingdom, and David and Christ have one throne v. 16; Isa 9:7; 16:5; Luke 1:32; Acts 2:29-31.
