If we are going to have a proper church life, we must pay adequate attention to the matter of life. The church is not something produced by doctrine or organization. The church is an organism, which is entirely a matter of life. Without life, there is no organism. The church is not only the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15) but also the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). For the church as the Body of Christ, we need life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S INTENTION</H2><P>God's intention seen throughout the Bible is that man would receive Him as life to become His expression in this universe. The first two chapters of the Bible and its last two chapters show us His intention in a particular way. These two sets of chapters are connected directly to each other.</P><P>In Genesis 1 and 2 we see God's creation. God created the heavens and the earth and many things for man to exist in this universe. Then God created man to fulfill His purpose. Man was created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26). The New Testament says that Christ is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15a). This means that man was created according to Christ. Just as a glove was made in the image of a hand in order to contain a hand, man was made in the image of Christ in order to contain Christ. God's intention is to put Christ into man. A container is always made in the form, the style, and the image of its content. If a container is going to contain something round, it also must be round to match its content. A glove is made with five fingers because it contains a hand with five fingers. Likewise, man was made according to the image of Christ because God's intention was to put Christ into man.</P><P>But at the time of creation in Genesis 1, man was an empty container, an empty vessel. In Genesis 2 this empty vessel was put in front of the tree of life (v. 9). This, of course, was with the intention that man would partake of the tree of life to be filled with God as his content. Genesis 2 also tells us that there was a river flowing out of Eden to water the garden, and this one river was parted into four heads&#151;one to the south, one to the north, one to the east, and one to the west &#151;to cover the four directions of the populated earth (v. 10). No doubt, this river was the water for all the people on this earth. Thus, in Genesis 2 we see a tree of life with a flowing river. Then at the flow of this river there are three categories of precious materials&#151;gold, bdellium (a pearl-like substance), and onyx stone (vv. 11-12). In the Bible, gold, pearl, and precious stones are for God's building.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of Christ as Life for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
