   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE ANOINTING OF THE BODY Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:27; Luke 3:22; 4:18; Eph 4:1-10, 30-32; Psa 133</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible shows us that God's anointing is only for the One who has totally satisfied God's heart His Son, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If this is so, why does the Body receive the anointing?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Psalm 133 shows us that the fine oil was poured on Aaron's head and ran down upon his beard to the hem of his garments.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When a man is anointed, the oil is poured on the head of the anointed, not on the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet after the oil is poured, it runs downward and eventually flows to the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the Head is Christ, the Anointed One, the Body is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is God's Anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The church is His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When Christ was anointed, the whole Body was anointed with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the great Anointed One, while the members are the little anointed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet we are not anointed separately; we were anointed in His Body, that is, in Christ, when He was anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is impossible for us to be anointed in ourselves, because the Bible says, "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured" Exo 30:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are anointed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE CONDITION FOR THE ANOINTING BEING</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE BURIAL OF THE NATURAL MAN</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Luke 3:22 tells us what happened after the Lord was baptized in the river Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"The Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And a voice came out of heaven: You are My Son, the Beloved; in You I have found My delight."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Luke 4:18 says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>From these verses we see that the Lord was anointed with the Holy Spirit when He came out of the water of baptism at the Jordan River.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Genesis 8 records that after the flood, Noah opened the window of the ark and sent out a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, the dove could not find any place to rest because the whole earth was filled with water, and it returned back to the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The passage of Noah's ark through the deluge is a type of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the time of Christ's baptism, the Spirit of God descended upon Him like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This signifies that at the time of Christ's baptism, He received the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, when we were baptized, we also received the anointing of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Baptism signifies that everything of the old, natural man is buried.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the anointing to come after baptism means that in order for us to receive the anointing of the Holy Spirit, our flesh must first be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only that which is of the Lord can rise up after baptism because anything that belongs to the believers themselves is only qualified for burial.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Anything that can rise up after burial has to be something in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It can rise up because Christ is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we are baptized in Christ, we pass through death, burial, and resurrection with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, when He was anointed, we were anointed also.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are crucified, buried, resurrected, and anointed together with Him.</S>
