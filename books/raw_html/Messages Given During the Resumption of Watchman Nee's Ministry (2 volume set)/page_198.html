<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. It Being a Shame to Have Selective Fellowship</H2><P>In contacting others, one has to watch out if his standing changes with the acquaintance. It is a shameful thing to have selective fellowship among the co-workers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Learning to Listen to Others</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Listening to Others Being a Basic<br>Qualification of the Workers</H2><P>The third matter is a serious demand on the workers today. It is to learn to listen to others when they speak. The basic requirement, technique, or qualification of a worker is that he can listen to others. You have to be able to sit down for an hour and listen to the brothers and sisters. As the brothers speak, you have to be able to understand sentence by sentence what they are saying. Not only do you have to hear what they are saying; you have to be able to understand what they are saying.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Being Quiet Within,<br>and Not Having One's Own Words</H2><P>While the brothers and sisters are speaking, that is the time that you have to remain quiet. You cannot be saying something else within you at the same time. Many people hear the wrong things because, while they are listening, they are at the same time speaking within. This is like having two radios turned on at the same time at home. When two different stations are speaking at the same time, one cannot hear clearly what either one says. In the same way, if a man cannot listen to others, it is because he himself is also speaking while they are speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Touching Others' Spirit with the Spirit</H2><P>There is another point concerning listening. Man's spirit is revealed through his mouth. When a man speaks, his spirit is released, and it touches the spirit of others. A man's spirit is released through his speaking. If you cannot listen to others, you will not be able to touch their spirit. Whether or not a worker is strong in his work depends on whether or not he is able to touch others' spirit with his spirit. It is difficult to find one in a thousand who can detect others' spirit without listening to their words. Whether a man's spirit is rebellious, defiled, strong, weak, or in any other kind of condition, it is expressed through his words. We have to be an objective person. Only an objective person can listen to others speak. This is the greatest need in our work.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Learning to Speak Accurately</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Speaking Carelessly or Loosely,<br>Not Being Double-tongued</H2><P>The fourth thing is that a worker has to learn to speak accurately at home in his daily life. A careless person has no hope as far as participating in God's work is concerned. A double-tongued person cannot help anyone in any church; he can only cause trouble. Some brothers have asked me how they should study the Bible. I can tell you that only an accurate man can study the Bible. Some people by nature cannot study the Bible. Even if you were to send such a one to the seminary, it would still be useless. He may be able to study philosophy, but he can never study science. Science is accurate, and every bit of knowledge in science is acquired through numerous experiments and verifications. In the Lord's work, there is no such thing as "more or less the same." Either things are the same, or they are not the same. For example, the whiteness of snow is different from the whiteness of a white horse. But the careless ones will say that they are the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Not Speaking from Feelings</H2><P>The sisters should pay particular attention to this matter. In their daily life they should be careful; they should speak properly, sentence by sentence. The careless ones, those who are active in their mind and who have a hard time differentiating between the real and the false things, are of little use in God's hand. The more we want to be accurate in our speaking, the more troublesome it is. It is easy to be careless. But a careless person can only speak from his feeling; he cannot speak accurate words. However, truth is absolute. It cannot change according to your feeling. Truth is not affected by anything.</P>
