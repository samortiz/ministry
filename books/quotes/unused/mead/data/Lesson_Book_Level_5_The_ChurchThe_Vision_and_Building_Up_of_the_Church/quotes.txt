[1]  INTRODUCTION TO THE LESSON BOOK Concerning the Lesson Books
[2]  This lesson book is one in a series originally designed to teach the truth to junior high and high school students during their summer school of the truth.
[3]  THE CHURCH BEING THE BUILDING UP OF ALL GOD'S CHOSEN, REDEEMED, REGENERATED, AND TRANSFORMED PEOPLE, NOT A PHYSICAL STRUCTURE
[4]  V. THE NATURE OF THE CHURCH BEING OF HEAVEN, NOT OF EARTH
[5]  Since the source of the church is the Triune God, the nature of the church is of heaven and not of earth.
[6]  We began by being seated in the heavenlies with Christ Eph 2:6 .
[7]  Questions Use several verses to describe how God's eternal purpose is the church.
[8]  Use different portions from the Bible to prove that the church is a building of people and is not physical.
[9]  Lesson Two GOD'S PURPOSE FOR THE CHURCH Scripture Reading Eph 1:4-5, 9-11; 3:9-11; 1 Pet 1:2-4; 2:2; 1 Cor 3:6; 2 Cor 3:16-18; 4:16-18; 1 Thes 5:16-18, John 2:19 Outline To express God through the sonship To make God's wisdom known to the enemy To head up all things in Christ Text
[10]  Nearly all of the things revealed about God's eternal plan for the church are found in the two books of Ephesians and Colossians.
[11]  When put together, these two books reveal a universal man, composed of Christ the Head, and the church the Body!
[12]  There are three main items concerning the church in the economy of God.
[13]  The first is that the church might have the sonship, and that God might be expressed through this sonship.
[14]  The third main aspect of the church in God's economy is the heading up of all things in Christ.
[15]  How does the church make known God's wisdom to His enemy?
[16]  Lesson Three THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 1 THE ASSEMBLY, THE HOUSE OF GOD, AND THE KINGDOM OF GOD Scripture Reading 1 Cor 1:2; Matt 18:20; Gen 28:12, 16-17; John 1:51; 1 Tim 3:15; Heb 3:6; 1 Pet 4:17; Eph 2:22, 19; Rom 14:17 Outline The assembly of the called out ones ekklesia The house of God The dwelling place of God The kingdom of God Being the living of the Church The entrance into the kingdom of God Text
[17]  In this lesson we come to the status of the church.
[18]  Questions How does the first status of the church show that the church is not a physical building, but the built-up believers?
[19]  In this age the church is the reality of the kingdom.
[20]  What is God's requirement for us to be in this kingdom today?
[21]  Lesson Four THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 2 THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading Eph 4:4; 1:22-23; 5:23; 1 Cor 12:12-13, 15, 21; Eph 3:8, 19; Col 3:11; John 6:48, 57, 63 Outline Christ being the Head We being the members of the Body of Christ The Body receiving from the Head The fullness expression of Him who fills all in all The fullness expression of God Text
[22]  The organism of the Triune God is a Body Eph 4:4 .
[23]  The very abstract and mysterious God has an organism.
[24]  In Ephesians 5:23 Paul says, "Christ is Head of the church, being Himself the Savior of the Body.''
[25]  THE FULLNESS EXPRESSION OF HIM WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL
[26]  In Ephesians 3:19 the King James Version says we are "filled with all the fullness of God.''
[27]  The preposition with literally means "unto, resulting in.''
[28]  Questions What is the significance of Christ being the Head of the Body?
[29]  We have seen that the Body of Christ is composed of organic members.
[30]  Could you hire or fire anyone for a particular function in the Body?
[31]  Lesson Five THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 3 GOD'S MASTERPIECE, THE NEW MAN, AND THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST Scripture Reading Eph 2:10; 2:15; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11; Gen 1:26-27; Eph 6:12; 5:22-33; Gen 2:21-24; John 3:29-30; 2 Cor 11:2; Rev 19:7-8; 21:2, 7-9, 17 Outline God's masterpiece The new man Created by Christ on the cross Bearing God's image to express Him Fighting as a warrior The counterpart of Christ The church as the bride, the wife, of Christ as the Bridegroom, the Husband To be married at Christ's coming back To be consummated in the New Jerusalem for eternity To be a couple in eternity Text I. GOD'S MASTERPIECE
[32]  Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are His workmanship.''
[33]  God's creation of man in Genesis 1 is a picture of the new man in God's new creation.
[34]  This means that the old creation is a figure, a type, of the new creation.
[35]  In his exhortation in Ephesians 5:22-33, Paul presents the church as the counterpart of Christ.
[36]  This reveals that the church is actually a part of Christ, for the church comes out of Christ and is unto Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam and was unto Adam Gen 2:21-23 .
[37]  In Revelation 19:7 and 8 we see that Christ and His counterpart, His bride, will be married at His coming back.
[38]  Verse 7 says, "Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready.''
[39]  Questions What does the term "masterpiece'' imply when referring to the church?
[40]  What is the difference between the old man and new man?
[41]  List as many parallels as you can between Eve as the bride of Adam, and the church as the bride of Christ.
[42]  Lesson Six THE STATUS OF THE CHURCH 4 THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS Scripture Reading Exo 25:31-40; Zech 3:9; 4:2-10; Rev 1:11-12, 20b; 4:5; 5:6; Col 2:9; 1:15; Gen 1:26; 1 John 5:11-12; Rev 21:18b, 23; 22:1, 5 Outline The golden lampstands typifying Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God Gold signifying the Father's divine nature, the divine substance, essence The form signifying the Son as the embodiment of the Godhead in His humanity The seven lamps signifying the Spirit as the expression The golden lampstands signifying Israel as God's testimony in the Old Testament and in the millennium Shining through the Seven Eyes Spirits of Jehovah As the Seven Eyes of Christ the Stone-Savior for God's Building The golden lampstands signifying the seven local churches as God's testimony in the New Testament Shining in the dark age as in the night, bearing the testimony of Jesus With the Father's divine essence In the Son's human form Through the Spirit's expression To be consummated in the New Jerusalem Expressing the processed Triune God in eternity
[43]  One of the crucial symbols in the Bible is that of the lampstands.
[44]  C. The Seven Lamps Signifying the Spirit as the Expression
[45]  Exodus 25:37 says, "Thou shalt make its lamps, seven.''
[46]  These seven lamps signify God the Spirit being the seven Spirits of God for His expression Rev 4:5; 5:6 .
[47]  THE SEVEN GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS SIGNIFYING THE SEVEN LOCAL CHURCHES AS GOD'S TESTIMONY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT
[48]  The golden lampstand is not a lump of gold but gold in a definite form and purposeful shape.
[49]  Questions Write a short essay about how the symbol of lampstand reveals the Triune God.
[50]  Why is the lampstand an appropriate symbol for the church?
[51]  Explain in detail the final stage of the church as the lampstand?
[52]  Lesson Seven THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH UNIVERSAL AND LOCAL Scripture Reading Matt 16:16-18; Eph 1:22-23; Matt 18:17; Eph 2:22; 4:4; Titus 1:5; Acts 14:23; 13:1; Rev 1:4a, 11; Acts 2:42; 1 Cor 10:16-17 Outline The truth according to the Bible The universal aspect Including all New Testament believers As revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18 The local aspect The believers living in the local churches The local churches being the local expressions of the Body of Christ All the local churches constituting the one Body of Christ The genuine ground The ground of locality one city, one church The ground of the genuine oneness one body universally The local administration and the universal fellowship The administration being separate and equal locally The fellowship being one universally
[53]  After seeing all the glorious details of the status of the church, we will address the two crucial aspects of the church the universal and local aspects.
[54]  B. As Revealed by the Lord in Matthew 16:18
[55]  In Matthew 16:18 we have the Lord's first mentioning of the church.
[56]  In this verse He says, "On this rock I will build My church.''
[57]  B. The Ground of the Genuine Oneness One Body Universally
[58]  The ground of the church should not be merely local; it should also be universal.
[59]  Locally, the ground of the church is the ground of locality; universally, the ground of the church is the genuine oneness.
[60]  Lesson Eight THE FORMATION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading Rom 5:18-19; 1 Pet 3:18; John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3; 1 Cor 15:45; John 20:19-22; 7:39; Acts 1:8; Luke 1:35; 1 Cor 12:13; Matt 16:18; Eph 1:22-23; Acts 2:33, 17; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4; Luke 4:18 Outline Christ's crucifixion to redeem people for the church Christ's resurrection to regenerate people to be living members of the church Christ's ascension to pour out the Spirit on His people to form the church Being universal On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius By Christ the Head Through the outpouring of the Spirit The baptism in the Holy Spirit On the one hundred twenty believers On the believers in Cornelius' house Text
[61]  Many Christians prefer one "church'' over another because it appeals to their personal preference, or they form their own church when they want to do something different.
[62]  I. CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION TO REDEEM PEOPLE FOR THE CHURCH
[63]  In forming the church, we first need the material, the people of God.
[64]  CHRIST'S ASCENSION TO POUR OUT THE SPIRIT ON HIS PEOPLE TO FORM THE CHURCH
[65]  After appearing to His disciples for a period of forty days, the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens.
[66]  Through the once-for-all baptism in the all-inclusive Spirit, the church, in the eyes of God, was once for all, universally formed to be the fullness of Christ for His universal expression.
[67]  It is after this universal formation of the Body of Christ that, through the centuries, all God's chosen people were, are, and will be brought into not only the reality but also the practicality of the Body of Christ until the completion is reached.
[68]  First, the outpouring of the Spirit was on the one hundred twenty believers Acts 1:15; 2:1-4 .
[69]  Questions Briefly describe why Christ is the only one capable of forming the church; and what steps were necessary for Him to do it.
[70]  List three references each for the essential and economical aspect of the Spirit.
[71]  Why were the believers able to receive the Spirit essentially before Christ's ascension; whereas, the receiving of the Spirit economically was not until after Christ's ascension?
[72]  Lesson Nine THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LOCAL CHURCHES Scripture Reading Acts 1:8; 8:1; 13:1; 14:23; 1 Cor 1:2; 2 Cor 8:1; Rev 1:4, 11; 1 Tim 3:1; Titus 1:5; Acts 20:28; Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 5:19-20 Outline The need for establishing churches Being local The pattern of the apostles in the New Testament Starting from Jerusalem Spreading to Judea, Samaria, and Galilee Reaching Antioch in Syria Spreading in the provinces of Syria and Cilicia Turning to Asia Minor Spreading to the province of Asia in Asia Minor Reaching Europe churches raised up in the province of Macedonia Spreading to the province of Achaia, next to Macedonia churches raised up in Spreading to Italy The government of the established local churches Text
[73]  In the last lesson we talked about the formation of the universal church.
[74]  In this lesson we shall consider the establishment of the local churches.
[75]  Why is there a need to establish the churches?
[76]  The universal church has already been formed by the Triune God, but where can people see it?
[77]  Acts 11:19-26 records the spread of the gospel to Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch through the scattered disciples.
[78]  After the churches were established in Syria and Cilicia, Paul and Silas were sent by the apostles from Jerusalem to strengthen them.
[79]  Elders as Overseers Appointed in These Churches by the Spirit
[80]  To the elders of the church in Ephesus Paul said, "Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers'' Acts 20:28a .
[81]  Thessalonica, like Philippi, was a city of the Roman Empire in the province of Macedonia, north of the province of Achaia.
[82]  In Romans 16:3-5a Paul says, "Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the nations; and greet the church in their house.''
[83]  Questions What is the difference between forming the church and establishing churches?
[84]  Lesson Ten THE FAILURES IN THE CHURCHES, THE DEGRADATION AND RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading Acts 5:1-11; 6:1; 15:1-2; Col 2:8, 16, 20-22; 2 Tim 1:15; Ezra 1:3-11; 1 Tim 1:3-4; John 5:17 Outline The failures in the churches The degradation of the church During the New Testament After the New Testament The recovery of the church Typified by the return of the children of Israel from their captivity Indicated in the later epistles of the New Testament To be recovered: From the divisive and apostate ground with its deviation from the truths concerning: The person of the Triune God The person and work of Christ Back to the unique and pure ground of the oneness of the Body of Christ with its truths concerning: The New Testament faith and God's economy The person and work of Christ The person and the dispensing of the Triune God The church, the Body of Christ, the Corporate Christ The universal and local aspects of the church To build the Body of Christ, the temple of God, the house of God To establish the kingdom life
[85]  In the previous lessons we have only considered the positive things of the church.
[86]  There is a difference between the failures in the churches and the degradation of the church.
[87]  The church further degraded after the completion of the New Testament.
[88]  Satan tried his best to destroy the church because he knew that the builded church would destroy him.
[89]  The recovery of the church is fully revealed in the New Testament even though the word "recovery'' is not used.
[90]  We do not find the recovery of the church in such Epistles as Romans or 1 Corinthians, but we do find it in Titus, 2 Timothy, 2 John, and Revelation.
[91]  Back to the Unique and Pure Ground of the Oneness of the Body of Christ with Its Truths concerning: a. The New Testament Faith and God's Economy
[92]  In 1 Timothy 1:3 and 4 Paul says, "Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently, nor to occupy themselves with myths and unending genealogies, which give occasion for questionings rather than God's dispensation which is in faith.''
[93]  This is God's household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people, that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ 1 Tim 3:15 .
[94]  Questions Explain the difference between the failures of the church and the degradation of the church?
[95]  What are the items of degradation of the church revealed in the New Testament?
[96]  Lesson Eleven THE SEVEN CHURCHES IN REVELATION SIGNIFYING THE SEVEN STAGES OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading Rev 1:3; 22:7; 2:1-29; 3:1-22 Outline The church in Ephesus depicts the end of the stage of the initial church during the last part of the first century The church in Smyrna prefigures the suffering church under the persecution of the Roman Empire from the last part of the first century to the early part of the fourth century The church in Pergamos pre-symbolizes the worldly church, the church married to the world The church in Thyatira pre-symbolizes the apostate church from the ordination of the papal system in the latter part of the sixth century to the end of the church age The church in Sardis prefigures the protestant church, from the reformation in the early part of the sixteenth century to Christ's coming back The church in Philadelphia prefigures the church of brotherly love, the recovery of the proper church life, from the early part of the nineteenth century to the second appearing of the Lord The church in Laodicea foreshadows the degraded church life of the brothers from the latter part of the nineteenth century to the Lord's return Text
[97]  Revelation is a book of prophecy Rev 1:3; 22:7 , for the revelation it contains is in the nature of prophecy.
[98]  To overcome in this epistle means to overcome persecution by being faithful unto death.
[99]  The Lord said, "Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life'' 2:10b .
[100]  B. The Lord's Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage
[101]  To overcome here means specifically to overcome the church's union with the world, the teaching of idolatry and fornication, and the teaching of the hierarchy.
[102]  In verse 26 the Lord says that to the one who overcomes He will give authority over the nations.
[103]  This is a prize to the overcomers of reigning with Christ over the nations in the millennial kingdom 20:4, 6 .
[104]  This promise of the Lord strongly implies that those who do not answer His call to overcome the apostate church will not participate in the reign of the millennial kingdom.
[105]  As a sign, the church in Philadelphia prefigures the proper church life recovered by the brothers who were raised up by the Lord in England in the early part of the nineteenth century.
[106]  In Revelation 3:11 and 12 we have the Lord's promise to the overcomers in Philadelphia.
[107]  To overcome in this epistle means to hold fast what we have in the recovered church.
[108]  In 3:20b and 21 we have the Lord's promise to the overcomers of this stage.
[109]  To overcome here means to overcome the lukewarmness and pride of the degraded recovered church, to buy the needed items, and to open the door for the Lord to come in.
[110]  Lesson Twelve THE CONSUMMATION OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading Eph 2:8; Rev 5:9; Eph 1:22-23; 2 Cor 3:18; Rev 12:5; 14:4; Matt 25:21; Heb 12:6; Rev 21:14 Outline All the members of the church are produced in the church age The New Testament overcomers are also perfected in the church age The perfection of the New Testament overcomers in the church age The reward of the New Testament overcomers At the end of the church age In the age of the millennium The immature believers will be perfected in the age of the millennium Through the Lord's dispensational and governmental discipline As illustrated by the case of the unfaithful slave As illustrated by the case of the slothful slave All the regenerated and perfected believers of the New Testament will be the components of the New Jerusalem, which is the church's ultimate consummation Consummated in enjoying the eternal and divine life of the processed and consummated Triune God Consummated in experiencing the mingling of humanity with divinity Consummated in expressing the Triune God in His ultimate manifestation for eternity
[111]  This is the last lesson on the vision concerning the church.
[112]  The last twelve lessons will cover how to build up the church.
[113]  B. The Reward of the New Testament Overcomers 1.
[114]  The believers may be overcomers either as the man-child the dead overcomers Rev 12:5 or as the firstfruits the living overcomers Rev 14:4 .
[115]  B. As Illustrated by the Case of the Unfaithful Slave
[116]  The Lord's dispensational and governmental discipline of the immature believers in the age of the millennium is illustrated by the cases of the unfaithful slave and the slothful slave in Matthew 24:48-51 and 25:24-30.
[117]  Matthew 24:48 and 49 speak of an evil slave who says in his heart, "My master is delaying his coming,'' and who begins to "beat his fellow slaves, and eat and drink with the drunken.''
[118]  ALL THE REGENERATED AND PERFECTED BELIEVERS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT WILL BE THE COMPONENTS OF THE NEW JERUSALEM, WHICH IS THE CHURCH'S ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION
[119]  God's intention is that the church will consummate in the New Jerusalem.
[120]  Questions What are the items concerning the perfecting the members of the church that can only be accomplished in this age the age of grace?
[121]  What will be the reward or punishment of the church members during the millennium?
[122]  Lesson Thirteen THE INDIRECT BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BY THE GIFTS TO THE BODY Scripture Reading Matt 16:16-18; Eph 4:8-14 Outline Christ's prophecy on building the church Building the church on this rock The gates of Hades not being able to prevail against the church The way Christ builds up the church By the gifted persons and the perfected saints By the ascended Head giving the gifts to His Body The gifts to the church some apostles The gifts to the church some prophets The gifts to the church some evangelists The gifts to the church some shepherds and teachers For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ Text
[123]  In the first twelve lessons, we have seen the vision concerning the church.
[124]  In the next twelve lessons, we will see the building up of the church and our participation in her building up.
[125]  We not only want to show you a heavenly vision of the church, we also want you to know how this vision can be accomplished.
[126]  I. CHRIST'S PROPHECY ON BUILDING THE CHURCH A. Building the Church on This Rock
[127]  The Lord prophesied in Matthew 16 that He would build His church, which is His Body, upon this rock.
[128]  On the one hand, this rock signifies Christ; on the other hand, it signifies the revelation seen by the apostles.
[129]  The Bible shows us that, on the one hand, the Body of Christ is built upon Christ Himself, with Him as the foundation 1 Cor 3:11 .
[130]  B. The Gates of Hades Not Being Able to Prevail against the Church
[131]  In Matthew 16:18 the Lord continued by saying, "the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it the church .''
[132]  The gates of Hades is the authority of Satan's darkness; it is also the authority of death.
[133]  However, it cannot prevail against the church, for the church is the Body of Christ, the Head, who sits on the throne in heaven.
[134]  B. By the Ascended Head Giving the Gifts to His Body
[135]  The intrinsic building up of the church is by the ascended Head giving the gifts Eph 4:8-11 .
[136]  Ephesians 4:8 says, "Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.''
[137]  Peter and John did not see this when the Lord ascended before their eyes, but the angels saw a tremendous and great train of vanquished foes as a procession for the celebration of Christ's victory.
[138]  We were there in that procession; Satan was there; and death was also there.
[139]  In the Lord's recovery, all the gifts such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers should do the work of perfecting.
[140]  In other words, they should all do the work of training.
[141]  Questions How is it possible for Christ to build up the church?
[142]  Lesson Fourteen THE DIRECT BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST BY THE PERFECTED SAINTS Scripture Reading Eph 4:12-13, 15-16; 2 Cor 4:1; 3:8-9; Rom 5:18b; Jude 3b; Eph 2:15b; 4:24; 4:1 Outline Being willing and ready to be perfected The saints being perfected by the perfecting gifts with the life supply as the nourishment for the growth in life Unto the work of the ministry unto the building up of the Body of Christ Until we the gifted persons and the saints all arrive The oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God A full-grown and mature man The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ Text
[143]  We have seen that God's intention is to give the gifted persons the apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers to perfect the saints that all the saints may participate in the work of the building up of the Body of Christ.
[144]  The Lord desires all the saints to be perfected Eph 4:13 , but the Bible shows us that the Lord is calling for overcomers.
[145]  In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord is sounding the trumpet for overcomers.
[146]  THE SAINTS BEING PERFECTED BY THE PERFECTING GIFTS WITH THE LIFE SUPPLY AS THE NOURISHMENT FOR THE GROWTH IN LIFE
[147]  Questions Why do we say that those willing to be perfected are overcomers?
[148]  What does it mean to be willing to be perfected?
[149]  Lesson Fifteen THE BUILDING UP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST IN ONENESS Scripture Reading 1 Cor 8:4; Isa 45:5; John 17:20-23; Eph 2:15; Rom 15:7; Phil 2:2; 1 Cor 12:25; Psa 133:1-3 Outline God being one In His essence In His purpose In His economy In His acts The unique God having a unique expression The Lord's aspiration and prayer concerning the oneness of the Body The Lord's accomplishment of the oneness of the Body The fulfillment of the oneness of the Body The practice of the oneness of the Body universally Receiving the teaching and fellowship of the apostles Staying in fellowship with all the churches The practice of the oneness of the Body locally On the ground of oneness Being one with all the saints Submitting to the authority of the elders
[150]  Oneness is crucial for Christ, the perfecting gifts, and the perfected saints to build up the Body of Christ.
[151]  If there is no oneness, it is impossible to build up the Body of Christ.
[152]  THE LORD'S ACCOMPLISHMENT OF THE ONENESS OF THE BODY
[153]  All the local churches should remain in fellowship with one another.
[154]  In order to build up a proper local church, we need to be one with all the saints in the church.
[155]  Many Christians think that after they are saved initially, they simply wait to go to heaven.
[156]  In the gospel preaching, there are some wrong concepts that I must point out to you.
[157]  In some of the denominational churches there is much activity in the outreach of the gospel.
[158]  Going out to visit people is the most effective way to spread the gospel for the kingdom of God.
[159]  Actually, visiting people by knocking on their doors is not a new way but an ancient way.
[160]  Questions Why is the picture of fruit-bearing such a good illustration of the increase of the church?
[161]  It is wrong for us to preach the gospel using our human effort, however we must preach the gospel; how then do we do it?
[162]  Meetings enable God's called out congregation to be supplied, established, and perfected, that the goal of God's calling this assembly may be accomplished.
[163]  We have all received the all-inclusive Christ as the good land Col 1:12 .
[164]  God's ordained way for Christian meetings is to have two different sizes of meetings: small and large.
[165]  EXAMPLES OF THE MEETINGS IN THE NEW TESTAMENT A. The First Meeting of the Church Before Pentecost
[166]  After His resurrection, the Lord came to meet with His disciples, starting from the evening of the first day.
[167]  HOW TO MEET A. Being Gathered Into the Lord's Name
[168]  Matthew 18:20 says, "For where are gathered together into My name, there I am in their midst.''
[169]  List the different types of meetings and their purpose.
[170]  Lesson Eighteen THE PRAYER MINISTRY OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading Matt 16:18-19; 18:18-19; Eph 6:17-20; Ezek.
[171]  36:37; Isa 62:6-7; 1 John 1:9; Acts 1:14; 4:31; 12:5; 13:2-4; 20:36 Outline The principles of God's work The prayer ministry of the church binding and loosing what has been bound and loosed in heaven Examples of prayer in Acts Two types of prayer Prayer to have fellowship with God Prayer for God's work Individual and corporate prayer Pray specifically and persistently Pray at set times and all the time Pray with the Word and a note book Text
[172]  In this lesson we will fellowship concerning one of the most crucial ministries of the church the prayer ministry.
[173]  When God works, He does so with specific law and definite principle.
[174]  Even though He could do whatever pleases Him, yet He never acts carelessly.
[175]  Matthew 18:18 says, "Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall be what has been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall be what has been loosed in heaven.''
[176]  They are the church, because in the preceding verse the Lord mentions the church.
[177]  In Acts chapters 1 and 2 we see that 120 disciples were praying.
[178]  After having the proper fellowship with God in prayer, a foundation is laid for us to go on to petition God for His work.
[179]  Because of our proper fellowship, the Lord is able to impart into us His burden for a particular person or matter.

[183]  The priesthood is crucial to the building up of the church.
[184]  There are three aspects of the priesthood holy, royal, and gospel.
[185]  First Peter 2:5 says, "You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.''
[186]  First Peter 2:9 says, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, so that you may tell out the virtues of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.''
[187]  V. HOW TO PRACTICE THE PRIESTHOOD A. Be Revived Every Morning to be Saturated with the Lord
[188]  In the Old Testament, the priests start to offer sacrifices to God in the morning.
[189]  Therefore, we also must enjoy the Lord in the Word every day early in the morning to have a new start each day Psa 119:147-148 .
[190]  After your friends receive the Lord, you must continue to pray for them and shepherd them into life, so that they may be established in the faith.

[193]  In the next five lessons, we will clarify our role in the church life so that we may participate in the building up of the church.
[194]  In lesson one, we pointed out that the church was in God's eternal plan.
[195]  Ephesians 1:3-5 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ, according as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love, having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.''
[196]  V. ENTERING THE CHURCH BY BELIEVING AND BEING BAPTIZED
[197]  Our participation in the Father's choosing and predestinating, the Son's redemption, resurrection, and ascension, and the Spirit's infilling and outpouring is for our entrance into the church.
[198]  We had no choice in these matters, because we were not yet born.
[199]  Sometimes you may be discouraged by the condition of the church, or because the condition of the church does not match the heavenly vision.

[203]  Having the proper attitude helps to build up the church.
[204]  If we have Body consciousness we will comprehend immediately that the Body is one.
[205]  If a person has Body consciousness he at once recognizes his place in the Body; that is to say, he sees himself as being one of its members.
[206]  According to our experiences over the past years, ambition has been the source of all the problems in the church life.

THE GOSPEL NEEDS TO BE PREACHED
[214]  In Matthew 24:14 the Lord said, "And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in the whole inhabited earth for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end shall come."
[215]  The "gospel of the kingdom," including the gospel of grace Acts 20:24 , not only brings people into God's salvation, but also into the kingdom of the heavens Rev 1:9 .
[216]  THE SAVED ONES NEED TO COME TO THE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH
