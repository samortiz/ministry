   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE SEVENTY BEING DEALT WITH 4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we read Jacob's record in the book of Genesis, we need to remember that the whole Bible is the word of life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible contains teachings, stories, prophecies, and types, most of which apparently are unrelated to life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But since the whole Bible is the word of God as life, we should not consider the stories in the Bible as mere stories.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must look to the Lord that He might show us the life in all the stories.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Most Christians have considered the stories in the book of Genesis merely as stories, neglecting the life found in them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we were young, many of us enjoyed hearing the stories in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Undoubtedly, the stories in the Bible are the best.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May the Lord give us a way to receive the nourishment of life in all the stories in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have pointed out that as far as the experience of life is concerned, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph should not be considered as four separate individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the experience of life, these four persons are one complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Abraham, we see God's calling, justification by faith, living by faith in God, and living in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But in the experience of God there are not only God's calling, justification, faith, and fellowship; we also have been selected and predestinated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob we see various aspects of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Only by putting these three people together with Joseph do we see the completion of the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have seen that Jacob needs Joseph to complete him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The New Testament reveals clearly that we have been predestinated to be the sons of God Eph 1:5 , even the royal sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All God's sons shall be kings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the book of Revelation we are told that the saints will even be co-kings with Christ to rule over the nations in the kingdom Rev 2:26-27; 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not see the kingship in either Abraham or Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Even if we look at Jacob himself we cannot see the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is clearly revealed in Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>During the time of the last chapters of Genesis, the whole world was under the reign of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Pharaoh, however, was merely a figurehead.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The real ruler on earth at that time was Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since Joseph represented Jacob, the ruler over the earth was actually Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Jacob ruled through his son Joseph who was the ruling aspect of Jacob's life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph constitute one complete experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This experience of God begins with selection and consummates with kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Genesis 1:26 reveals that God's goal in His creation of man was for man to express Him in His image and to represent Him with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we see something of God in Abraham, we do not see in him very much of the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, in neither Abraham nor Isaac do we see God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even in Jacob himself we can barely see God's dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's dominion is seen in Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Jacob with Joseph God's image and dominion are clearly revealed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Eventually, Jacob was called Israel, the prince of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His name includes God's name.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the transformed name of Jacob we have the name of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because Jacob had truly been transformed into God's image, in his being there was the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>While Jacob had the expression, Joseph had the dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, as one complete unit, they expressed God and represented Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we would see this, we must have spiritual enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to pray, saying, "Lord, open our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We don't just want to read the stories in the Bible and get knowledge from them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We want to see the light of life in these stories and be nourished by the life they contain."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In Abraham we cannot see much of God's dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Neither do we see God's dealing in Isaac, for God never dealt with him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Isaac simply loved to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to our opinion, none of us would agree with this, saying, "God, why do You deal with me all the time?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why didn't You deal with Isaac?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Isaac even sold Your blessing for savory meat."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 27:3 and 4, Isaac said to Esau, "Go out to the field, and take me some venison; and make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If a brother did this today, we would say, "Brother, you shouldn't do this.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is too fleshly and worldly."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But Isaac was not rebuked for doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In fact, although Isaac blessed blindly and wrongly, God honored his blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This clearly indicates that Isaac does not represent the life which has been dealt with by God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jacob's life is the life which represents God's dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Time after time, God did not let Jacob go.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Instead, He kept His hand upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In chapter twenty-nine, Jacob, after coming to Laban's home, was put into the transformation room.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As we have seen, Isaac, Rebekah, and Esau worked together to force Jacob to escape from his home.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Isaac was simple, easygoing, and not disposed to exercise his discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This was his disposition and character.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Rebekah, however, was clever, ingenious, and manipulative.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Being a strong wife and mother, she manipulated the whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Esau, the brother, was not very intelligent, but he was physically strong and seemed to say, "Jacob, I don't know how to exercise my mind as you do, but I do know how to exercise my fist.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You may be smart, but one day I will kill you."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>These three people worked together as a team to chase Jacob away, forcing him to leave his loving mother and his father's home.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We know that Jacob suffered on his journey by the fact that he "lifted up his voice and wept" when he saw his cousin Rachel 29:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Jacob had been very lonesome.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All that he had experienced prior to coming to Laban's home was simply to bring him into the room of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In chapter twenty-nine, Jacob was admitted to this room.</S>
