   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we come to the crucial points of the major items in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first crucial point is the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our Christ is all-inclusive.</S>

   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is even the real chair that you are sitting on, and the real glasses which you are wearing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is whatever we need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the all-inclusive One as the all-inclusive reality.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the banners for this conference speak about the all-inclusive Christ, who has the preeminence, the first place, in all things Col 1:18b .</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We want to give Him the first place in big things and in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, He has the preeminence in the Triune Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Godhead the preeminence goes to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Father always exalts the Son Phil 2:9 , and the Spirit always testifies concerning the Son John 15:26 , so even in the Triune Godhead, Christ has the preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell in Him bodily Col 2:9; 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Outside of Christ there is no God, because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit dwell in Him in a bodily way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Before He was incarnated, the fullness of the Godhead dwelt in Him as the eternal Word.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But once He became incarnate, clothed with a human body, the fullness of the Godhead, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, began to dwell in Him in a bodily way, and this fullness dwells in His glorified body Phil 3:21 now and forever.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ also has the preeminence in God's creation because He is the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15b .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is the preeminent One in the entire created universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Colossians shows us that all things were created in Him, in the power of His person, through Him as the active instrument through which the creation was processed, and unto Him for His possession 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ as God is the Creator, but also in God's eyes, when Christ was born as a man, He was the first item of all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He has the first place in the created universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In God's eyes to be the first is to be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no second in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is like the first Adam 1 Cor 15:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>All created men are included in the first Adam, so to be the first is to be everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means in the created universe, Christ is the reality of every positive thing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is the real sunshine, the real tree, the real grass, the real light, air, water, and food.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is everything we need to supply us and sustain us to carry out God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ is the Firstborn not only in the old creation but also in resurrection in God's new creation Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That means He has the preeminence in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because He is the first in the new creation, He is everything in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That means He is every man in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the new man, He as our life is all the members and is in all the members Col 3:4, 10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We all are the regenerated members of the new man, where Christ is all and in all.</S>
