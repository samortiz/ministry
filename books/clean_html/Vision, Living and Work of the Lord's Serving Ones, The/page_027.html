<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO KNOW THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew the Lord Jesus spoke of the church twice, first referring to the universal church, the Body of Christ, and later referring to the local church, the expression of the universal church in a locality. In leading new believers to know the church, we must first use 16:18, which speaks of the universal aspect of the church. Then we can use 18:17, which speaks of the local aspect of the church for our practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL POINTS IN LEADING BELIEVERS<br />
TO KNOW THE TRUTH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Speak</h2>
<p>In order for us to lead new believers to know the truth, there are several matters that require our attention. We first need to be trained in the way that we speak. When speaking the truth or conversing with others, we should have a proper demeanor and attitude. Often we are like students answering a teacher&rsquo;s questions. This training is to enable us to work, to serve, to minister the word to others, and to open their understanding. Therefore, when we speak concerning the truth, we must avoid the flavor of a student answering questions.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Giving a Deep Impression</h2>
<p>When we speak with others concerning spiritual matters, we must also give them a deep impression so that they can see a vision. We must lead them out of Jerusalem with its religious atmosphere to Caesarea Philippi, where the atmosphere is clear. We must impress the new believers that even though they do not know the truth, they can enter into the truth through our speaking. During the past eleven years we have had twenty-two Life-study trainings in America. After each message there is a time for sharing and also for testing. Sometimes the saints do not understand what I have said from the podium, but during the sharing everyone becomes clear. The saints who still do not understand become clear when the message is repeated during the testing. This is the way that the Lord uses the speaking of the brothers and sisters to enable everyone to see a vision.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Focusing on One Point</h2>
<p>When we speak the truth, we should not be afraid of repetition; rather, we should be afraid of digressing to different points. If we digress, the listeners will not be able to follow our point. When we speak on a certain truth, we should remember to focus only on that truth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE UNIVERSAL AND LOCAL ASPECTS<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Lord mentioned the church in the Gospels only twice, yet He presented both the universal aspect and the local aspect of the church in a wise way. The universal aspect of the church is seen in Matthew 16. According to this chapter, in order to see the vision of the universal church, we must have revelation. However, in order to have revelation, we must break away from the atmosphere, background, air, and flavor of religion; we must leave Jerusalem and come to Caesarea Philippi. Only when we are in Caesarea Philippi can we receive revelation to know who Christ is and what He has accomplished. Through the knowledge that we receive, we can experience Christ for the producing of the church. In verse 18 the Lord said, &ldquo;I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.&rdquo; Based on our knowledge of Christ, we can become a living stone, and the Lord will call us &ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;stone&rdquo; in Greek. Moreover, the Lord will build His church on this rock, that is, the revelation we have received concerning Christ. In verse 19 the Lord spoke of the kingdom: &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The kingdom is always related to spiritual warfare, and the result of warfare is the defeat of the gates of Hades. These words are simple, but they present the universal aspect of the church, which is the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>If we had only Matthew 16 without chapter 18, the truth concerning the church would be incomplete, because it would lack the local, practical aspect of the church. In chapter 18 the Lord showed the disciples how to maintain a good relationship among the brothers in the local church. This chapter deals with the expression of the church in a locality. When a problem cannot be resolved between two brothers, it must be told to the church. If the church does not have an expression in a locality, there will be no way for the brothers to be reconciled. The church being expressed in different localities is similar to the one unique moon being seen in many places on earth.</p>
<p>The relationship among the brothers is the background of the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in chapter 18. Today we are in the local churches. If the relationship among the brothers is not normal, there will be problems. The relationship among the brothers must be right for a local church to have a proper expression. If the relationship among the brothers is not right, there will be problems in the expression of a local church. In summary, the expression of the universal church depends on our knowledge and experience of Christ, whereas the expression of the church locally depends on our maintaining a normal relationship with one another. If we do not have Christ as our life, we are not regenerated, and if we do not have any knowledge and experience of Christ, it will be impossible for us to grow as members and constituents of the universal church. This is the truth in chapter 16. Chapter 18 says that even if we are in the universal church and know and experience Christ, without a proper relationship between the brothers in our locality, we are like Gentiles and tax collectors.</p>
<p>In chapter 18 the Lord shows how to maintain a proper relationship with the brothers in a local church. If this relationship is not maintained, we will not be in the local church life. With respect to the divine life, we are still in the universal church, but with respect to our relationship with the brothers, we will not be in the local church. The expression of the universal church in a locality depends on our maintaining a loving and honoring relationship among the brothers and the sisters. Eighty or ninety percent of this relationship depends on our saying, &ldquo;I am wrong. Please forgive me.&rdquo; We need to confess our mistakes to one another and forgive one another. If there is no confession, there will be no forgiveness, and the local expression of the church will fall apart.</p>
<p>In the church life some amount of friction among the saints is inevitable. If as a result of this friction we become offended and do not confess our mistakes, we will not have the practical living of a local church. The local church life is maintained by confessing to one another, forgiving one another, and forbearing one another. This is the proper church life. The Lord is very wise in His words. He said that the universal church depends on our receiving revelation and experiencing Christ, and the local church depends on our maintaining a proper relationship between the brothers and sisters.</p>
