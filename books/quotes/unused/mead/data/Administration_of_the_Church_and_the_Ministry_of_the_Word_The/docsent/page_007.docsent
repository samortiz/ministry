   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO PROBLEMS IN THE ADMINISTRATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD THE FIRST PROBLEM NOT HAVING A BURDEN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The greatest problem in the administration of the church and the ministry of the word is not having a burden or, we can say, not receiving a burden or not paying attention to a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is possible for elders to administrate the church without a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who minister the word may also do so without a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The discharge of our burden when we minister the word does not depend on how well we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our only desire is to speak well in order to touch people, our speaking will be without a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Likewise, an ability to administrate the church does not discharge one s burden.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not a matter of how well we can administrate but whether our administration is effective and can touch people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For example, when people come to a meeting, there may be the need to release the word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must seek the Lord concerning what we speak and concerning the issue of our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a matter of how well we speak, the logistics of our presentation, or whether the saints are touched; rather, it is a matter of what will be produced in the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If some are not yet saved, we should receive a burden to bear their souls by the Lord s grace to sow the seed of salvation into them when we release the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our burden is salvation, not the release of a dynamic word.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If they are saved but do not love the Lord, our burden should be for them to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If they love the Lord but are not willing to give themselves to the Lord and receive His dealing, our burden should be for them to willingly give themselves to the Lord and be dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the ministry of the word with a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, our Lord s Day message meeting may easily fall into the condition of the so-called Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every week someone is assigned to release a message in order to maintain the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the meeting, everyone goes home, eats lunch, rests, and returns in the evening for the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a Sunday service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this situation those who minister the word must receive a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to know the condition of those who come to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They might not have any feeling concerning their own condition, but we need to be clear and full of feeling concerning their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They may be able to sit and listen peacefully week after week, but we cannot speak peacefully week after week.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to receive the burden to disturb and trouble them so that even if they come to the meeting peacefully, they will be inwardly disturbed when they leave.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are not concerned that our speaking does not produce any effect in those who listen, we do not have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This situation indicates that those who speak and those who listen are in a routine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the condition of degraded Christianity where the congregation routinely listens to the pastor, and the pastor routinely preaches to the congregation year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This should not be our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ministry of the word should enlighten those who hear.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When we minister the word every Lord s Day, we should trouble people to the extent that they have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what it means to have a burden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If the listeners are lukewarm, even though they may listen peacefully, those who minister the word should not be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They should go before the Lord, and let Him take away their peace, even to the point of losing sleep and not eating until they receive a burden from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then their speaking will enable the Holy Spirit to work in the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only this kind of speaking is the speaking of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers who minister the word must have a burden, not merely doctrines, logic, and examples.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Ministering the word in this way is intolerable; it is an offense to God, and it is a sin in His eyes.</S>
