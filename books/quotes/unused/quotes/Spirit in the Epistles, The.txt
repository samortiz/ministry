We all know that here the Lord has two particular names one is Jesus which means Savior and the other is Emmanuel which means God with us
Please take notice that the book of Matthew, the first book of the Gospels, refers three times to the Lord's being with us
The second time is in the middle, where the Lord promised that whenever we are gathered into His name, He would be with us
They passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia
It says that Christ is in us because He is the Spirit, who was the Spirit of God but who is now the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of Jesus
Among the four Gospels, Matthew, a book on the kingdom, is a representative book, and John, a book on life, is also a representative book
The view of Matthew is from the angle of the seed of David, whereas the view of John is from the angle of the Son of God
John goes further to say that He is with us not only outwardly, to be in our midst, but also inwardly, to be with us forever
Matthew and John, however, specifically deal with the matter of the Lord's presence; therefore, the Lord cannot leave us
These two books both speak about the Lord's origin at the beginning and refer to the Lord's presence at the end
If you want to know the kingdom of God, you must know that there is One who was God and who became flesh to be the seed of David
He is with us not only momentarily but even constantly until the consummation of the age, when we will be with Him face to face
The Lord is God who became flesh so that He could be with us, but His ultimate purpose is to come into us to be with us inwardly
His being our Savior is for Him to be our life, and His being with us outwardly is for Him to come into us to be with us inwardly
Now you can understand that there is a prerequisite here, namely, that He had to die and enter into resurrection
Everyone knows that 1 Corinthians 15 is an important chapter that deals particularly with the matter of resurrection
Between the Gospels and the Epistles there is the book of Acts, which is a bridge that takes us from this bank to that bank
In the Gospels He is the Word, but after crossing the bridge of the Acts, on the bank of the Epistles He is the Spirit
Many Christians think that the Lord Jesus first ascended to heaven and then He was glorified; this is a wrong concept
One day this God who is Spirit became flesh to be a man and went through death and resurrection to become a life-giving Spirit
The white handkerchief and the blue handkerchief are not two handkerchiefs; they are one handkerchief in two stages
Originally He was the Spirit of God but after the Lords incarnation death and resurrection the Spirit of God became the lifegiving Spirit
John 12:24 says, 'Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit'
The grain of wheat has life, but unless it goes through death and grows forth again, it cannot impart its life into many grains
Dear brothers and sisters before His incarnation death and resurrection the Lord was life and in Him was life yet He could not give life
The Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of God, but praise the Lord, today we are not in the Old Testament, nor in the Gospels, nor in the Acts
Now you know that the Spirit in the New Testament Epistles is the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Today the Spirit of God is not merely the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Recently while visiting several local churches, we noticed that a certain locality was putting much emphasis on studying the Bible
At that very time, which was around the middle of the nineteenth century, a reaction arose, which was the Pentecostal movement
Of touching the Spirit in the Epistles, they touch the Spirit in Acts, and not only so, the way they take is not proper
Dear brothers and sisters, nothing can stop the Pentecostal movement as a counterfeit except the life-giving Spirit
You have speaking in tongues, interpreting of tongues, and healing, yet you are fleshly and you are infants in Christ
Dear brothers and sisters in the Epistles God wants us to leave the outward gifts and turn to the inner life which is the lifegiving Spirit
Because the church fell into a situation of empty rituals and empty doctrines of letters, the Pentecostal movement appeared
For if we being enemies were reconciled to God through the death of His Son much more we will be saved in His life having been reconciled
Being reconciled to God through the Lord's death is one thing and being saved in the Lord's life is another thing
On the negative side, we were saved through the Lord's death to be reconciled to God, thereby solving the problems between us and God
On the positive side, we are being saved in the Lord's life from the old creation and the natural being to enter fully into the glory of God
Not only so, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation
That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit
For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit
He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes for the saints according to God
We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose
The third matter is on how, by such a living, we may become living members to live the church life, the Body life
It speaks first about our salvation, then about our living in the Spirit, and then about our service and coordination in the Body
Our salvation is for us to live in the Spirit, and by living in the Spirit we become living members coordinating in the Body
The Lord Jesus, however, reconciled us to God by dying for us sinners and solving the problems between us and God
He is doing the work of sanctification to set us apart and make us holy so that we may be separated from all things and all worldly people
Our being saved in the life of the Lord allows Him to work in us to set us free to save us to transform us to sanctify us and to glorify us
The clause in the beginning of Romans 8:10, 'Christ is in you,' is a great word; it is the key to the entire book of Romans
Over the years, among the children of God many books were written concerning Romans, but the key to this book was never clearly pointed out
The most important thing which the Lord as the Spirit of life is doing in us is to release us from the law of sin and of death
If you set your mind on the flesh, the result will be death, but if you set your mind on the spirit, the result will be life and peace
When the mind stands with the spirit, this means that the mind is set on the spirit and the result is life and peace
Do not pay attention to your temper; rather, turn your mind back to focus on the spirit and to be set on the spirit
At this time we must see that we need to turn our mind back to focus on the spirit and to be set on the spirit
You must turn to the spirit within and not pay attention to yourself, your failures, your temper, or your flesh
Sometimes when you fall, when you are weak, and when you are far away from God, you think that perhaps God does not care about you anymore
Regardless of how weak you are as a Christian, often you still have the feeling that perhaps you should not do a certain thing
The more you pray, the more He causes you to be like the Son of God, to be conformed to the image of God's Son
We are not adopted sons; we are His real sons, who are born of Him and are growing by Him to be conformed to His image
It is true that by His mercy and grace we all are sons of God but if we look at ourselves today do we look like sons of God
If in the morning you pray to the Lord Jesus and cry, 'Abba, Father,' the whole day you will become more like a son of God
A sister may truly love the Lord, but she often may have such a 'long face' that it is too much for others to take
We may all look like people who are very good, but to this day we still do not sufficiently look like the sons of God
The more the life of the Son of God is ministered into us, the more we are being transformed and conformed into sons of God
Neither should you focus on your temper, because the more you focus on your temper, the worse your temper will be
You must heed the Spirit; then you will be enlivened within, and He will supply you within that you may have the reality of the Son of God
Although the enjoyment of the foretaste and the enjoyment of the full taste differ in measure, they are the same in nature
In Greek, in many passages where the Holy Spirit is mentioned, it is written as 'the Spirit, the Holy,' meaning that the Spirit is holiness
The reason is that Romans shows us that the salvation of God makes us, those who are fleshly and wicked, His divine sons
One day, after His death and resurrection, He was completely sanctified by the Spirit of holiness that was within Him
After His death and resurrection, He was transformed, sanctified, and designated to be the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness
Please remember that, in the book of Romans, chapter one mentions the Son of God and chapter eight mentions the sons of God
Finally, chapter fourteen says that the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit
In this uplifted, rejoicing spirit you have the overcoming life, the sanctified life, the spiritual life, the Body life, and the church life
Christ's coming into us means that the Spirit of Christ is in us, and this Spirit is the Spirit of life to supply, release, and rescue us
In summary, Romans shows us that the redeeming Christ, the Christ who died on our behalf, is in us today as the life-giving Spirit
He makes us, who were sons of wickedness, genuine sons of God, sons in name and in reality with His life and His image
As the many sons of God we become the living members coordinating together to become one Body for the expression of the God of glory
Christ is the blessed portion given to us by God, just as the land of Canaan was the blessed portion given to the children of Israel by God
Of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption
Corinthians chapter one is a strong chapter in the Bible which proves that Christ is not utterance, knowledge, gifts, signs, or wisdom
If you read the New Testament and the context of this passage in 1 Corinthians, you will see that these things denote Christ Himself
Not to mention that our eyes have not seen and our ears have not heard of this blessing, but even our hearts have never thought about it
The apostles were commissioned by God to preach Christ crucified, not signs required by the Jews or wisdom sought by the Greeks
Strictly speaking, however, 1 Corinthians mentions four kinds of people: the spiritual, the soulish, the fleshly, and the fleshy
Dear brothers and sisters, the Corinthians received so many gifts, yet the gifts could not make them spiritual
The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit, and this life-giving Spirit came into us and made us one spirit with Him
Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?
We must remember that Romans 12 says that we should present our bodies a living sacrifice to live the Body life
To glorify God in your body means on the one hand that you are joined to the Lord and on the other hand that you need to live the Body life
You have to realize that the spirit within you is joined to the Lord as one spirit, and therefore your body must be used by this spirit
What you eat is spiritual food, what you drink is spiritual drink, and what you depend upon is a spiritual rock
When you are baptized in the Spirit, you get into the Spirit, just as when you are baptized, you get into the water
The more spiritual a person is and the more he lives in the spirit, he is less clear and less conscious that he is in the spirit
If you read 1 Corinthians 7 again you will see that the more a person lives in spirit the more human he is in his living doing and speaking
We have a mistaken concept in thinking that if a person lives in spirit, he will be almost like an angel and be different from human beings
He said, 'Brother, do you know that if we dress ourselves in a less sophisticated way, we will have a greater impact?
If we dress ourselves in an uncommon and 'peculiar' manner and then give a spiritual message, people will be more inclined to follow us'?
Chapter ten tells us that our spiritual enjoyment, spiritual food, spiritual drink, and spiritual dependence all should be in the spirit
On the one hand, we have been baptized in one Spirit, and on the other hand, we are drinking of one Spirit day by day
Although we need the proper outpouring of the Spirit, the outward pouring out is for the inward receiving and taking in
Of asking for the outpouring of the Spirit day by day, we should receive, take in, the Spirit from within moment by moment
God has baptized us into the Spirit as the living water, and He has also made us to drink of this living water
We should eat Him as our spiritual food, drink Him as our spiritual drink, and depend upon Him as our spiritual rock
Following the book of Romans, 1 Corinthians shows us that God has given Christ to us to be our portion and our everything
When we experience Him in this way, we grow and are transformed so that we are built up together to be the temple of God
When you live in this Spirit, you become very human, and you may not even feel very much that you are in the spirit
He is the ointment to anoint us; second, He is the seal to impress us; and third, He is the pledge to guarantee to us
When you apply any kind of ointment to an object, the more you apply, the more the element of the ointment is added to the object
As the pledge, He guarantees that all the fullness of the Godhead is our portion for our enjoyment and application
In Romans and 1 Corinthians there are no words referring to the anointing, the sealing, the pledging, or the inscribing
By this you can see that just chapter three of 2 Corinthians alone has added a number of different expressions
It is neither a matter of how many messages you preach concerning Christ nor a matter of how many things you speak about Christ
Rather, it is a matter of the exercise of the spirit, the release of the spirit, and the going forth of the spirit
The same word for transformed is also used in Romans 12:2, which says, 'Be transformed by the renewing of the mind'
The Spirit as the pledge in us and as the firstfruit for our enjoyment and foretaste is for our transformation
The Chinese, after being in America three or four generations, are still full of the Chinese 'smell'; they have not changed at all
After living in America all these years, you have not changed a bit but have remained Chinese brothers and Chinese sisters
You should allow Christ to have the ground in you and come out of you so that you may be gradually transformed
The problems of the brothers and sisters, as well as the problems of the church, all arise out of the mind, emotion, and will
God's redemption consists of three steps: regeneration in the spirit, transformation in the soul, and transfiguration in the body
By the Holy Spirit's anointing, sealing, supplying, inscribing, and releasing in us to saturate every part of our soul with Christ
Philippians 1:27 says, 'You stand firm in one spirit, with one soul striving together along with the faith of the gospel'
In such a complicated situation, how can everything be according to your feeling and fit the taste of your emotions?
It is not a matter of right or wrong, nor is it a matter of likes or dislikes, but a matter of returning to the spirit
The man who takes the spirit as the life and the faculties of the soul as the instrument needs to be renewed day by day
After the renewing of the soul, your mind will become more useful because it will be a renewed, uplifted, and broadened mind
The source of this grace is the love of God, and the transmission of this grace is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Love is the source of grace, grace is the expression of love, and through fellowship grace is transmitted to us
The source of electricity is electricity, the current of electricity is electricity, and electricity itself is electricity
The sequence of the books of the Bible is very meaningful, and we believe it is the arrangement of the Holy Spirit
In Romans we see how the Spirit of sonship carries out a sanctifying work in us so that we may have the image of God's Son
The first concept given to us in Galatians is that it pleased God to reveal His Son in us, to put His Son in us
Chapter two says the Son of God has not only been put in us, but He is also living in us, and we are living by His faith
Just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now
We have the matter of being born according to the Spirit, which means the same thing as being born of the Spirit in John 3
Whereas Galatians 4:29 says, 'Born according to the Spirit,' here in 4:6 it says that God has sent 'the Spirit of His Son' into our hearts
Not only so, this Spirit also includes the human element, the effectiveness of Christ's death, and the power of resurrection
Today we must see that the Holy Spirit is not only a person, but that He also incorporates the Father and the Son
When this Spirit comes in, forgiveness of sins, redemption, justification, peace, life, comfort, power, and light come in
The apostle wrote the book of Galatians with a strong intention to break down the Galatians' concept of keeping the law
You think that it would be good if you could succeed, but the Lord considers that it would be good if you fail
For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life
Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness
In this way we afford the Spirit the opportunity to spread from within us so that every part of our being is filled with the Spirit
Since the mind, which is the leading part of the soul, has the Spirit, the emotion and will also will have the Spirit
The book of Galatians shows us, on the negative side, that we should not keep the law, that we have died to the law
The Lord Jesus said, 'If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me'
As long as you are willing to put your self on the cross, the Lord Jesus as the living Spirit will have the ground in you
Unless we know the Spirit and live in the Spirit, everything we say about Christ is doctrinal, not experiential
In church history there was a group of people, the so-called Brethren, who had a great many discussions and writings concerning the church
It is a pity that they have become doctrines because their emphasis is merely on the objective aspect of the church
Some of them care only for studying the Bible and learning the doctrines, while others pay attention to rituals and ordinances
Their reasoning is based solely on the book of Acts, without caring for the other aspect revealed in the Gospel of John
The western part of Texas, where one of the brother's hometown is, is famous in the world for its cotton production
The cotton fields there do not depend on the rain from heaven, yet they have an abundant harvest yearly because they never lack water
Oh, brothers and sisters, there is also a river flowing richly within us Christians, yet we neglect it and are ignorant of it
At the end of the New Testament, it is still John's message that shows us a river of water of life proceeding from the throne
The more you pray, the deeper your digging is, and the result is that the living water within you will flow out
The word Holy is a particularly emphasized word, which is impossible to translate directly not only into Chinese but also into English
According to the original meaning, the proper rendering for the Holy Spirit here should be the Spirit the Holy
The two passages above give us the overall subject matter: how the Holy Spirit of God is in us as the seal and the pledge
After being asked such a question, many become confused and are not clear whether they have received the Holy Spirit
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him
Many times we listen to messages, read spiritual books, and study the Bible by our mind, so there is no revelation
The more we debate about doctrine, the more we are separated; the more we debate, the greater the distance between us
The fluorescent lamps in a room are separated outwardly, but they are joined in the electrical current to become one entity
That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man
For this reason the apostle Paul prayed that God would strengthen our spirit with His Spirit to make our spirit strong
At this stage the Spirit is no longer only in our spirit but has spread into our mind to become the spirit of the mind
When the spirit occupies the mind, the will, and the emotion, this means that the mind, the will, and the emotion are filled with the spirit
The word spirit here does not have a definite article; it denotes neither the Holy Spirit nor our spirit in a definite way
Now we need to let this spirit spread into every part of our being so that our entire being is filled with the spirit
When you are occupied by and filled with the Spirit, you are equipped to fight the spiritual battle for the Lord
When you turn to your spirit, you have the light and revelation concerning the church, the revelation concerning the mystery of Christ
When you are strengthened, you are renewed; when you are renewed, you are filled; when you are filled, you are equipped to fight
For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh
Galatians tells us that Christ is our life, Christ is revealed in us, Christ lives in us, and Christ is being formed in us
Please remember that Galatians merely speaks about Christ as life, but it does not show us how to experience Christ
The apostle said that whether through life or through death he was bold, as always, to have Christ magnified in his body
He also said that he had learned, in whatever circumstances he was, to be content and that he could do all things in Christ
Whether in life or in death, whether in poverty or in wealth, whether in abasement or in exaltation, in whatever circumstance, He supplies
Forget about your husband; do not care about being persecuted, nor try to reason with him, nor look for an outward remedy
After such a contact, your husband's persecution may still be there, but you do not sense the hardship because you are transcendent
He is the Spirit who suffered persecution and the Spirit who passed through death and entered into resurrection
If we want to manifest Christ, we must not forget the preaching of the gospel, and we must preach by exercising the spirit
For Christ to be magnified in any circumstance we need to preach the gospel to sinners by exercising our spirit
We also need to instruct them how to make a list of the names of their relatives friends neighbors colleagues and any other acquaintances
We need to train the brothers and sisters how to have gospel visitations and bring the ones who have believed to be baptized in the church
You should not have the notion that since you pursue Christ and know Christ, you can neglect the preaching of the gospel
In 1949 when we were in Shanghai, almost all the brothers and sisters had some gospel tracts with them wherever they went
If we earnestly preach our Lord from our spirit to the sinners, then we are those who truly know Christ and truly manifest Christ
There are two or three brothers who are simple-minded, and even though they are not good with words, they are burning in spirit
Preaching the gospel is not a matter of exercising our intellect but a matter of exercising our spirit to touch others' spirit
Dear brothers and sisters, the power of the gospel lies not with the good presentation of the truth but with the release of the spirit
If you are bustling in your mind but cold in your spirit, even though you are able to present the truth clearly, no one will be saved
In preaching the gospel, first, we must have 'thick skin'; second, we must have a simple mind; and third, we must have a burning spirit
We should not set up a spiritual standard and have fellowship only with those who can come up to that standard
Dear brothers and sisters, history tells us that those who maintain a special fellowship eventually become 'childless old people'
Our understanding is for us to understand God's will, which is concerning Christ, the church, and the mystery of God
After you received the gospel in this way, God has given to you 'the Spirit the Holy,' that is, His Holy Spirit
That He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all His saints
In the Old Testament, especially in the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah, the Spirit of God is always called the Spirit of Jehovah
It was not formally used until the mention in Luke 1 and Matthew 1 concerning the Lord Jesus incarnation and His being conceived in a virgin
Now God was to be incarnated through this Spirit that He might make the unholy created men holy and bring them into holiness
You may remember that in the Old Testament, the boards in the tabernacle were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold
The basic principle of incarnation is that 'the Spirit the Holy' of God entered into the unholy man to make him holy
After the incarnated God entered into death and also into resurrection, His Spirit had a new title, that is, the life-giving Spirit
It was at this time that the incarnated God became the life-giving Spirit, because He had passed through death and resurrection
His death solved all the problems between man and God, and His resurrection released the life that was within Him
He comes to make unholy man into holy man, that is, to make the man who is without the divine nature into a man with the divine nature
Romans 8 is a story of resurrection in which not only the spirit is made alive, but even the mortal body is also made alive
The life-giving Spirit' refers to the function of the Spirit, whereas 'the Spirit of Jesus Christ' is the title of the Spirit
It was not until the eighteenth century that John Wesley and his companions began to stress the matter of holiness
At that time, however, they could be considered to have recovered only the term holiness but not the reality of holiness
The holiness taught by John Wesley and his co-workers was one which required people to live a life of sinless perfection
They all teach the doctrine of holiness, which is to behave properly without mistakes, as taught by John Wesley
From this, the Church of the Nazarene also emerged, and we may say that it strictly follows the teachings of John Wesley
Many people think that most of the Christian women in America curl their hair, wear make-up, and are very fashionable
Cowman, who wrote the book Streams in the Desert, and her husband founded the Far East Missionary Society and worked mostly in Japan
From the Scriptures they learned that the meaning of the word holiness does not emphasize purity but separation
They pointed out that the sanctification referred to in many passages in the Bible has no bearing on being without sin or without evil
They cannot; however, when milk and bread are on the table, they are common if they have not passed through the Christians' prayers
Brothers and sisters, over thirty years ago when we spoke about sanctification, we taught the same doctrine that was taught by the Brethren
As we studied the Bible again, we gradually learned that the word sanctification does not merely mean separation
In these recent years we have seen that we cannot truly say that sanctification does not include the meaning which John Wesley taught
Sanctification is not only a matter of being delivered from sin or being separated unto God but also a matter of being made holy
The sanctification taught by the Brethren is only separation, and it is really only positional separation and not dispositional separation
Today, however, the sanctification which we speak about is not only a positional change but also a dispositional change
When you take the gold out of the shops or homes and place it in the temple, this is merely a positional change
In 2 Thessalonians, in the phrase sanctification of the Spirit, the word sanctification refers to the effect of the Spirit
We thank God that eventually we will have not only the Spirit of holiness but also the Spirit's sanctification!
At the beginning we only have the Spirit of holiness coming into us, but eventually we will be sanctified by this Spirit
Obviously it was Paul speaking there because he said clearly that he was giving his opinion without having a commandment from the Lord
When the Spirit of Jehovah came to, or descended upon, Jeremiah, he began to speak, 'I, Jehovah, say this and that'
Consequently, it was Paul speaking, it was Paul writing to the saints in Corinth, and it was Paul commanding and speaking
If you listen carefully to their words or expressions, you will notice that they are words found either in Isaiah or in Jeremiah
In the time of the degradation of the church, the apostle Paul wrote a letter with this phrase: 'The Spirit says expressly'
Rather, it is the Spirit of life who dwells in us and who has been mingled with our spirit into one spirit speaking within us
Timothy 1:7 says, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness'
It is wonderful that the Lord's word shows us that God has given us a spirit not only of power but also of love and of sobermindedness
We need this kind of a spirit, a spirit with power, love, and sobermindedness, a spirit which is sober in love and loving in power
Only this kind of spirit is adequate for dealing with a confused situation and can meet the need of a degraded condition
In the church's degradation we need such a guarding Spirit to guard the deposit in us today of the things which we received in the past
From your reading you can see that He is the indwelling Spirit who dwells in your spirit to make your spirit strong loving and soberminded
The result of this outpouring is that we have been justified by His grace to become heirs according to the hope of eternal life
In order to experience enjoy and fully taste the grace of the Lord we must know the Spirit because the grace of the Lord is in our spirit
The word spoken by the Holy Spirit here in Hebrews is different from the word spoken by the Spirit in 1 Timothy 4:1
Whatever is spoken by 'the Spirit the Holy,' whatever is purely the word spoken by God, is a quotation from the Old Testament
The word in 1 Timothy 4:1 is a subjective word; it is the feeling given to us from within by the Spirit who is mingled with us as one spirit
In 1 Timothy 4:1, however, when the subjective Spirit speaks in us a subjective word, He does not quote from the Old Testament
Whenever the subjective word is spoken, it is the Holy Spirit mingled with our spirit as one spirit-the subjective spirit-who speaks
That is a feeling that we have from deep within and not a word quoted or a figure taken from the Old Testament
When it quotes from the Old Testament, it does not do so like the other Epistles by saying that it is a word spoken by Isaiah or by Jeremiah
Those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit
These are the three aspects of the Spirit in Hebrews: the speaking Spirit, the Spirit of grace , and the eternal Spirit
We need to read Hebrews 9:14, which says that Christ offered Himself without blemish to God through the eternal Spirit
His one offering accomplished redemption eternally because He died not only in the flesh but also in the eternal Spirit
In other words, you can understand the things of God which are in the realm of eternity only in the eternal Spirit
If you learn to always get out of your mind and turn to your spirit, your spirit will be freed from the restriction of your little mind
Once you fall into the mind, your understanding becomes bound, confined in every way, and is unable to comprehend
Once you reject your mind and get into your spirit, you become like one who has soared into space; you are released
416 says to come forward to the throne of grace which is the cover of the ark which was within the Holy of Holies in the Old Testament time
We know that both with the ark and with the temple, there are three sections: the outer court, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies
God dispenses grace to man, meets with man, and fellowships with man at the throne of grace, that is, in Christ
Today when we want to use electricity, we do not need to go to the power plant; we can use it right where we are
If the eternal Spirit were not in us, then the Holy of Holies in the heavens would not be connected to us within
Today the speaking Spirit, who is also the Spirit as our enjoyment and the unlimited, eternal Spirit, is in our spirit
Manna is for the childish Christians, the wandering Christians, and the Christians who are still living in their soul
At times a sister may feel that she has been wronged, so she goes to the elders to bring a charge against her husband
Once she did that, she entered the Holy of Holies and touched the throne of grace to receive mercy and obtain grace for timely help
The New Testament believers may be just like them, wandering outside of the Holy of Holies and never entering into the rest to enjoy Christ
If we do not turn to the spirit, we will be wandering in the wilderness of our soul and not entering into the rest
For this reason, these verses say that you must divide the spirit from the soul and that you must not remain in the soul
In the Old Testament only the High Priest could enter into the Holy of Holies but today every saved person can enter into the Holy of Holies
He desires that you enter into the Holy of Holies, to come forward to the throne of grace, to receive mercy and obtain grace for timely help
Once you turn to the spirit, you can overcome, you are in the heavens, and you are in the Lord's Holy of Holies
Christ is with you and once you touch His throne of grace His mercy and grace will flow as the living waters to water you continually within
Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: 'The Spirit, whom He has caused to dwell in us, longs to envy'?
According to the thought of the entire book and the immediate context, we agree that it is one sentence, as shown in the paragraph above
The Spirit who dwells in us longs for us to love God and to turn toward Him to such an extent that He has an envying heart inside us
In such a living, the first requirement is that we love God absolutely just as a wife loves her husband absolutely
You cannot find it anywhere in the Old Testament, but the entire Old Testament definitely reveals such a thought
In these four books, God tells the children of Israel that they were wedded to Him as a wife, but they were not faithful to Him
Verse 15 of chapter three says, 'This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but is earthly, soulish, demonic'
The crucifixion was accomplished two thousand years ago, but its efficacy is eternal, not being subject to time
Even in the Old Testament, the Spirit of Christ was in the prophets to enable them to understand the prophecies concerning Christ
The last verse in Ephesians 2 says, 'In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit'
The three parts of the soul-mind, emotion, and will-plus the conscience, which is a part of the spirit, make up the heart
If you want your mind, emotion, and will to be proper, you must deal with them from the source, from your spirit in your deepest part
Many times when you cannot quiet down it is not a matter involving your mind emotion or will rather it is because your spirit is in turmoil
We all know that when our spirit is agitated, our mind, emotion, and will are easily excited and are difficult to calm down
If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you
When Stephen was martyred, his face was transfigured to resemble the face of an angel; that was the glory of God being manifested
With the martyrs, usually at the moment they suffered martyrdom, there was a condition showing that God was expressed
It turned out that she was a Christian who had been captured by the Boxers, and they were taking her off to execute her
Christians are not like this because the indwelling Spirit, who is also the Spirit of glory, rests upon them to manifest the glory of God
The element of God is like paint, and the moving of the Holy Spirit within us is like someone painting a piece of furniture
We understand God's will and God's leading not by an explicit word in letters but through the inward anointing
When the Lord Jesus was born in the flesh, the Holy Spirit came upon Mary so that the holy thing which she bore was called the Son of God
When the Lord Jesus was baptized in the water, as He came up from the water, there was a voice saying, 'This is My beloved Son'
When the Lord Jesus died on the cross and shed His blood, the centurion also testified and said, 'Truly this was the Son of God'
Regardless of whether it was His birth, His baptism, or His death, they all testified that He is the Son of God
They are soulish living in the soul and walking according to the soul so their spirits cannot be seen in them or in their living and actions
We must know that the visions or revelations in the book of Revelation are shown in these four times of being 'in spirit'
The first time the apostle John was in spirit he saw the seven golden lampstands and the Lord who walks in the midst of them
The second time, he saw a throne in heaven out of which the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls were executed
The third time, he saw Babylon the harlot, which is in chapters seventeen and eighteen and which includes also chapters nineteen and twenty
Revelation can be divided into four sections, covering four great visions, all of which were seen by John in spirit
The seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls are all God's judgment, and God's judgment is His administration
In the book of Revelation the Spirit of God is called the seven Spirits because in this book the Spirit of God is the administrating Spirit
With respect to the throne of God, He is the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne and shining on the entire universe
These seven lamps of fire are the seven Spirits of God, and these seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb
With regard to the seven lamps before the throne, they are the seven eyes of the Lamb, and these seven eyes are the seven Spirits
These seven eyes are the expression and manifestation of the Lamb, just as your eyes are your expression and manifestation
Here in Revelation it is God on the throne in the Lamb coming forth in His Spirit to execute His will for His administration in the universe
God's administration in the church is His coming forth, and God's administration in the universe is also His coming forth
Here in the book of Revelation, the words coming out of the mouth of the Lord Jesus are not words of grace but words of judgment
We need the Spirit as the living water flowing in us, but we also need the Spirit as fire shining, searching, judging, and burning in us
The word spoken by the bride, the church, is the word spoken by the Spirit, and the Spirit speaks through the bride, the church
The Spirit of the Lord today is the seven Spirits as the expression of the Lord Himself to enlighten us, search us, judge us, and burn us
God can only be our God in this Spirit, so He is the God of our spirits, the God of the spirits of the prophets
You take the word which you have read and understood and turn it into spirit, and it is in spirit that you will see the visions
According to our natural sentiments, we enjoy listening to doctrinal teachings, and we also like performing rituals
From the time of the Reformation with Luther, the reality of redemption has been recovered; there is no question about this
Today no one can take away justification by faith from Christians because this matter has already been recovered into the Christian life
They have no experience whatsoever of justification by faith, yet they preach the doctrine of justification by faith
What we are afraid of today is that the truths concerning matters such as redemption and life have become doctrines without the reality
Satan's destruction is to damage us, the vessels of God, so that we are no longer fit to be used by God as His vessels
We see that the Triune God is Spirit to be received by us and that within us we have a spirit created and regenerated by Him
That we can become one spirit with the Lord proves that originally there was not one spirit but two spirits to be joined together
At the outset Matthew shows us the genealogy of the Lord, which can be considered almost a sketch of the entire Old Testament
Still another time, after the Lord's resurrection, it says, 'I am with you all the days until the consummation of the age'
Rather they show us how this One who was God with man the incarnated One and Emmanuel lived in man and how He lived out the living of a man
John's emphasis is to show us that this God who was in the beginning came into the world to become a man and then went to the cross
In chapters fourteen through sixteen there is a great turning point, where the Lord was transfigured from the flesh into the Spirit
At the end of the Gospel of John, in chapters twenty and twenty-one, this wonderful One was eventually manifested as a breath
The Gospel of John is a record showing that the Triune God is mingled with a descendant who came out of the fathers
Such a One is too marvelous, and this wonderful One eventually became a breath, which is the Spirit for us to receive
When one believes in a religion, one believes some teachings or doctrines, but when we believe in the Lord Jesus, we take Him in as a breath
Such a One lived on the earth and then finally through death and resurrection He became a breath for man to breathe in and to receive
All these things are right, but we hardly ever touched the central point, which is that the Lord Jesus became breath for man to breathe in
It is true that when we were speaking about how He was so merciful and so generous as the Spirit He was also working along with our speaking
While you are preaching the word, there may be a thousand people listening to you, but only five or six will truly receive help and be saved
They may forget the words they heard, but they will never forget the fact that they have contacted and gained the Lord within them
When people come into our midst, it should not be for listening to the objective word but for breathing the Lord with their spirit
When people come into our midst, their feeling, inclination, and desire should not be that they come because there are good messages here
Rather, there should be a certain kind of atmosphere, a certain kind of spirit, that enables others to breathe God and to gain God
Until now the emphasis in our preaching has been on the objective word, but from now on it should be on the spirit
We should present the real things before others, and in our presentation our spirit must also go forth to touch their spirit
We hope that from now on the emphasis of our preaching in every locality will not be on giving a message for people to listen to
We must help the brothers and sisters to have an atmosphere in which they pray much and their spirits are living
They also said that they are even preaching the gospel by pray-reading and that the attendance has increased and many have been saved
Although we have the word, the word is simply an explanation that enables people to breathe in and touch the fresh air from heaven
As far as man is concerned, the physical members are merely the external things; only the life within him is his center
It has to cover many different matters because without them there is no place in which to put its life and its spirit
Many saints throughout the centuries interpreted the Gospels, but they only talked about the external, superficial things
We cannot say that this is wrong, but you must realize that this is not the center or the conclusion of the Gospels
It was not the Lord ascending to the throne; instead, it was the Lord becoming a breath being breathed into men
There are very many expositions of Romans, but it is amazing that you can hardly find one that points out the spirit of Romans
Whether it is his commentary on Galatians or on Romans, Luther points out only the matter of justification by faith in those two books
Justification by faith surely is a great item in the book of Romans, but it is not the soul of the book of Romans
These peripheral things have become veils that prevent Bible readers from seeing the spirit, the life, of the book
The spirit mentioned in the first place is the Spirit of God, whereas the spirit mentioned here in the second place refers to Paul's spirit
There it says that what God wants is not the outward service in form and letter but the inward service in spirit
Why does it say that we should serve God in our spirit and that our service today is not in letter but in spirit?
It is clear that 1:4 refers to the Spirit of God, and it is equally clear that 1:9 refers to the spirit of man
Eventually we just have to accept the fact that this is the mingled spirit, which is the mingling of two spirits
It is the Spirit of God as well as the spirit of man, and it is the spirit of man as well as the Spirit of God
No doubt, it seems that redemption is a matter outside of us; it is a matter accomplished for us by God outside of us
He says that we 'rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation'
The first half of Romans, which is also the first major part, ends with rejoicing in God, boasting in God, and taking God as our enjoyment
The first section deals with redemption, the second section deals with life, and the third section deals with the Body
Romans 5:10 says that since we were reconciled to God through the death of God's Son, much more we will be saved in His life
Verse 11 says that since we have been reconciled to God, we are now enjoying God, and God has become our enjoyment
The second half of chapter five begins to deal with the matter of life, even to such an extent that it says that we are reigning in life
It is only when you are in this life that death, burial, and resurrection can become your subjective experience
Eventually however because what they taught were mere doctrines those who listened to them did not experience death burial or resurrection
That day when he came out from his fellowship with the Lord and went to contact people, the humility seen in him was his newness in life
Sometimes when you meet certain brothers and sisters, you feel that they are good and faultless, yet they look so old
The Chinese Union Version renders this term into 'the Spirit who gives life,' as if life and the Spirit are two entities
Prior to chapter five, the book of Romans tells us that Christ is our Redeemer; in other words, Christ is our redemption
After all, like the Gospel of John, the book of Romans speaks about the story of the Spirit entering into man's spirit
It is not necessary for you to love others, to do good deeds, to reform your character, to improve your behavior, or to struggle and strive
Verse 26 of chapter eight mentions another point: The Spirit is doing a particular thing in us, that is, interceding for us
God's desire is that we would be conformed to the image of His Son, and it is for this that the Spirit who dwells in our spirit is groaning
Brothers and sisters, you need to see clearly that Romans is the first book of the Epistles and its kernel, its essence, is the spirit
From 5:10 on, the book turns from redemption to life, showing us that the redeeming Christ is the Spirit of life today
As those who have been redeemed by Christ, we were forgiven of our sins, we are no longer under condemnation, and we are saved
If you pour the orange juice slowly into the water, then the water will gradually turn yellow, and eventually it is 'yellowed'
The life we have is the life of the Body; the more this life grows in us, the more we will grow together as one
The salvation carried out by this life eventually will save us from being independent so that we may become one Body
If you want to experience Him as the Spirit of life, you must know your spirit and learn to discern the spirit from the soul
For a person to be saved, the most important thing is not for his spirit to be moved but for his mind to be opened
You will cause people's minds to be opened to God, and the light of God will be able to shine into their spirit through their mind
Ordinarily when we say we struggle and strive by ourselves, in reality, it simply means that our mind intends to act independently
We feel that we must please God, so we use our mind to focus on how to behave well, how to do good works, and how to keep God's commandments
Todays Christians do not try to keep Gods law as Paul did when he was under the law but they still try to use their mind to do good things
After hearing a message with our mind, we may feel that it is a good message and we are deeply moved, so we consider how to work it out
Please remember that the experience in Romans 7 is the experience of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
Even when he is very touched after hearing a good message or reading an excellent portion of the Word, his mind is not set on the message
Romans 8 is a real salvation because the soul is no longer independent but rather is dependent, relying, and set on the spirit
Dear brothers and sisters, this is the secret to our experiencing the Lord Jesus as the Spirit of life and His subjective salvation in life
We need to set our mind on the spirit, continually be joined with the spirit as one, and never be detached from the spirit
Many Christians have the concept that our prayer is to receive power from the Lord so that the Lord's power can help us to overcome
The more you pray, the more your mind is turned back; hence, it becomes less an independent mind and more a dependent mind
The Spirit within you begins to carry out the saving work for you to be set free, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and blended
The key to experiencing the subjective salvation of the Lord as the Spirit of life within us is to set our mind on the spirit
Today, however, we have seen clearly that the key to our cooperating with the Lord is to learn to set our mind on the spirit continually
It does not matter if the machines are a little dirty; as long as they are connected to the electricity, they work
On the subjective side, they first deal with the exercise of our spirit, and second, with setting our mind on the spirit
You simply must set your mind continually on your spirit, then the two are connected, and once the connection is made, salvation is here
We need to listen to messages and read the Bible, because listening to messages and reading the Scriptures can transform our mind
He needs to continue listening to messages and reading the Scriptures without subjectivity, so that the mind may be renewed
In this way he gradually feels that his previous concept was wrong because what God wants is not individual spirituality but the Body
He said that he had a feeling that when the sisters do not pray in the meetings, it is as if the church is paralyzed
How can it be God's intention that the sisters should not make any sound, not even sounds of praise, in the meetings'!
We need to turn and study more of the Lord's words in the Bible so that our mind may be renewed and transformed
The first stage is an independent mind, the second stage is a dependent mind, and the third stage is a transformed mind
If the brothers are all in this, and you also help the saints in various localities to be in this way, then the churches will be burning
If you read Philippians, clearly there were some who did not take the way of the apostles and yet they also preached Christ
At that time, like the Pentecostals today, the believers in Corinth emphasized gifts and especially stressed speaking in tongues
When a person comes to read the Scriptures, he is frequently hindered by the superficial things and is thus unable to see the inner things
When someone reads 1 Corinthians 1, he is easily blinded by the words concerning not being divisive; he sees division but not Christ
What God gives us is neither philosophy, nor religion, nor miraculous power, nor knowledge, nor wisdom; what God gives us is Christ Himself
In order to experience this Christ, first we must realize that this Christ is Spirit and He is also in the Spirit
We must also know that as the Spirit He dwells in our spirit, and if we want to experience and enjoy Him, we must come back to our spirit
Verse 14 in chapter two says, 'But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him'
In verse 2 the apostle says, 'I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified'
We see there are two kinds of men: the soulish man who lives according to the soul and the spiritual man who lives according to the spirit
Today if we want to experience this Christ and enter into His fellowship, we must realize that this is altogether a story in the spirit
You should not be afraid of repeating the same message, thinking that there is no need to repeat a message after it has been given
After 1 Corinthians chapter one mentions that Christ is our portion, chapter two immediately touches the matter of the spirit
By reading 3:16 and 6:17 together you will naturally understand that the indwelling Spirit is the Lord Himself
For this reason the apostle Paul went on to say that if we want to know and experience this Christ, we need to be those who are in spirit
It is speaking about Christ, the God-given portion, who is the indwelling Spirit and who lives now in our spirit
In order to participate in Him, have fellowship with Him, experience Him, and enjoy Him, we need to turn to our spirit
You live in the flesh, and therefore you are liable to commit fornication and to bring a lawsuit against a brother
At any rate, in 1 Corinthians we see three kinds of men: the fleshy and fleshly man, the soulish man, and the spiritual man
In chapter five we already passed through the Passover and are no longer in Egypt, and in chapter nine we are in the wilderness
You should not remain in the flesh to dispute with one another, nor should you remain in the soul to pay attention exclusively to the gifts
The first background is the Israelites' exodus from Egypt, going through the wilderness, and entering into Canaan
He also said that they had already kept the Passover and had left Egypt, and now they were running in the wilderness
They have to go to the spirit to meet Christ there, because Christ is the Canaan which God has prepared for us today
Although we still have the flesh, we do not live according to the flesh; the flesh becomes insignificant to us
Although we are persons who still have the flesh and the soul, we all live in the spirit and according to the spirit
It is a pity that today when people see these background drawings, they cling to them and cannot go on to see the central matters
They can present clearly and reasonably, by quoting Scripture verses, the matters of lawsuits, excommunication, and idol sacrifices
If we want to see this, however, we must see the flesh and deny the soul; we must not live in the flesh or in the soul
The third possibility is that we are in the Holy Place, touching the matters of the spirit but not the spirit itself
In the New Testament there are two books that tell us to enter into Canaan; one is 1 Corinthians and the other is Hebrews
These two books tell us to live in the spirit, and only these two books repeatedly speak about the discerning of the spirit from the soul
Corinthians mentions the soulish man and the spiritual man, while Hebrews speaks about the dividing of soul and spirit
We will then be fully delivered out of the old creation, and we will be fully filled with Him within and without
Although all are saved ones and all are Israelites some are in Egypt some are wandering in the wilderness and some have entered into Canaan
Following 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians goes on to speak altogether about how a person lives in the Holy of Holies, in the spirit
2 Corinthians 12 clearly shows us, with an illustration, that Paul had a thorn in his flesh which caused much suffering to him
In the sixty-six books of the Scriptures there is a portion which tells us that the Lord will not listen to this kind of prayer
Remember that in the sixty-six books of the Bible only this one portion tells us that God wants to tear us down
Verse 16 of chapter four says, 'Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day'
A thorn which came by the permission of the Lord and which was Satan's messenger, consumed Paul, causing him to enter the Holy of Holies
The book of 1 Corinthians shows us such a picture to encourage us to enter into the spirit and to live by the spirit
2 Corinthians shows us what kind of persons are those who live in the spirit, who live in the Holy of Holies, and who remain in Canaan
Not trusting in ourselves does not refer to not trusting in ourselves to transact business, to pursue education, or to seek pleasure
To not trust in ourselves is to be in the Holy of Holies, while to trust in ourselves is to be in the Holy Place
Jacob was a very capable person who had so many ways before the socket of his hip was touched and he was crippled
After he crossed over the ford of the Jabbok, the socket of his hip was touched by God; at that point he became simple
It was not until this time that he experienced how God had anointed him and had given the Spirit in him as a pledge
It was in the depths, in the Holy of Holies, that he experienced God's anointing ointment and the Spirit as a pledge
What you experience is the Spirit Himself and not merely the working, the moving, the power, or the gift of the Spirit
We stand on the same level with the Lord Jesus; we negotiate with Him and deal with Him as if doing business transactions
Romans 8 shows us only that we must walk according to the Spirit and that the Spirit is in us praying and groaning for us
2 Corinthians 3 shows us that the Spirit within us is the letter-writing Spirit, who writes Christ into us over and over again
In Romans 8 the experience of the Spirit within us is at the initial stage, while in 2 Corinthians 3 it has reached the peak
A certain brother may have enjoyed wonderful fellowship with the Lord in the last two days, so he is very meek and humble
We see a person who is living continually in the Holy of Holies, being written upon by God and constituted by the Spirit
You have to go further and see that today the Spirit in us who is constituting us and writing on us is the Lord Himself
If you say that the Spirit here is not the Holy Spirit, then this means that besides the Holy Spirit there is another Spirit
The Bible tells us that the Lord Jesus lives in you, and the Bible also says that the Holy Spirit lives in you
On the one hand, the Bible says that the Son is the Father, and on the other hand, it says that the Lord is the Spirit
According to your shallow experience you may feel that the Lord Jesus is in the heavens while the Holy Spirit is here on earth inspiring you
Just as 'the Father God' denotes that the Father and God are one, so 'the Lord Spirit' also denotes that the Lord and the Spirit are one
Today it is the Lord Spirit who is working in us because it is the Lord Spirit who is transforming us and who is writing in us
The environmental arrangement by God's hand has brought this person completely into the deepest part to live in the spirit
He is burdened excessively, beyond his power, so that he no longer has any confidence in himself or trusts in his wisdom
Chapter eleven gives us a picture, showing that what such a person experiences seemingly is not blessing but afflictions
When Paul said, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all,' he then pointed out the source, which is the love of God
If you want to enjoy this, there is no other way except to return to the spirit, to come back into the Holy of Holies
We may say that Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians occupy an important central position in the New Testament
For Christ to be formed in us means that Christ is able to spread in us and to constitute Himself into every part of our entire being
Gradually, however, He now occupies every part within us by saturating and constituting every part of our being with Himself
The book of Galatians shows us that Christ's living in us and being formed in us altogether depend on the Spirit
Finally, chapter six shows us that, before God, our being circumcised or not being circumcised does not matter
To be the new creation is to live in Christ by the spirit, to experience Christ by the spirit, and to live by Christ
He should not be blamed for this because at that time what God committed to him was the matter of justification by faith
Dear brothers and sisters, Galatians 3 speaks of the blessing promised by God to Abraham, and that blessing is the Spirit!
The blessing promised by God to Abraham is that Abraham and his descendants would be able to enjoy God Himself through Christ and in Christ
We definitely have to see that Christ is the Spirit, God Himself is Spirit, and the Holy Spirit, of course, is the Spirit
Galatians is concerning Christ as our life, whereas Ephesians is concerning the expression of Christ, which is the church
In Galatians we see that Christ is our life, while in Ephesians we see that the church is the expression of Christ
In the book of Ephesians various kinds of expressions are used to describe how the church is the expression of Christ
If today none of us had a body, and only our souls were here, there would be no way for us to express ourselves
The church can be Christ's Body, fullness, building, and bride because the church is altogether produced in the Spirit
We may all remember that Ephesians says at the beginning that all the blessings God has given us are spiritual
Chapter three says that it is altogether by being in spirit that we are able to see the vision, the mystery, and the revelation
By going over Ephesians in this way you will realize that we have not paid much attention to the spirit in our regular preaching of the word
According to Ephesians, in order for the church to be the manifestation, the expression, of Christ, she must live in the spirit
It does not use the terms 'the Spirit of God' or 'the Holy Spirit'; rather, it says, 'The Spirit of Jesus Christ'
The Spirit of such a One includes all these elements of His; hence, in this Spirit there is a bountiful supply
In chapter four Paul says, 'I have learned' , 'I have learned the secret' , and 'I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me'
The book of Colossians shows us that the enemy, by his craftiness, is doing the work of carrying us off as spoil
Sometimes he even carries people off as spoil through the messages we give, because he entices us to speak other things
Sin is not mentioned there because sin seizes only the weak Christians, the fallen Christians, and the sinning Christians
Unknowingly you may be used by Satan to take people captive so that they would not pay attention in their spirit to Christ
Today if you go and visit the United States, you will discover the extent to which Satan has taken people captive
Christ lived out is the church, and the church is the expression of Christ; these matters also are altogether in the spirit
That we are able to personally experience Christ, enjoy Christ, and gain Christ is also completely in the spirit
These four books show us that we must be in the spirit to touch this pneumatic Christ and live by Him, thereby living out the one Body
Because these two books are especially concerned about the Lord's coming again, they mention the matter of the Spirit only a few times
In these two books there is a statement that cannot be found in the New Testament nor in any other place in the entire holy Scriptures
After the other books have spoken about the Spirit, now here is a charge, a reminder: 'Do not quench the Spirit'
If we all absolutely focus on life and live deeply in the spirit, then the problems, disputes, and deformation will be gone
The reason that the churches are deformed is that they have departed from life and are not living in the spirit
The central matters of the Epistles written by Paul under the decline of the church are altogether related to life
The apostles preached that Christ, who is our Savior, comes into our spirit to be our life, thus issuing in the church as a great mystery
Another group of people were also teaching the Scriptures, but they had a different interpretation and were disputing with others
The speaking must unveil the mystery of the economy of God instead of stirring up problems among the brothers and sisters
Of course, the answer is no; it is obvious that Paul meant that those people were not to speak in the meetings
Corinthians was written in the early stage of his ministry when he felt that in the meetings the brothers and sisters all can speak
In his early years of service he had the feeling that it was best for the believers not to marry but to be wholly for the Lord
We should stress more his teaching in his final stage, because the teaching in the final stage was a mature teaching
If the speakings of the brothers unveil the mystery of God, then praise and thank the Lord; of course, they all may speak
While they hesitate, however, some of those who are very bold will take the opportunity to stand up and give a long talk
In order to experience life and to live in the spirit, we must take care of the conscience, because it is the main part of the spirit
Today the Lord is life to us in our spirit, so when we take care of our conscience, we take care of our spirit and live mostly in life
No one can know life and yet neglect the conscience, nor can anyone live in spirit and yet do things in violation of the conscience
Following this, 6:12 tells us that we need to lay hold on the eternal life, which is the Lord Himself, God Himself
In 2 Timothy 1:6-7 Paul said, 'I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands
The precious blood can only cleanse us of our sins, our filthinesses; it cannot purge away the things in our nature, in our old creation
We must know the Lord as the Spirit, and we also must know the spirit of power, of love, and of sobermindedness in us
If we depend only on studying the Bible to research truths and doctrines, then more confusion will be brought in to the church in decline
The more we research the biblical doctrines and the more we study the interpretations in letters, the more the church will suffer loss
We must bring people back from all the letters, from mere Bible researching, Bible reading, and Bible studying
