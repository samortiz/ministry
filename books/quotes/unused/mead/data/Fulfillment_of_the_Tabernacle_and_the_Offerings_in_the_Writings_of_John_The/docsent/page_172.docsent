   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GLORIFICATION OF THE FATHER IN FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>With the vine we also have the glorification of the Father through the expression of the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Fruit-bearing is not the result of a deliberate practice; instead, fruit-bearing is organically natural.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospel of John is unique in that it is concerned with divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By "divine things" we primarily mean God with His life, nature, and expression, which is His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whereas the first three Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke charge us to preach the gospel, we do not have such a charge in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this Gospel preaching is replaced by fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 15:8 the Lord Jesus says, "In this is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fruit-bearing the Father's life is expressed; hence, in fruit-bearing He is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Among today's Christians, preaching the gospel in order to win souls is emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is true that we may win souls through the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, we may not bear much fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Preaching the gospel may be merely an activity, a practice, or a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Life, on the contrary, is a matter of living, not a matter of activity or of a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Gospel of John the preaching of the gospel is not an activity; it is a living.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This living may be illustrated by a tree bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a tree brings forth fruit, the tree does not engage in any deliberate activity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Fruit-bearing is simply the issue of the tree's living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need to give a command to a peach tree to produce peaches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It would be foolish to say, "Peach tree, you must be faithful and diligent to produce peaches."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A peach tree produces fruit simply because it is a living organism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only artificial fruit can be produced as a result of making requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If you need a thousand artificial peaches, you may require workers to produce them in a day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it is unnecessary to require a living peach tree to bear fruit, and it would be useless to tell it to produce fruit overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord does not want us to produce artificial fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's desire is that we bear fruit in the way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning this, the Lord needs a genuine recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord does not want a gospel-preaching movement.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He wants genuine fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I would not say that there is nothing of life in today's gospel campaigns or movements.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, the amount of life is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Of course, the Lord is merciful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever His word is preached and whenever people call on His name, He will extend His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, many are saved in gospel campaigns.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, this does not necessarily indicate that such a campaign or movement is truly according to the Lord's way of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What the Lord wants is that we have a living that results in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 15:1 the Lord says that He is the true vine and that the Father is the Husbandman.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As the Husbandman, the Father cares for the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He waters the vine, cultivates the soil, and protects the vine from everything that would damage it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As John 15 indicates, the vine is not for a movement; the vine is for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fruit-bearing of the vine is the glorification of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The propagation or multiplication of the divine life through the vine is the glorification of the Father, that is, His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord says that if we bear much fruit, the Father will be glorified 15:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, our fruit-bearing is the glorification of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our fruit-bearing is the expression of the Triune God from within.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today the Triune God is within us as our life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The expression of the life and nature of the Triune God from within us is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, when the divine life with its nature is expressed through us in fruit-bearing, the Father is glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may also use electricity as an illustration of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the switch in a room is off, electricity is still present, but there is no expression of electricity in the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We may say that light equals glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the switch is turned on, electricity is expressed, and this expression is light, which is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, the shining of light is the glorification of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The principle is the same with the glorification of the Father in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have the divine life within us, and now this life needs to be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the divine life is expressed in fruit-bearing, that expression is the glorification of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we shall see in forthcoming messages, in John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed concerning the glory which the Father had given Him and which He had given to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The glory given by the Father to the Son and by the Son to the disciples is the divine life with the divine nature for God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Father has given His life and nature to the Son so that the Son may express the Father's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is the glory given by the Father to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Son has given us this divine life with its divine nature so that we also may express God in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In this message we are emphasizing the fact that in John 15 this expression of the divine life, this glorification of the Father, is in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Fruit-bearing is a matter of our daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Day by day we need to live a life that bears fruit, and in this way we glorify the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to John 15, what does it mean to glorify the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To glorify the Father is to express the riches of the divine life in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Concerning this matter, we need to see that every life is after its own kind.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>An apple tree will produce apples and a peach tree will produce peaches because both an apple tree and a peach tree are after their own kind.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no need to instruct an apple tree not to bear peaches or to warn a peach tree not to bear apples.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A peach tree simply bears peaches, and an apple tree simply bears apples.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This fruit-bearing comes from the life within the trees.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The principle is the same with the fruit-bearing in John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord's way in fruit-bearing is the way of the propagation of life, the multiplication of life.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As the divine life is multiplied, propagated, this life is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, the fruit-bearing of the vine is the expression, the glorification, of the divine life in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If we see the vision concerning the spreading of the vine and the fruit-bearing of the vine, we shall realize that there is no need for us to strive in ourselves to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no need for our own activity.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Instead of natural or religious activity, we simply need to live the divine life, and we shall bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As we live this life, those around us will realize that we are persons living the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As a result, they will be attracted, convinced, and subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This life will shine upon them, and eventually the Lord Jesus will be imparted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way they will become fruit produced by our living.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The proper way, the way ordained by God, for new believers to be produced is through the imparting of life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Fruit-bearing, therefore, is a matter of imparting divine life to others so that they may be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The more we express the divine life in fruit-bearing, the more the Father will be glorified.</S>
