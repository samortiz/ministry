We shall begin by considering the various aspects of the person of the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>A. THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2><p>The divine title &#8220;the Holy Spirit&#8221; is a new revelation in the New Testament. This title is not used in the Old Testament. (In Psa. 51:11 and Isa. 63:10-11 &#8220;the Holy Spirit&#8221; should be translated &#8220;the Spirit of holiness.&#8221;) This divine title is first used when God came in to prepare a forerunner of the Lord Jesus (Luke 1:15) and a human body for Christ (Luke 1:35). This indicates that the Holy Spirit is related to the incarnation of God.<p>Spirit denotes the nature of God, the nature of God&#8217;s person, and holy denotes an attribute of God&#8217;s nature. God&#8217;s nature is holy. Incarnation is a matter of bringing God&#8217;s nature into man. God desires to make His chosen people holy in the divine nature so that they may be holy even as He is holy.<p>To be holy is distinct from being common. The Holy Spirit in God&#8217;s incarnation makes man distinct from being common as God is distinct in His holy nature. Hence, what was born through God&#8217;s incarnation was a &#8220;holy thing&#8221; (Luke 1:35), and this holy thing is Jesus our Savior, who is intrinsically distinct from anything common, as God in His holy nature is distinct. The Holy Spirit, of whom the holy Jesus (Acts 3:14) was conceived and born as mentioned in Matthew 1:18 and 20, will make the believers of the holy Jesus intrinsically holy as He is holy in the divine nature. Eventually, all these believers will consummate in the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2).<p>Luke 1:15 says that John the Baptist would be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother&#8217;s womb. The Holy Spirit is the first divine title ascribed to the Spirit of God in the New Testament. It was at the time for the initiation of the gospel of God, to prepare the way for the Savior&#8217;s coming and to prepare a human body for Him, that this divine title of God&#8217;s Spirit was used. The preparing of the way for the Savior&#8217;s coming required that His forerunner be filled with the Holy Spirit so that he could separate the people unto God from all things other than God, making them holy unto Him for His purpose. The preparing of the human body for the Savior required that the Holy Spirit impart the divine nature into humanity, making man holy for the carrying out of God&#8217;s plan of redemption. Therefore, the Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence (Luke 1:35) in a human virgin, who &#8220;was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Matt. 1:18). That which was begotten in her was of the Holy Spirit (v. 20). Although Christ was born of Mary (Matt. 1:16), He was a child of the Holy Spirit. The birth of Christ was directly of the Holy Spirit. His source was the Holy Spirit, and His element was divine.<p>Many verses in the New Testament speak of the Holy Spirit. Luke 3:22 tells us that the Holy Spirit descended upon Christ in bodily form as a dove, anointing Him for His ministry. In Matthew 12:32 we have a word concerning speaking against the Holy Spirit, a word that indicates that if a sinner blasphemes the Holy Spirit, the Spirit will have no ground to work upon him to cause him to repent and believe in the Lord Jesus. According to John 20:22, the Lord Jesus on the day of His resurrection breathed into the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit. This is the receiving of the Holy Spirit as life essentially. Later, in Matthew 28:19, the Lord charges the disciples to baptize people &#8220;into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; In Acts 1:2 we see that the resurrected Christ gave command to the apostles through the Holy Spirit. Then in Romans 15:16 Paul says that in his ministry the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit. Because Christ had been wrought into them, becoming their element, the nations became an offering saturated with Christ and permeated with His divine essence.<h2 class=head1>B. THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2><p>The title &#8220;the Spirit of God&#8221; is quite common. It is used in Genesis 1:2, which says that the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. In nature God is Spirit (John 4:24), and in the Triune Godhead the last is the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). The Spirit of God is God Himself for our experience and enjoyment. God the Father is the source, God the Son is the course, the expression, and God the Spirit is the reaching and the application (2 Cor. 13:14). Therefore, the Spirit of God is God reaching us and applied to us as our portion. Regarding the Spirit of God there are two crucial points: first, that the Spirit of God is actually God Himself; second, that the Spirit of God is God reaching us and being applied to us.<p>Matthew 3:16 and 12:28 mention the Spirit of God. After the Lord Jesus was baptized, the Spirit of God descended as a dove upon Him. Although He already had the Spirit of God within Him, He still needed to have the Spirit of God upon Him for His ministry. In Matthew 12:28 the Lord says, &#8220;If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.&#8221; The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God. Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground. Wherever the Spirit of God exercises His authority over the opposing situation, that is the kingdom of God.<p>In Romans 8:9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us, and in verse 14, of the sons of God being led by the Spirit of God. We should not understand the title the Spirit of God to mean that the Spirit is something from God. In the New Testament phrases such as the love of God and the life of God mean that love and life are God Himself. In the same principle, the term the Spirit of God means that the Spirit is God. Hence, for us to be indwelt and led by the Spirit of God means that we are indwelt and led by God Himself.<h2 class=head1>C. THE SPIRIT OF THE FATHER</h2><p>The Spirit of the Father (Matt. 10:20) is the flow of the Father that flows with the Father as the source into the Father&#8217;s children for their intimate enjoyment of Him. Hence, the Spirit of the Father is the fellowship between the Father and His children.<p>Referring to times of persecution, the Lord Jesus says in Matthew 10:20, &#8220;You are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.&#8221; Here we see that the Father&#8217;s Spirit deals with the opposers&#8217; persecution. Therefore, we should learn to face persecution not in ourselves but to turn to our spirit, believing that the Father&#8217;s Spirit is with us and that He will deal with the opposers and the persecutors. We should trust in Him, let Him lead us and allow Him to do the speaking.<h2 class=head1>D. THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD</h2><p>The Spirit of the Lord (Luke 4:18; Acts 5:9; 8:39; 2 Cor. 3:17) refers to the Spirit of Jehovah (Judg. 14:6). The name Jesus in the New Testament is equal to Jehovah in the Old Testament. Hence, the Spirit of Jehovah is the Spirit of the Lord in the New Testament sense. For this reason, 2 Corinthians 3:17 speaks of the Spirit of the Lord. Actually, the Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Himself.<p>As revealed in the New Testament, the Spirit is the reality of God the Father and the Lord. This means that without the Spirit God is not real to us. Likewise, without the Spirit of the Father we do not have the reality of the Father, and without the Spirit of the Lord we do not have the reality of the Lord. Only when we have the Spirit do we have the reality of God the Father and the Lord.<h2 class=head1>E. THE SPIRIT OF THE SON OF GOD</h2><p>Galatians 4:6 says, &#8220;Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&#8221; God&#8217;s Son is the embodiment of the divine life (1 John 5:12). Hence, the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son is the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). God gives us His Spirit of life because we are His sons. As sons of God we have the position with the full right to participate in the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son, who has the bountiful supply of life.<p>The Triune God is producing many sons for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose. God the Father sent forth God the Son to redeem us from the law that we might receive sonship (Gal. 4:4-5). He also sends forth God the Spirit to impart His life into us that we may become His sons in reality. In order for us to enjoy God&#8217;s sonship, we need the Spirit. Apart from the Spirit, we cannot be born of God to have the divine life. Once we have been born of the Spirit, we need the Spirit in order to grow in life. Without the Spirit we cannot have the position, right, or privilege of sonship. All the crucial points regarding sonship depend on the Spirit. Without the Spirit sonship is vain, an empty term. But when the Spirit comes, the sonship is made real. The Spirit of the Son of God, therefore, is the reality of sonship. The Spirit of the Son makes the divine sonship real to us in our daily living.<p>We should not think that the Spirit of the Son is separate from the Son. Actually, the Spirit of the Son is another form of the Son. The One who was crucified was Christ, but the One who enters into the believers is the Spirit. First He came as the Son under the law to qualify us for sonship and to open the way for us to share in the sonship. But after He finished this work He became in resurrection the life-giving Spirit and comes to us as the Spirit of the Son. The Spirit of the Son of God vitalizes the sonship and makes it real in our experience. Today our sonship depends on the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son.<h2 class=head1>F. THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</h2><p>In Romans 8:9 Paul speaks of the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ is related to the Lord&#8217;s death and resurrection. The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of the One who passed through death and entered into resurrection. The Lord&#8217;s death was an all-inclusive termination, and His resurrection was an all-inclusive germination. The Spirit of Christ, therefore, is the totality, the aggregate, of the all-inclusive Christ with His all-inclusive death and resurrection. Because we have this Spirit in us, we have the all-inclusive Christ and His all-inclusive termination and germination.<p>The Spirit of Christ is the reality of Christ, Christ Himself in reality. Because the Spirit is the reality of Christ, we may say that this Spirit is the pneumatic Christ. By the Spirit of Christ we partake of Christ in His resurrection life and power, His transcendency, and His reigning authority.<p>First Peter 1:11 tells us that the Old Testament prophets were &#8220;searching into what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them made clear, witnessing beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these.&#8221; In the New Testament revelation the Spirit of Christ denotes the Spirit after Christ&#8217;s resurrection (Rom. 8:9-11). Before Christ&#8217;s resurrection, the Spirit that is not only the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Christ was &#8220;not yet&#8221; (John 7:39). The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God constituted through and of the death and resurrection of Christ for the application and impartation of Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection to the believers. Although the constitution of the Spirit of Christ is dispensational, constituted dispensationally through and of Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection in New Testament times, His function is eternal because He is the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14). This can be compared to the cross of Christ: its event was accomplished at the time of Christ&#8217;s death, yet its function is eternal. Hence, in the eternal sight of God, Christ was slain from the foundation of the world (Rev. 13:8). In Old Testament times, to the prophets who were seeking out and searching out the sufferings and glories of Christ, the Spirit of God, as the Spirit of Christ, made the time and the manner of time concerning Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection clear.<h2 class=head1>G. THE SPIRIT OF JESUS</h2><p>Acts 16:7 says, &#8220;When they had come down to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.&#8221; The interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit in Acts 16:6 reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament. The Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death as well. Such an all-inclusive Spirit was needed by Paul in his preaching ministry, a ministry of suffering among human beings and for human beings in the human life.<p>Just as the Spirit of Christ is the reality of Christ, so the Spirit of Jesus is the reality of Jesus. If we do not have the Spirit of Jesus, Jesus will not be real to us. But today Jesus is real to us because we have the Spirit of Jesus as the reality, the realization, of Jesus.<h2 class=head1>H. THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</h2><p>In Philippians 1:19 Paul says, &#8220;I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&#8221; The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit mentioned in John 7:39. This is not merely the Spirit of God before the Lord&#8217;s incarnation but the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit with divinity, after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, compounded with the Lord&#8217;s incarnation (humanity), human living under the cross, crucifixion, and resurrection. The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25, a compound of olive oil with four kinds of spices, was a full type of this compound Spirit of God, who is now the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Here the Spirit is not the Spirit of Jesus as in Acts 16:7, nor the Spirit of Christ as in Romans 8:9, but the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus is mainly for the Lord&#8217;s humanity and human living; the Spirit of Christ is mainly for the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. To experience the Lord&#8217;s humanity we need the Spirit of Jesus. To experience the power of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection we need the Spirit of Christ. In his suffering Paul experienced both the Lord&#8217;s suffering in His humanity and the Lord&#8217;s resurrection. Hence, to Paul the Spirit was the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the Triune God. Such a Spirit has and even is the bountiful supply for a person like Paul who was experiencing and enjoying Christ in His human living and resurrection. Eventually, this compound Spirit of Jesus Christ becomes the seven Spirits of God, who are the seven lamps of fire before His throne to carry out His administration on earth for the accomplishment of His economy with the church, and who are the seven eyes of the Lamb for the transfusing of all that He is into the church (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6).<p>Because the Spirit of Jesus has particular reference to the Lord&#8217;s suffering, and the Spirit of Christ, to His resurrection, the Spirit of Jesus Christ is related to both suffering and resurrection. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the Jesus who lived a life of suffering on earth and of the Christ who is now in resurrection. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the reality of the One who lived on earth in humanity and of the One who resurrected from among the dead and who is now both in the heavens and dwelling in the believers and who will be the center of God&#8217;s economy for eternity. The reality of such a Jesus and such a Christ is the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head1>I. THE LORD SPIRIT</h2><p>In the New Testament the Spirit is also called the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). The title &#8220;the Lord Spirit&#8221; may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ. This expression proves strongly that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and the Spirit is the Lord Christ.<p>After His resurrection and in His resurrection the Lord became the pneumatic Christ. The pneumatic Christ is identical to the Spirit. This is why 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit.&#8221; Today in resurrection the very Christ, our Lord, is identical to the Spirit who gives life. The Lord, the pneumatic Christ, is the Spirit, and the all-inclusive, life-giving, compound, processed, and consummated Spirit is actually the Lord Himself. Hence, there is no way to divide the Lord from the Spirit or to separate the Lord from the Spirit, for the Lord and the Spirit are one. Therefore, the Spirit is even called the Lord Spirit.<h2 class=head1>J. THE SPIRIT OF THE LIVING GOD</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:3 says, &#8220;Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.&#8221; The Spirit of the living God is the reality of the living God. How do we know that God is living? We know that God is living because we have the Spirit as the reality of the living God. Since we have the Spirit of the living God, we have the living God in His reality.<p>When Paul says that the apostles inscribed a letter with the Spirit of the living God, this does not mean that the Spirit of the living God is only the Spirit and not God Himself. No, the Spirit of the living God is God. The living God here is the Triune God, the One who has passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and has now been consummated in the life-giving, life-imparting, and life-dispensing Spirit. With this Spirit the apostles inscribed upon the saints to make them a letter of Christ written by them.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS PERSON</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the person of the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>K. THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2><p>In the New Testament the Spirit is also called the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The Spirit of God has been processed through Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection to consummate in the life-giving Spirit. Apart from such a process, there would not be a way for the Spirit of God to become the life-giving Spirit. Today the Spirit, who is the reality of God, the Father, the Lord, the Son of God, Christ, and Jesus, is the life-giving Spirit for imparting life into the believers. When we believed in Christ, He came into us as the life-giving Spirit, and we became one spirit with Him (1 Cor. 6:17).<p>The title &#8220;the life-giving Spirit&#8221; indicates that the Spirit is moving, working, and living in us to impart life into us. The life-giving Spirit is now working and moving in the being of the believers. The Spirit is the life-imparting Spirit, working to give life to our whole being.<h2 class=head1>L. THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2><p>The term &#8220;the Spirit of life&#8221; is used only once in the New Testament-in Romans 8:2. The Spirit is not only the life-giving Spirit but also the Spirit of life. The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life. Actually, the Spirit Himself is life. Therefore, with the Spirit of life we have the riches of the divine life.<p>The way to have life is the Spirit. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. These two are actually one. We cannot separate life from the Spirit, nor the Spirit from life. The Lord Jesus Himself said, &#8220;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&#8221; (John 6:63). Here the Lord connects the Spirit and life. If we have the Spirit, we have life. If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have life. Thus, the way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is the Spirit of life.<p>The New Testament reveals that Christ is life (John 11:25), even our life (Col. 3:4). However, Christ can be life to us only in the reality of the Spirit. Hence, it is actually the Spirit of life who is life to God&#8217;s chosen people. The Triune God as the Spirit of life makes sinners into sons of God who become the living members of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>M. THE SPIRIT OF GRACE</h2><p>The Spirit is also the Spirit of grace (Heb. 10:29). This aspect of the Spirit is related to the enjoyment of the Triune God, for the Triune God is Himself our grace. For the Spirit to be the Spirit of grace means that the Triune God in the Son as the Spirit becomes our enjoyment. The Spirit is the reaching of the Triune God to us. The Son could not come into us until He had become the Spirit. He was among the disciples, but He needed to go through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (John 14:16-20). Then He was able to breathe Himself as the Spirit into the disciples for their enjoyment (John 20:22).<p>As the Spirit of grace, the Spirit is the reality of grace. In the New Testament expressions such as the Spirit of life and the Spirit of grace indicate that the Spirit is life and grace. To partake of the Spirit of grace is to partake of the Spirit as grace. If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have grace. The reality of the divine grace we receive is the Spirit of grace.<p>The title &#8220;the Spirit of grace&#8221; also indicates that the Spirit is gracious. The Spirit we have received is a gracious Spirit, not a legal Spirit. The fact that the Spirit is gracious is indicated by Zechariah 12:10, which speaks of the outpouring of the Spirit of grace and supplication.<h2 class=head1>N. THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</h2><p>The writings of John reveal that the Spirit is the Spirit of reality (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 4:6). The Spirit is called the Spirit of reality because whatever the Father in the Son is and whatever the Son is, is realized in the Spirit. The Spirit is the realization of what God the Father and God the Son are. God the Father is light, and God the Son is life. The reality of this light and life is the Spirit. If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have the light of God the Father. If we do not have the Spirit, we cannot have God the Son as our life. The reality of all the divine attributes of both God the Father and God the Son is the Spirit. In John 14:17; 15:26; and 16:13 the Lord Jesus speaks of the Spirit of reality. First John 4:6 also uses this title of the Spirit. Furthermore, 1 John 5:6 says that the Spirit is the truth, the reality. As the Spirit of reality, the Spirit is the reality of God and of the Son. The Spirit is the reality of every divine thing, and, as such, He is the reality of eternal life. Eventually, because the Spirit is the reality, He is God, the Son, and eternal life. Apart from the Spirit of reality, eternal life would be empty, vain. Therefore, the Spirit is the reality of God, the Son, eternal life, grace, and every divine matter. Because the Spirit is the reality of all divine and spiritual entities and items, He is called the Spirit of reality.<h2 class=head1>O. THE COMFORTER (PARACLETE)</h2><p>John 14:16 reveals that the Spirit is the Comforter (the Paraclete): &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;Comforter&#8221; here is parakletos. Paraclete is the anglicized form of this Greek word. In Greek parakletos denotes someone alongside who takes care of our cause, our affairs. It is composed of two words: a preposition that means with and a form of the word for call. In ancient times a paraclete was a helper, an advocate, a counsel, an intercessor. A paraclete was someone who served a particular person by taking care of his needs. As one who is always present, a paraclete may be considered a waiter, a helper, and even an attorney. In a note on John 14:16 Darby says that a paraclete was &#8220;one who carries on the cause of any one and helps him.&#8221; In his translation of 1 John 2:1, where the same Greek word is used, Darby says that we have a patron with the Father. Then in a note he explains that he uses the word patron in the sense of the Roman patron, one who maintained the interests of his clients in every way. We may say that the Spirit today is our Patron. He is with us to take care of our situation.<p>The Paraclete, the Comforter, signifies one called to another&#8217;s side to help him. Hence, the Paraclete is a helper. The Spirit as the Paraclete is always available to help us. Furthermore, the Paraclete is an Advocate and a Counsel. He is also the One who consoles us. Therefore, He is the Consoler, the Comforter. As the consummation of the Triune God, the Spirit as the Comforter, the Paraclete, is our helper, patron, counselor, and comforter who takes care of our needs in our daily living.<h2 class=head1>P. THE SPIRIT OF POWER</h2><p>The Spirit is not only the Spirit of life but also the Spirit of power. Inwardly we have the Spirit of life essentially, and outwardly we have the Spirit of power economically. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.&#8221; The promise here is the promise of Joel 2:28 and 29, fulfilled on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:4-5, 8; 2:1-4, 16-18), for the outpouring as the power from on high for the believers&#8217; ministry economically. This is different from the Spirit of life, who was breathed into the disciples by the resurrected Christ for His indwelling so that He might be life to them essentially. In Acts 1:8 the Lord told the disciples that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit had come upon them. Eventually the Spirit as &#8220;a rushing violent wind&#8221; came as power upon the disciples for their work (Acts 2:2). Whereas we breathe in the Spirit of life, we need to put on the Spirit of power as a uniform. In order to be clothed with power we need the Spirit as a uniform. This was the reason the Lord Jesus told the disciples that they would be clothed with power from on high.<p>The Spirit of life and the Spirit of power are two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience. We see both aspects in 1 Corinthians 12:13. On the one hand, we have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body; on the other hand, we have been given to drink of the one Spirit. To be immersed in water is outward, but to drink water is inward. Furthermore, drinking the Spirit inwardly is essential, and being baptized in the Spirit outwardly is economical. The inward aspect of the Spirit is for life essentially, and the outward aspect is for ministry and work economically. The outward aspect is related to the Spirit as the Spirit of power. Just as the Spirit of life is the reality of life, so the Spirit of power is the reality of power.<h2 class=head1>Q. THE SPIRIT OF GLORY AND THAT OF GOD</h2><p>First Peter 4:14 says, &#8220;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.&#8221; Literally, the Greek says &#8220;the Spirit of glory and that of God.&#8221; The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God. The Spirit of glory is the One through whom Christ was glorified in His resurrection (Rom. 1:4). This very Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution for the glorification of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory. Such a Spirit is the Spirit of God expressed through the suffering believers and the Spirit of the experienced God enjoyed by the suffering believers. The Spirit of glory certainly was upon Stephen when he was being martyred (Acts 6:15; 7:55). According to the book of 1 Peter, the Spirit of Christ is in us (1:11), and the Spirit of glory rests upon us. The Spirit of Christ is in us to reveal all that Christ is to us for our enjoyment. The Spirit of glory rests upon us to glorify God. One aspect of this wonderful Spirit is that the Spirit is in us to reveal Christ, and another aspect of the same Spirit is that He is also the Spirit of glory resting upon us to express God. The more we suffer and are persecuted for the Lord&#8217;s sake, the more glory there will be upon us. This truly is a blessing. Therefore, we should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory and that of God is resting upon us. This Spirit of glory is the indwelling Spirit, the Spirit of Christ and the Spirit of grace, becoming the glory shining upon persecuted believers.<h2 class=head1>R. THE ETERNAL SPIRIT</h2><p>Hebrews 9:14 tells us that Christ &#8220;through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God.&#8221; On the cross Christ offered Himself to God in a human body, which is a matter of time. But He did this through the eternal Spirit, who is of eternity, without any limit of time. The eternal Spirit is beyond time and space. Whatever He is, is unlimited and eternal.<p>The eternal Spirit makes the death of Christ eternally efficacious. The accomplishment of His death covers all the Old Testament saints and the New Testament believers. Although Christ died on Calvary nearly two thousand years ago and many miles away from us, that death is applicable and available to us because it was accomplished through the eternal Spirit.<p>Hebrews 9:14 does not say that the eternal Christ offered Himself to the eternal God through the Spirit. This verse says that Christ offered Himself to God through the eternal Spirit. This offering is eternal and real because it was offered through the eternal Spirit. Today when we touch the Spirit, we touch this offering. Because we are partakers of the Spirit, we are also partakers of the unique offering. Once we become partakers of the Spirit, we partake of everything related to the Spirit.<p>When He was on earth, the Lord Jesus lived and labored through the eternal Spirit. Whatever He experienced and accomplished in His living and labor has been made eternal by the eternal Spirit. This eternal Spirit is all-inclusive, being the consummation of the processed Triune God. Now as believers we partake of this Spirit and have this Spirit within us.<h2 class=head1>S. THE SEVEN SPIRITS</h2><p>In the book of Revelation the Spirit is called the seven Spirits (1:4; 4:5; 5:6), the sevenfold intensified Spirit to counteract the degradation of the church. The seven Spirits in Revelation 1:4 undoubtedly are the Spirit of God because They are ranked among the Triune God. As seven is the number for completion in God&#8217;s operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God&#8217;s move on earth. In substance and existence God&#8217;s Spirit is one. In the intensified function and work of God&#8217;s operation His Spirit is sevenfold. It is like the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2. In existence it is one lampstand, but in function it is seven lamps. At the time the book of Revelation was written, the church had become degraded, and the age was dark. Therefore, the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God was needed for God&#8217;s move on earth.<p>In Matthew 28:19 the sequence of the Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. But in Revelation 1:4 and 5 the sequence is changed. The seven Spirits of God are listed in the second place instead of the third. This reveals the importance of the intensified function of the sevenfold Spirit of God. This point is confirmed by the repeated emphasis on the Spirit&#8217;s speaking in 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13; and 22:17.<p>The title &#8220;the seven Spirits&#8221; indicates that the Spirit has been intensified sevenfold. This Spirit intensifies all the elements of the Spirit: divinity, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, reality, life, and grace.<p>Revelation 4:5 says, &#8220;Out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.&#8221; The seven lamps here refer to the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exodus 25:37 and the seven lamps of the lampstand in Zechariah 4:2. The seven lamps of fire which are the seven Spirits of God signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God. In Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4 the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God&#8217;s move, are for God&#8217;s building, either for the tabernacle or the rebuilding of the temple. Here the seven lamps are for God&#8217;s judgment, which will issue also in God&#8217;s building-the building of the New Jerusalem.<p>Revelation 5:6 says, &#8220;I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.&#8221; Eyes are for observing and searching. Christ as the redeeming Lamb has seven observing and searching eyes for executing God&#8217;s judgment upon the universe to fulfill God&#8217;s eternal purpose, which will consummate in the building up of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in Zechariah 3:9 He is prophesied as the stone, which is the topstone (Zech. 4:7), with seven eyes for God&#8217;s building. These seven eyes are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth, running &#8220;to and fro through the whole earth&#8221; (Zech. 4:10).<p>The seven Spirits as the seven eyes of the Lamb are also for transfusing. When Christ looks at us with His seven eyes, these eyes, which are the seven Spirits, will transfuse Christ&#8217;s element into us. Whereas the seven Spirits as the seven lamps of burning fire are for enlightening and burning, the seven Spirits as the seven eyes of the Lamb are for observing, searching, and transfusing. As the Lord enlightens and judges us, He looks at us, and through the seven Spirits as His eyes He transfuses Himself into us for our transformation.<h2 class=head1>T. THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Ultimately, the Spirit of God is the Spirit. The Spirit is the totality, the aggregate, of all the elements of the titles of the Spirit of God. Hence, the Spirit is the all-inclusive Spirit.<p>When all the aspects and elements of the Spirit are put together, we have a totality, an aggregate, known in the New Testament as the Spirit (Mark 1:10; Matt. 4:1; 12:31; John 3:5, 34; 7:39; Acts 6:3; 8:18; Rom. 8:16, 23, 26, 27; Gal. 3:2, 14; 5:16-18, 22, 25; 1 Pet. 1:2; Rev. 2:7; 14:13; 22:17). As Bible is the book, so the Spirit of God today is the Spirit. The Spirit is the all-inclusive, processed, compound Spirit. This Spirit is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Father, the Spirit of the Lord, the Spirit of the Son of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the Lord Spirit, the Spirit of the living God, the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, the Spirit of grace, the Spirit of reality, the Comforter, the Spirit of power, the Spirit of glory and that of God, the eternal Spirit, and the seven Spirits.<p>John 7:39 says, &#8220;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&#8221; This verse speaks of the Spirit, telling us that before the Lord Jesus was crucified and resurrected the Spirit was not yet. The Spirit of God was there from the beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but the Spirit as the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ was &#8220;not yet&#8221; at the time of John 7:39, because the Lord Jesus had not yet been glorified. After His resurrection, that is, after He had been glorified, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ. Even though, before Christ&#8217;s death and resurrection, the Spirit of God was the Spirit of Jehovah and the Holy Spirit, the Spirit was not yet. This term-the Spirit-is often used by Paul in his Epistles and by John in the book of Revelation. In speaking of the Spirit John and Paul are referring to the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of the Triune God. Therefore, eventually and ultimately the Spirit of God is the Spirit.<p>With regard to the preaching of the gospel beforehand to Abraham, Galatians 3:14 says, &#8220;In order that the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&#8221; God in preaching the gospel to Abraham promised him the Spirit. Once again in Galatians 3:14 we do not have the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, or the Holy Spirit. In this verse we have the Spirit because the Spirit was the unique blessing of the New Testament economy promised by God to Abraham.<p>We have pointed out that in the Bible the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. However, this is not the Triune God apart from the process through which He has passed. The Spirit is the Triune God after He has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Having passed through this process, the Triune God is now this consummate Spirit as the blessing of the New Testament. Thus, the Spirit is the blessing of God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>In the book of Revelation only two titles of the Spirit are used: the seven Spirits and the Spirit. In 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; and 5:6 we have the seven Spirits. In chapters 2 and 3 the title &#8220;the Spirit&#8221; is used again and again. It is also found in Revelation 14:13 and, for the last time, in Revelation 22:17. This verse says, &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, Come.&#8221; This reveals that the Spirit as the totality of the processed Triune God has become one with the church, who is now fully matured to be the bride. Hence, the Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man. By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man will be one and will speak as one.<p>Now, at the conclusion of this message, we may give a full definition of the Spirit. The Spirit is the processed, compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, consummated Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God to be the eternal portion of His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified tripartite people as their life, life supply, and everything.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>The Spirit is the reality of all the divine entities and matters. The Spirit is the reality of God, the Father, the Lord, the Son of God, Jesus, Christ, the living God, grace, power, and glory. As such a reality, the Spirit is mysterious. Because the Spirit is mysterious and beyond our understanding, the New Testament uses many different symbols, figures of speech, to describe Him. In this message we shall begin to consider the symbols of the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>A. A DOVE</h2><p>Matthew 3:16 says, &#8220;He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him.&#8221; Here a dove symbolizes the Spirit who came upon the Lord Jesus economically for His ministry. A dove is gentle, and its eyes can see only one thing at a time. Hence, a dove signifies gentleness and singleness in sight and purpose. By the Spirit of God descending upon Him as a dove, the Lord Jesus ministered in gentleness and singleness, focusing solely on the will of God.<p>John 1:32 also speaks of a dove as a symbol of the Spirit: &#8220;John testified saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven, and He abode upon Him.&#8221; John the Baptist recommended Christ not only as the Lamb of God (John 1:29) but also as the Lamb with the dove. The Lamb takes sin away from man, and the dove brings God as life to man. The Lamb is for redemption, to redeem fallen man back to God, and the dove is for life-giving, for anointing, to anoint man with what God is, to bring God into man and man into God, and for joining the believers in God. Both are needed for man to participate in God. The dove is a symbol of the Holy Spirit, whose work is to bring God to man and join God to man. On the negative side, the Lamb solves the problem of man&#8217;s sin; on the positive side, the dove brings God to man. The Lamb separates man from sin, and the dove joins God to man.<p>The dove in John 1:32 signifies the Holy Spirit for life-giving, regenerating, anointing, transforming, uniting, and building. The dove is for life, not for power. A dove has no power, but it is full of life and insight, indicated by the eyes. The Bible appreciates the dove&#8217;s eyes, for the most beautiful part of a dove is its eyes. In the Song of Songs the Lord praises His seeker for her doves&#8217; eyes (1:15). The dove, therefore, is not a symbol of power but, being lovely, small, and full of life, a symbol of life.<h2 class=head1>B. THE FINE WOMAN SEEKING THE LOST TREASURE OF GOD</h2><p>Another symbol of the Spirit is the fine woman seeking the lost treasure of God. This symbol is found in the parable of the seeking woman: &#8220;What woman having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and seek carefully until she finds it?&#8221; (Luke 15:8). The lamp signifies the word of God (Psa. 119:105, 130) used by the Spirit to enlighten and expose the sinner&#8217;s position and condition so that he may repent.<p>According to Luke 15:8, the woman sweeps the house and seeks carefully until she finds the lost coin. The word &#8220;sweep&#8221; indicates the searching and cleansing of the inside of a sinner. Whereas the Son&#8217;s finding in Luke 15:4 is outside the sinner, the Spirit&#8217;s seeking here is inside, carried out by the Spirit&#8217;s working within the repenting sinner.<p>The Spirit seeks the sinner as a woman seeks carefully one lost coin until she finds it. This means that the Spirit comes to find us out. The book of Acts indicates this. In the Gospels the Son came to accomplish redemption. After the accomplishment of redemption by the Son, the Spirit comes to seek us and find us. Because of the Spirit&#8217;s finding of us, we repent and come back to God the Father.<p>As indicated by the parable of the seeking woman, the Spirit&#8217;s work is to enlighten us inwardly. As this seeking woman, the Spirit enlightens our inner being little by little in a fine, careful way. The Spirit enlightens our mind, then our emotion and will, and then our conscience and our entire heart. It is in this way that the Spirit &#8220;finds&#8221; us.<p>As the result of the Spirit&#8217;s finding us through enlightening us, we wake up and come to ourselves and realize how foolish it is to stay where we are. We do not wake ourselves up; on the contrary, we are awakened by the enlightening of the seeking Spirit. The seeking, enlightening, and finding of the Spirit take place in our heart and result in repentance.<p>The fact that the Spirit&#8217;s finding us takes place within the &#8220;house&#8221; of our being reveals that we were lost in ourselves, lost in our mind, emotion, and will. Therefore, the Spirit finds us in ourselves. Then, enlightened by the Spirit, we repent. This repentance resulting from the enlightening of the Spirit is an inward matter. No human being or angel is able to do such a subjective work in us. This work can be done only by the penetrating Spirit, for the Spirit is able to penetrate the depths of our being to enlighten us and expose us so that we may realize how foolish we are, repent, and decide to come back to the Father. This aspect of the Spirit is symbolized by a fine woman.<h2 class=head1>C. THE BREATH</h2><p>John 20:22 says, &#8220;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here the Spirit of life is likened to breath, which is for life. In John 20:22 the Spirit as the breath was breathed as life into the disciples for their life. By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the Lord Jesus imparted Himself into them as life and everything.<p>The Holy Spirit is actually nothing less than the resurrected Lord Jesus Himself, because this Spirit is His breath. The Greek word for Spirit in this verse is pneuma, a word that is used for breath, spirit, and wind. Therefore, this verse can rightly be translated, &#8220;Receive the holy breath.&#8221; On the day of His resurrection Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath.<p>In the Gospel of John we have God, life, and the Spirit. Chapters one through seventeen show us God living among men; chapters eighteen and nineteen, life passing through death; and chapters twenty and twenty-one, the Spirit, the pneuma, moving in resurrection. This moving of the Spirit in resurrection has not ceased. Concerning this, there is no end to the Gospel of John. This Gospel does not give us a record of Christ&#8217;s public ascension as we have in Mark and Luke. According to the Gospel of John, the resurrected Christ breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath, as the Spirit, and now dwells in them. Therefore, this breath, this pneuma, this Spirit, is still moving in resurrection.<p>The divine breath in John 20:22 is the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching His redeemed people. The New Testament reveals that the Triune God became incarnated, lived as a man on earth, ministered, entered into death, conquering and subduing it, and came forth from death in resurrection. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. John 1:14 says, &#8220;The Word became flesh,&#8221; and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says, &#8220;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&#8221; Therefore, the incarnated One was the Triune God to be a man as the last Adam, and this last Adam in resurrection has become the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, on the day of His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples, breathed upon them, and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; We all need to see the vision of the Triune God becoming the last Adam and the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God reaching us. This is the Spirit symbolized by the breath breathed into the disciples on the day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<h2 class=head1>D. THE WIND (PNEUMA)</h2><p>In John 3:8 the wind is a symbol of the Spirit: &#8220;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it is going; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&#8221; The Greek word for wind, pneuma, is the same word for Spirit. Whether it means the wind or the Spirit depends upon the context. The context here says that it blows, and the sound of it can be heard. This indicates that it is the wind. The wind brings air for us to breathe. The Spirit as the wind brings air for our spiritual breathing.<h2 class=head1>E. A RUSHING VIOLENT WIND</h2><p>In Acts 2:2 we have the symbol of a rushing violent wind. This verse says, &#8220;Suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.&#8221; In the Lord&#8217;s resurrection the Spirit of resurrection life is likened to breath, breathed into the disciples for their spiritual being and living essentially. In the Lord&#8217;s ascension the Spirit of ascension power, poured out upon the disciples, is symbolized by the rushing violent wind for the disciples&#8217; ministry and move economically. The essential Spirit of resurrection life is for the believers to live Christ; the economical Spirit of ascension power is for them to carry out His commission.<p>We need to see clearly the difference between the breathing in John 20 and the blowing in Acts 2. The breathing in John 20 is for the imparting of the life-giving Spirit into the disciples essentially for their spiritual being and living. But the blowing in Acts 2 is for the pouring out of the economical Spirit of power upon the believers, who have already received the essential Spirit into them. The pouring out of the Spirit of power is not for the believers&#8217; spiritual being or living; rather, the outpouring of the Spirit of power is for the believers&#8217; ministry and move. Therefore, the essential aspect of the Spirit, symbolized by the breath, is for living, and the economical aspect of the Spirit, symbolized by the rushing violent wind, is for ministry. We praise the Lord for the breathing of the Spirit in John 20 and for the blowing of the Spirit in Acts 2. The breathing is for life, and the blowing is for move. Furthermore, the breathing gives us inner strength, and the blowing gives us outer authority. Through the breathing and the blowing we are fully equipped.<h2 class=head1>F. CLOTHING</h2><p>Another symbol of the Spirit is clothing. As our clothing the Spirit not only covers us but is also a &#8220;uniform&#8221; that gives us authority. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.&#8221; In addition to receiving the Spirit of life essentially, the disciples still needed to be clothed with power from on high, that is, to be empowered by the Spirit economically. What took place in John 20:22 is a matter of life essentially, but what is described in Luke 24:49 is a matter of power for ministry economically.<p>In order to be clothed with power, we need to put on the Spirit as a uniform. This is typified by the mantle of Elijah (2 Kings 2:9, 13-15). For this reason, some Bible teachers have called the Spirit of power, symbolized by clothing, the &#8220;mantle Spirit,&#8221; the Spirit as an outer coat. In 2 Kings 2 Elisha was expecting to receive Elijah&#8217;s mantle. When Elisha received this mantle, it was an indication that he had received the spirit of Elijah. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus has a similar thought, the thought of the mantle Spirit. Therefore, He told the disciples to wait until they were clothed with power from on high.<h2 class=head1>G. THE LIVING WATER</h2><p>In John 4 and 7 the Spirit is symbolized by living water. John 4:10 and 14 speak of living water. In verse 14 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.&#8221; Then in John 7:37 and 38 He cried out, saying, &#8220;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&#8221; Verse 39 explains, &#8220;This He said concerning the Spirit.&#8221; In 4:14 the Lord Jesus said that whoever drinks of the water that He gives will have in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life. In chapter seven the Lord goes somewhat further, saying that anyone who drinks of Him will have the flow of the rivers of the water of life. The Lord did not speak just of one flow but of rivers. The unique river of living water is the Holy Spirit. Out of this unique river many rivers will flow out.<p>These rivers of living water are the many flows of the different aspects of life (cf. Rom. 15:30; 1 Thes. 1:6; 2 Thes. 2:13; Gal. 5:22-23) of the one unique river of water of life (Rev. 22:1), which is God&#8217;s Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). One river is the river of peace, and other rivers are joy, comfort, righteousness, life, holiness, love, patience, and humility. These rivers of living water flow out from the depths of our being. This is the Spirit as living water.<p>The symbols of the breath, the wind, the rushing violent wind, clothing, and the living water indicate that we need the Spirit in many different ways. We need the Spirit as the breath for our spiritual living, as the wind to bring us air, as the rushing violent wind to blow upon us, especially when we are dead and dry, as our clothing to give us authority, and as the living water for us to drink.<h2 class=head1>H. THE GIFT</h2><p>The Spirit is also called a gift (Acts 2:38; 10:45). God has given us a gift, and this gift is actually Himself in the form of the Spirit of reality. Hence, the Spirit of reality is a God-given gift freely given to us.<p>Acts 2:38 says, &#8220;Repent and be baptized, each one of you, upon the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The gift of the Holy Spirit is not any gift distributed by the Spirit, as mentioned in Romans 12:6, 1 Corinthians 12:4, and 1 Peter 4:10; rather, it is the gift which is the Holy Spirit Himself, given by God to the believers in Christ as the unique gift that produces all the gifts mentioned in Romans 12, 1 Corinthians 12, and 1 Peter 4.<p>The Holy Spirit in Acts 2:38 is the all-inclusive Spirit of the processed Triune God in His New Testament economy, both essential for life and economical for power, given to the believers at the time of their believing in Christ (Eph. 1:13; Gal. 3:2) as the all-inclusive blessing of God&#8217;s full gospel (Gal. 3:14), so that they may enjoy all the riches of the Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14).<p>Acts 10:45 also speaks of the Spirit as a gift: &#8220;On the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out.&#8221; As in 2:38, the gift of the Holy Spirit here refers to the Holy Spirit Himself, not something of the Holy Spirit given to the believers as a gift. This gift was poured out by God from the all-inclusive, resurrected, and ascended Christ. The pouring out of the Spirit after Christ&#8217;s ascension was the descending of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit to carry out His heavenly ministry on earth to build up His church (Matt. 16:18) as His Body (Eph. 1:23) for God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS SYMBOLS</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more symbols of the Spirit found in the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>I. THE FIRSTFRUIT</h2><p>Romans 8:23 speaks of the firstfruit of the Spirit. This firstfruit is not the first fruit borne by the Spirit. The firstfruit of the Spirit is simply the Spirit Himself as the firstfruit of the coming harvest of what God is to us. We enjoy Him as the foretaste of the full blessing to come. He is the foretaste of God for our enjoyment. Hence, to have the firstfruit of the Spirit is to enjoy the Spirit as the firstfruit.<p>The firstfruit of the Spirit is for our enjoyment; it is a foretaste of the coming harvest. This firstfruit is the Holy Spirit as a sampling of the full taste of God as our enjoyment of all that God is to us. God is so much to us. The full taste will come in the day of glory. Nevertheless, before the full taste comes, God has given us a foretaste today. This foretaste is the divine Spirit as the firstfruit of the harvest of the full enjoyment of all that He is to us.<p>The Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-has given Himself to us for our enjoyment. Eventually, we shall enter into the full enjoyment of the Triune God. For the present, God has given us the gift of the Spirit as the firstfruit to be the first taste of our divine inheritance, which is the Triune God. This first taste is the guarantee that we shall have the full taste.<h2 class=head1>J. THE CLOUD</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 10:1 and 2 the Spirit is symbolized by the cloud: &#8220;All our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea.&#8221; Verse 1 says that our fathers &#8220;were under the cloud.&#8221; The cloud that covered the children of Israel typifies the Spirit of God being with the New Testament believers. Immediately after the New Testament believers take Christ as their Passover (1 Cor. 5:7), the Spirit of God comes to be with them and leads them to run the Christian race, just as the pillar of cloud came to be with the children of Israel and to lead them (Exo. 13:21-22; 14:19-20).<p>First Corinthians 10:2 speaks of being baptized &#8220;in the cloud,&#8221; which signifies in the Spirit. When we were baptized, we were baptized in the Spirit. In one Spirit we were baptized into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13).<p>The cloud, which brought God&#8217;s presence to His people, also appeared when the children of Israel were gathered at Mount Sinai (Exo. 19:9, 16) and when the tabernacle was erected (Exo. 40:34-38). The cloud in Exodus 19 indicated that God the Spirit was appearing to overshadow the area where His people were gathered to receive the heavenly revelation. Then in Exodus 40 the cloud overshadowed the tabernacle, covering it. This indicates that the Triune God was appearing to His people and that He was reaching them and was being applied to them. In the church life today we also should be overshadowed and covered by the Spirit as the cloud.<p>According to the Bible, there is fire in the cloud (Exo. 40:38). This indicates that when we are overshadowed by the Spirit, we are enlightened by Him. The Spirit gives us light by which we may walk. This is the Spirit as the cloud.<h2 class=head1>K. THE SPIRITUAL DRINK</h2><p>First Corinthians 10:4 says, &#8220;All drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.&#8221; The spiritual drink here refers to the living water which flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6) and that typifies the Spirit as our all-inclusive drink (John 7:37-39; 1 Cor. 12:13). The Spirit as symbolized by the spiritual drink is the ultimate issue of the Triune God. This drink quenches our thirst and satisfies our being. In our Christian life we should all drink the same spiritual drink; we should not drink anything other than the all-inclusive Spirit.<h2 class=head1>L. THE OIL</h2><p>In Hebrews 1:9, Matthew 25:3-4, 8-9, and Luke 10:34 the Spirit of God is symbolized by the oil. The oil is simply of one single element, symbolizing that the Spirit of God was merely of the element of divinity. It is with this Spirit that God has anointed Christ.<h2 class=head1>M. THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</h2><p>Another symbol of the Spirit is the compound ointment (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27). According to the type in Exodus 30, a hin of olive oil was compounded with four spices to produce the holy anointing oil, the holy ointment. In typology oil signifies the Spirit of God, and the compound ointment, the oil blended with four spices, signifies the Holy Spirit, the compound Spirit. Through a compounding process the oil became an ointment and was used to anoint the tabernacle and everything related to it. The priests also were anointed with this holy ointment. Before Exodus 30 this compound was &#8220;not yet,&#8221; but after Exodus 30 such an ointment was definitely in existence. In like manner, before Christ was crucified, resurrected, and glorified, the Spirit as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was not yet (John 7:39). But through the process of Christ&#8217;s crucifixion and resurrection the Spirit of God, typified by the oil, became the compound Spirit, typified by the ointment.<p>The four spices used to make the ointment in Exodus 30- myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia-typify respectively the effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, the sweetness of His death, the power of His resurrection, and the fragrance of His resurrection. Before Christ&#8217;s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God did not have these four elements. But after Christ&#8217;s resurrection these elements were compounded into the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God became the Spirit, the compound Spirit symbolized by the compound ointment (see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157-163).<p>In this compound ointment we have the Triune God signified by the numbers one and three (one hin of olive oil; three complete units of five hundred shekels-Exo. 30:23-25) and humanity signified by the number four (four spices). We also have the death of Christ, the effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection, and the flavor of His resurrection. This compound ointment is a picture of today&#8217;s compound Spirit. Before the Lord&#8217;s crucifixion and resurrection, the Spirit of God was not a compound. He had merely divinity, nothing else. But after the Lord&#8217;s resurrection this Spirit of God was compounded with humanity, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, and the effectiveness of His resurrection. This all has been compounded into one ointment which today is the Spirit. Before Christ&#8217;s resurrection the Spirit of God, but not the compound Spirit, was in existence. After the Lord Jesus was crucified and resurrected, the compound Spirit came into being. On the day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection the Spirit of God became the compound Spirit. In the compound Spirit there are many items: divinity, humanity, the effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, and the power of Christ&#8217;s resurrection.<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul says, &#8220;He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&#8221; First John 2:20 says that we have an anointing from the Holy One, and verse 27 says that this anointing abides in us. &#8220;Christ&#8221; is the anglicized form of the Greek word Christos, which means the anointed One. The Greek word for anointing is chrisma. Because we have been attached by God to Christ, the anointed One, we are spontaneously anointed with Him by God. Christ has been anointed with the divine ointment, and the ointment that is upon Him now flows in us. This is pictured in Psalm 133, which says that the anointing oil flows from the head of Aaron to his beard and even to the skirts of his priestly robe. This indicates that Christ has an abundance of the anointing oil. God has poured the ointment upon Him. Through that anointing Christ has received the ointment, and eventually He, the anointed One, became the anointing One. In fact, He has even become the anointing. When He entered into us as the anointed One, He became the anointing One in us. Actually, the anointing that dwells in us is the anointed One becoming the anointing One and also the anointing.<p>God&#8217;s intention is to work Himself into us as our life and our everything to make us His counterpart for His expression. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary for God to pass through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection. When He entered into resurrection, He became the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is actually Christos, the anointed One, becoming the life-giving One. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received Him into us. The One we received is the anointed One, who through death and resurrection has become the anointing One. Furthermore, this anointing One is the all-inclusive, indwelling Spirit. As soon as we believed in Him, He as the Spirit entered our spirit. Now He is within our spirit to anoint us, &#8220;paint&#8221; us, with the element of the Triune God. The more this &#8220;painting&#8221; goes on, the more the element of the Triune God is transfused into our being. Today we all are under the anointing of the compound Spirit with Christ&#8217;s divinity, humanity, all-inclusive death, and wonderful resurrection. This is the Spirit as the compound ointment.<h2 class=head1>N. A SEAL</h2><p>Second Corinthians 1:22 says that God has sealed us, and Ephesians 1:13 and 4:30 tell us that, as believers, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit. The anointing in 2 Corinthians 1:21 is the sealing in verse 22. Because God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him. To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. We have been made God&#8217;s inheritance (Eph. 1:11). At the time we were saved God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belonged to God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&#8217;s image signified by the seal, thus making us like God.<p>We should not regard the sealing as separate from the anointing. Actually, anointing implies sealing. As we are under the anointing, the anointing becomes a sealing. In this way we become different from others. Furthermore, the seal causes us to bear the appearance of God. When God anoints, the anointing is the sealing. The anointing brings the divine essence into us. First, through the anointing God adds the essence of Himself to us. Then this anointing seals us with the essence of God, forming the divine element into an impression to express God&#8217;s image, thereby making us the image of God.<p>The seal of the Spirit signifies ownership. It signifies that God is our owner and that we belong to Him. The anointing within us as the sealing declares to the universe that we belong to God. God possesses us, and He has put Himself upon us as a seal.<p>The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God. This implies that the seal of the Holy Spirit is the expression of God and brings God&#8217;s image into our being. When we bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God upon us, we bear the image of God and the expression of God. The anointing within us becomes the seal, and the seal bears the very image of God. In this way we bear the image of God. This means that we express God by being anointed and by being sealed. Therefore, the seal of the Holy Spirit denotes both ownership and expression.<h2 class=head1>O. A PLEDGE-GUARANTEE-FORETASTE</h2><p>The New Testament also speaks of the Spirit as a pledge (2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5; Eph. 1:14). In 2 Corinthians 1:22 Paul says that God has given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts. The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge. The seal of the Spirit is a mark that we are God&#8217;s inheritance, God&#8217;s possession, belonging to God. The pledge of the Spirit is a guarantee that God is our inheritance or heritage belonging to us. The Spirit within us is the pledge, an earnest, of God being our portion in Christ.<p>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is &#8220;the pledge of our inheritance.&#8221; We need the Spirit as both the seal and the pledge because in God&#8217;s work on us two kinds of inheritances are involved. Ephesians 1:11 indicates that we were made God&#8217;s inheritance, and verse 14, that God is our inheritance. In God&#8217;s economy we are an inheritance to God, and God is an inheritance to us. This is a mutual inheritance. For us to be God&#8217;s inheritance we need the seal. We are God&#8217;s possession, and as our owner God has put a seal upon us. Because God is our inheritance we also need the pledge of the Spirit as a guarantee. We shall inherit all that God is. For such an inheritance, the Holy Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee.<p>The Greek word for pledge in Ephesians 1:14 also means foretaste, guarantee, token payment guaranteeing the full payment, a part payment in advance. Because God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge of this inheritance to us. God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our inheritance, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God.<p>In ancient times the Greek word for pledge was used in the purchase of land. The seller gave the buyer a sample of the soil from the land being purchased. Hence, a pledge, according to ancient Greek usage, was also a sample. The Holy Spirit is the sample of what we shall inherit of God in full. As those who are to inherit God, we have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, guarantee, earnest, and down payment of our inheritance. At the same time the Spirit is also a sample and a foretaste. The foretaste gives us a taste of God; the full taste is yet to come.<h2 class=head1>P. THE INK</h2><p>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 ink is a symbol of the Spirit: &#8220;Being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God.&#8221; The Spirit of the living God, who is the living God Himself, is not an instrument, like a pen for writing, but the very element, like the ink, with which the apostles minister Christ as the content for the writing of living letters that convey Christ. The writer of this letter is not the Spirit of God; the writer is the apostles. The Spirit of the living God is the &#8220;ink,&#8221; the element, the essence of the writing. This means that the Spirit of the living God is the element with which the letter is written.<p>The ministry of the apostles is to write letters with the life-giving Spirit as the essence. The more the apostles minister to you, the more they put into you the element of the life-giving Spirit.<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:3 Paul says &#8220;inscribed not with ink&#8221;; he does not say &#8220;inscribed not by ink.&#8221; The preposition &#8220;with&#8221; indicates that the spiritual ink, the Spirit of the living God, is an essence, an element, used by the one doing the inscribing or the writing. The Spirit is neither the writer nor the instrument used for writing; rather, the Spirit is the essence, the element, the substance, used in writing. The Spirit of the living God is the heavenly ink used by the apostles in writing living letters that convey Christ. Therefore, Paul&#8217;s view of the Spirit here is that of an essence used for inscribing letters of Christ.<h2 class=head1>Q. THE SEVEN LAMPS OF FIRE BURNING BEFORE THE THRONE OF GOD</h2><p>In Revelation 4:5 the Spirit is symbolized by the seven lamps of fire burning before God&#8217;s throne, which are the seven Spirits of God. The seven lamps of fire, which are the seven Spirits of God, signify the enlightening and searching of the sevenfold intensified Spirit of God. God will touch the earth by the seven lamps, by His seven Spirits, which are burning, shining, observing, searching, and judging. The seven lamps here refer to the seven lamps of the lampstand in Exodus 25:37 and in Zechariah 4:2. In Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4 the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God&#8217;s move, are for God&#8217;s building. In Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps are for God&#8217;s judgment, which will issue in the building of the New Jerusalem. While God executes His judgment, His sevenfold intensified Spirit will carry out His eternal building by searching, enlightening, and judging.<p>The seven lamps of fire burning before the throne of God are for enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning. All this is for the carrying out of God&#8217;s administration. Today, God is administrating His government by means of enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning. Anything that does not correspond to God&#8217;s nature will be burned by His fire. Although we have been saved and have undergone some amount of transformation, our work will be burned if it is wood, grass, and stubble and not gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 3:15). Any fleshly work, work done in the name of the Lord but actually having nothing to do with Him, will be burned. Everything that is not of God or according to God will be counted by God as wood, grass, and stubble, and it will be burned by fire. This burning is the carrying out of God&#8217;s administration. The Bible reveals that God is the burning One (Deut. 4:24; Heb. 12:29). All things outside of Him or that do not correspond to His nature will be burned.<p>Although the seven enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning lamps will burn all that does not correspond to God, they will refine those things that are truly according to His nature. The dross will go to the lake of fire, but the refined gold will go to the New Jerusalem. Even now the seven Spirits as the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne of God are burning, refining, and purifying for the carrying out of God&#8217;s universal governmental administration.<h2 class=head1>R. THE SEVEN EYES OF THE LAMB</h2><p>In Revelation 5:6 we have yet another symbol of the Spirit-the seven eyes of the Lamb: &#8220;I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.&#8221; The seven lamps are simultaneously the seven eyes of the Lamb. The lamps are for enlightening and burning; the eyes are both for watching and observing and also for infusing and transfusing. As the redeeming Lamb, Christ has seven watching and observing eyes for the carrying out of God&#8217;s administration. These seven eyes are also transfusing all that the Lamb is into our being so that we may become the same as He. The way for us to be transformed is to come to Him and be seen by Him. As the Lord enlightens and judges us, He looks at us, and His seven eyes transfuse Himself into us.<p>It is significant that in Revelation 5:6 the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ, the Lamb. A person&#8217;s eyes cannot be separated from the person himself, for a person&#8217;s eyes are his expression. Our inner being is expressed mainly through our eyes. In like manner, the seven Spirits are the seven eyes of Christ by which Christ expresses Himself. As a person and his eyes are one, so Christ and the Spirit are one. Therefore, it is a mistake to say that the Spirit is separate from Christ. Since the seven Spirits are the Holy Spirit and are also the eyes of Christ, then the Holy Spirit, who is the seven Spirits, is not separate from Christ. The Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the expression of the Son. The seven eyes of Christ, which are the seven Spirits of God, are Christ&#8217;s expression in God&#8217;s move for God&#8217;s building. Today Christ&#8217;s eyes are upon us so that we can be transformed and conformed to His image for God&#8217;s building.<h2 class=head1>S. THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2><p>The last symbol of the Spirit in the New Testament is the river of water of life: &#8220;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street&#8221; (Rev. 22:1). This river of water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply. It is typified by the water that came out of the riven rock (Exo. 17:6; Num. 20:11) and symbolized by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus (John 19:34). In Revelation 22:1 the water of life becomes a river proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem. Therefore, as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God, the Spirit as the river of water of life is the flow of the processed Triune God with Himself as the water of life to satisfy His chosen people that He may have an eternal manifestation to express Himself for eternity.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS ATTRIBUTES</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the attributes of the Spirit. We use the word &#8220;attributes&#8221; to denote the virtues of God&#8217;s being. God has a nature, and this nature is for His being. In God&#8217;s being there are many excellencies, and these excellencies are the virtues of the divine being. We may consider these virtues the divine attributes. Therefore, when we speak of the attributes of God, we mean the excellencies of what God is. Likewise, the attributes of the Spirit are the excellencies, the virtues, of what the Spirit is.<h2 class=head1>A. LIFE</h2><p>The first attribute of the Spirit is life (Rom. 8:2). This life, of course, is the divine, eternal, uncreated life of God. In the New Testament physical life and psychological life are indicated by the Greek words bias and psuche respectively. When Paul speaks of life in Romans 8:2, however, he uses another Greek word, the word zoe. In the Bible zoe denotes God&#8217;s life, the divine, infinite, uncreated, eternal life. This is the life we receive by believing in the Lord Jesus: &#8220;He who believes in the Son has eternal life&#8221; (John 3:36). Paul uses this Greek word for life in Romans 8 to indicate the dispensing of the divine life into our being. God desires to dispense Himself as life into us. This dispensing began when we were regenerated, for at that time we received eternal life.<p>The life which is an attribute of the Spirit is eternal. The word &#8220;eternal&#8221; denotes not only the duration of time, which is everlasting, without end, but also the quality, which is absolutely perfect and complete, without any shortage or defect. Moreover, the life which is eternal is eternal with respect to its sphere. Therefore, the word eternal denotes three things: time, space, and quality. As to the element of time, this life will last forever. As to space, to sphere, this life is vast, unlimited. As to quality, eternal life is perfect and complete, without defect or shortage. The sphere of eternal life encompasses the whole universe. Eternal life is neither temporary nor limited; rather it is everlasting with respect to time and unlimited with respect to space. Furthermore, eternal life has no defects or shortages.<p>The Spirit is the Spirit of such a life. The Spirit and life are one and cannot be separated. He is of life, and life is of Him. Life is His content, and He is the reality of life. Speaking more accurately, the Spirit is not only the reality of life but also life itself. Life is of the Spirit and issues from the Spirit. The Spirit is the source, whereas life is the current, or flow, that comes from the Spirit.<p>The Spirit is the Spirit of life because God and Christ being life hinges on Him. The Father is the source of life, the very life itself. Because the Son is the manifestation of the Father (1 Tim. 3:16), He is the manifestation of life (1 John 1:2). And because the Spirit is the entering of the Son, He is the entering in of life. Life originally is in the Father, in the Son it is manifested among man, and as the Spirit it enters into man for man to experience. Thus, the Spirit becomes the Spirit of life. Because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, we can receive life through the Spirit. Because the Spirit is the Spirit of life, when we exercise our spirit to touch the Spirit, we touch life. When we contact the Spirit, we contact life.<p>The book of Romans speaks of having life (1:17), of being saved in life (5:10), of reigning in life (5:17), of walking in newness of life (6:4), and of being sanctified in life (6:22-23). Because the Spirit is of life, the way to have life is the Spirit. The way to be saved in life is the Spirit. The way to reign in life is the Spirit. The way to walk in newness of life is the Spirit. The way to be sanctified in life is the Spirit. Life belongs to the Spirit, and the Spirit is of life. If we have the Spirit, we have life. If we do not have the Spirit, we do not have life. If we walk in the Spirit, we walk in life. If we do not walk in the Spirit, we do not walk in the newness of life. Therefore, the way to experience the divine, eternal, uncreated life is the Spirit.<p>Because the Spirit has the attribute of life, the divine life is being dispensed into us in a threefold way. First, our spirit becomes life. &#8220;If Christ is in you...the spirit is life because of righteousness&#8221; (Rom. 8:10). Christ is the Triune God who has become the indwelling Spirit. As the life-giving Spirit, Christ dwells in our spirit, and His indwelling makes our spirit life. Second, &#8220;the mind set on the spirit is life&#8221; (Rom. 8:6b). The mind is the leading part of our soul and represents the soul. Thus, when the mind becomes life, our soul becomes life. Finally, life is imparted to our mortal bodies. According to Romans 8:11, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead gives life to our mortal bodies through the indwelling Spirit. Therefore, life is imparted into us in a threefold way: our spirit becomes life, our mind becomes life, and life is imparted to our mortal bodies. All this is through the Spirit of life.<h2 class=head1>B. LOVE</h2><p>Another attribute of the Spirit is love. Romans 15:30 speaks of the love of the Spirit; Galatians 5:22 indicates that love is the fruit of the Spirit; and Colossians 1:8 mentions the believers&#8217; love in the Spirit. The love which is an attribute, or excellency, of the Spirit is the nature of God&#8217;s essence. This love is the essence of God&#8217;s being, the very substance of the divine life.<p>Love is necessary for human life. In order to live as human beings, we must have love. Without love the situation in society and in our families would be pitiful. Love is needed even the more for the Christian life and the church life. Apart from the divine love, we cannot live together as members of Christ. Therefore, the Lord Jesus charged us to love one another (John 13:34-35). If we do not love one another with the divine love, we cannot have the church life. But through the love that is an attribute of the Spirit we can love others. Through the enjoyment of this love we are able to love anyone, even those who hate us and persecute us. The divine love, the love of the Spirit, cannot be exhausted by any kind of situation.<p>It is necessary for us to differentiate our natural, human love from the love that is the fruit of the Spirit. Before we received the divine life and were saved, we had some capacity to love. But our natural virtue of love does not contain anything of God, whereas the love that is the fruit of the Spirit is filled with a spiritual substance which is divine. We should remember that genuine love is the fruit of the Spirit. The substance, the element, of this love is the Spirit. Therefore, the difference between our natural human love and the love that is the fruit of the Spirit is that our natural love does not contain anything of the Spirit, whereas the love of the Spirit is full of the substance and element of the Spirit. What we need in the church life is a love full of the substance of the Spirit.<p>Only one kind of love is genuine, and that is the love that is the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God. Because the Spirit has the attribute of love, the more we are under His dispensing, the more genuine love we have. Actually, the more the Spirit is dispensed into us, the more we become love in the sense of being constituted of the divine love. Then we shall have the love that is the expression of the Spirit, and we shall respond to others with this love.<h2 class=head1>C. JOY</h2><p>Another attribute of the Spirit is joy. Romans 14:17 says that the kingdom of God, which is the reality of the church life, is joy in the Holy Spirit. First Thessalonians 1:6 tells us that the believers &#8220;accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Furthermore, Galatians 5:22 indicates that joy is a fruit of the Holy Spirit.<p>All people need joy. As Christians, we have joy when we are filled with the love of God and the divine life. Love comes from life, and joy comes from love. The Spirit of God is the Spirit of the divine life, the divine love, and the divine joy. The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy. Therefore, we may have joy in the Holy Spirit, a joy that is of the Spirit. If we cannot praise the Lord, we are defeated and are not in the Holy Spirit. But if we are in the Spirit, we shall be joyful with God and praise Him.<h2 class=head1>D. COMFORT</h2><p>Acts 9:31 says, &#8220;The church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied.&#8221; This verse indicates that the church was suffering affliction through persecution, in which she feared the Lord and enjoyed the comfort of the Holy Spirit. Here we see that comfort is an attribute of the Spirit.<p>In our experience the comfort of the Spirit is related to the joy of the Spirit. It is when we have joy that we are comforted. Without joy there is no comfort. First we have life, and then we enjoy love. When we enjoy the divine love, we have joy and also comfort.<h2 class=head1>E. HOLINESS FOR SANCTIFICATION</h2><p>The New Testament reveals that the Holy Spirit has the attribute of holiness for sanctification (1 Pet. 1:2; Rom. 15:16). In the New Testament the word &#8220;holy&#8221; means separated to God, set apart to Him. To be holy is to be different, distinct, from everything that is common. In the universe there is only one nature that is absolutely different from all other things, and this is the nature of God. Hence, God is holy. It is not an insignificant matter to be holy, for to be holy is virtually to be divine. It is to be separate, different, from anything other than God.<p>Holiness and sanctification both refer to an element that is holy. Holiness refers to the element itself, for holiness is the nature and quality of being holy. Sanctification refers to the process of being made holy, the process of being sanctified. A process is going on to make us holy. This process is sanctification. Therefore, to have holiness is to have the element, and to undergo sanctification is to be in the process of being made holy. Furthermore, sanctification may also denote the practical effect produced, the character and activity, and the resultant state of being sanctified to God (Rom. 6:19, 22).<p>In the Greek text of the New Testament many times the expression &#8220;the Spirit, the holy&#8221; is used (1 Thes. 4:8; Heb. 3:7). I believe that the reason for this is that in the New Testament the emphasis is not only on the Spirit but also on holiness. The Spirit has the attribute of holiness and even is holiness. Therefore, the Holy Spirit is sometimes called the Spirit, the holy. Where the Spirit is, there holiness is also. The all-inclusive Spirit dwells in us with a condition, a state, of holiness. The Spirit Himself is the essence, the very substance, of holiness. When this Spirit enters into our spirit and remains there as the essence of holiness, there is in our spirit a condition of holiness.<p>First Peter 1:2 speaks of the sanctification of the Spirit. Sanctification of the Spirit here is not the sanctification of the Spirit which comes after justification through the redemption of Christ, as revealed in Romans 6:19, 22 and 15:16. In 1 Peter 1 sanctification of the Spirit, as the main emphasis of this chapter, an emphasis on holiness (vv. 15-16), is before the obedience of faith in Christ&#8217;s redemption, that is, before justification through Christ&#8217;s redemption (1 Cor. 6:11), indicating that the believers&#8217; obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying work. The Spirit&#8217;s sanctification in its two aspects is inclusively revealed in 2 Thessalonians 2:13, which is for the full salvation of God to His chosen people. God&#8217;s full salvation is carried out in the sphere of the Spirit&#8217;s sanctification.<p>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says that God has chosen us &#8220;unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit.&#8221; The salvation unto which we were chosen by God is salvation in sanctification of the Spirit. Sanctification of the Spirit is the divine transformation. By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord&#8217;s glory. Therefore, the Spirit dwells in us for sanctification. The indwelling of the Spirit is actually our sanctification. The Spirit dwells in us with one goal-to sanctify us, to transform us. This is sanctification of the Spirit.<p>In Romans 15:16 Paul says, that &#8220;the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here to be sanctified means to be separated, to be made holy with transformation in life. This is not merely objective positional sanctification but subjective dispositional sanctification. This sanctification is to renew us, transform us, and conform us to the image of God&#8217;s firstborn Son so that we may be fitting to be a living member of the Body of Christ.<p>We all need to be sanctified, to be made holy. For us to be made holy means that we are separated unto God and become one with Him. If the Spirit did not have the attribute, the excellency, of holiness, He could not sanctify us. But the Spirit does have the attribute of holiness, and this excellency is His power to sanctify us, thereby making us distinct from all that is common.<h2 class=head1>F. REALITY</h2><p>In God&#8217;s New Testament economy the Spirit has the attribute of reality (John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13). Reality is the all-inclusive attribute of the Spirit of God, for it includes the Father, Christ the Son, and all the divine items and entities. The Spirit is the reality of Christ and of the divine revelation. Hence, the Spirit is the reality (1 John 5:6). The Holy Spirit is the all-inclusive reality. Reality, therefore, is one of the most marvelous attributes of the Spirit.<p>Apart from the Spirit of reality, in our experience we cannot have the Trinity or any of the divine attributes. These would be nothing more than terms to us. The reality of the Triune God and of all His attributes is the Spirit of reality.<p>As the Spirit of reality, the Spirit is the reality of God and of the Son. The Spirit is the reality of every divine thing, and, as such, He is the reality of eternal life. Eventually, because the Spirit is the reality, He is God, the Son, and eternal life. Without the Spirit of reality, eternal life would be empty, vain. Therefore, the Spirit is the reality of God, the Son, eternal life, and every divine matter. This is the reason He is called the Spirit of reality.<p>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, reality had not yet entered into man. The reality was present, for Christ Himself is reality (John 14:6). But this reality was only among the disciples; it had not come into them. Therefore, the Lord told the disciples that it was expedient for them that He go away (John 16:7). The purpose of His going was for Him to have a change in form, a change from the form of the flesh to the form of the Spirit. As soon as this change had been accomplished, His reality would become the reality of the Spirit, and the Spirit would become the Spirit of reality. Then this Spirit of reality would come to abide in the disciples. The Lord Jesus said in John 14:17, &#8220;Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.&#8221; Because the Spirit of reality has come into us, reality now abides in us.<h2 class=head1>G. POWER</h2><p>The last attribute of the Spirit revealed in the New Testament is power. Luke 4:14 says, &#8220;Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.&#8221; The power of the Spirit here is economical, for it is power for ministry. The Spirit in verse 14 is the Holy Spirit who descended upon the Lord Jesus at the time of His baptism for the accomplishment of His ministry. Before the Holy Spirit in power descended upon Him, He already had the Holy Spirit within Him essentially for His living. Therefore, the Lord Jesus had the Holy Spirit both essentially as life for His living and economically as power for His ministry.<p>In Romans 15:13 Paul speaks of the believers abounding &#8220;in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here the power of the Holy Spirit is not economical but essential. The believers&#8217; abounding in hope is not a work; it is an aspect of their living. For this aspect of the living of the believers, the power of the Holy Spirit is needed essentially.<p>Acts 1:8 is another verse that speaks of the economical power of the Spirit: &#8220;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.&#8221; To receive power is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit (Acts 1:5) for the fulfillment of the promise of the Father (v. 4). The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of Christ&#8217;s resurrection (John 20:22) to be the Spirit of life to them essentially. The same Holy Spirit came upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be the Spirit of power economically. Both essentially and economically the Spirit has the attribute of power. According to Acts 1:8, through the power of the Spirit, which truly is an excellency of the Spirit, we may be Christ&#8217;s witnesses to the remotest part of the earth.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS COMING</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>Beginning with this message, we shall consider the Spirit&#8217;s coming. This matter is a mystery. The New Testament describes the coming of the Spirit to John the Baptist, to Mary, the mother of Jesus, to Jesus Christ, to the saints in the transitional period between Christ&#8217;s incarnation and resurrection, and to the New Testament believers.<h2 class=head1>A. TO JOHN THE BAPTIST- FILLING HIM ECONOMICALLY FOR POWER</h2><p>The coming of the Holy Spirit to John the Baptist was the first instance of the Spirit&#8217;s coming to God&#8217;s people in the New Testament. Luke 1:15 says of him, &#8220;He will be great before the Lord, and will by no means drink wine and strong drink; and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; The word here about not drinking wine or strong drink indicates that John was to be a Nazarite (Num. 6:1-4). Instead of drinking wine, he would be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit replaces the wine (Eph. 5:18).<p>The Spirit came to John the Baptist by filling him economically. The Greek word for &#8220;filled&#8221; in Luke 1:15, pletho, signifies an outward filling. This indicates that John was filled with the Spirit outwardly as power for ministry. Because John the Baptist was filled with the Holy Spirit economically for power, he could minister in a way to separate people to God and bring them back to God. The preparing of the way for Christ&#8217;s coming required that John the Baptist, His forerunner, be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother&#8217;s womb, so that he could separate the people unto God from all things other than God, making them holy unto Him for His purpose.<p>John the Baptist was the first one in the New Testament who was filled with the Holy Spirit. Because he was filled with the Holy Spirit economically for power, he could fulfill the words spoken concerning him in Luke 1:16 and 17: &#8220;Many of the sons of Israel he will turn to the Lord their God. And he will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to children, and the disobedient to the prudence of the righteous, to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.&#8221; This was the fulfillment of Malachi 4:5, a verse that prophesied that Elijah would come. It was said of John the Baptist that he would go before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah. Therefore, in a sense, John may be considered &#8220;Elijah, who is about to come&#8221; (Matt. 11:14).<h2 class=head1>B. TO MARY, THE MOTHER OF JESUS- TO OVERSHADOW HER FOR THE CONCEIVING OF JESUS</h2><p>After the Holy Spirit came to John the Baptist, the Spirit came to Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the way of overshadowing her for the conceiving of Jesus. Luke 1:35 says, &#8220;The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; wherefore also the holy thing which is born will be called, Son of God.&#8221; The Spirit came to Mary for no other purpose than to overshadow her for the conceiving of Jesus.<p>As the cloud overshadowed the Mount of Transfiguration (Matt. 17:5) and the tabernacle (Exo. 40:34, 38), the power of the Most High overshadowed Mary. It seems that, according to Luke 1:35, the Holy Spirit was only upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the Holy Child. However, as we shall see when we consider the coming of the Spirit to Jesus Christ, Mary &#8220;was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit,&#8221; for that which was begotten in her was of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:18, 20). Therefore, the Spirit came to Mary, overshadowing her, in such a way that something of the Holy Spirit was begotten in her.<h2 class=head1>C. TO JESUS CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>1. As the Divine Essence for the Conceiving and Birth of Jesus</h2><p>The third instance of the coming of the Spirit in the New Testament is the coming of the Spirit to Jesus Christ as both the divine essence and the divine power. First, the Spirit came as the divine essence for the conceiving and birth of Jesus (Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20). This was the coming of the Spirit essentially for Christ&#8217;s existence and being as the God-man. The Lord Jesus was conceived of the divine essence, and this essence constituted His being.<p>As the God-man, Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence. The Holy Spirit is God Himself reaching man. In the conceiving of the God-man, the Holy Spirit came into humanity. The God-man was conceived of the Holy Spirit not only with the divine nature but also with the divine essence. Because Jesus Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit, He has the divine essence, the essence of God.<p>Concerning the conceiving of the God-man, Luke 1:35 speaks of the Holy Spirit coming upon Mary and the power of the Most High overshadowing her. It seems that, according to this verse, the Holy Spirit only came upon Mary as the power for her to conceive the Lord Jesus. However, Matthew 1:18 and 20 tell us that Mary &#8220;was found having in womb out of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (lit.), and &#8220;the thing begotten [generated] in her is out of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (lit.). This indicates that the divine essence out of the Holy Spirit had been generated in Mary&#8217;s womb before she delivered the Lord Jesus.<p>Because the God-man was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence and was born of a human virgin with a human essence, He has two essences, the divine and the human. Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and the human essences, constitutes a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, producing the God-man, the One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced.<p>The conception of John the Baptist and that of Jesus the Savior are strikingly different in essence. The conception of John the Baptist was God&#8217;s miracle, accomplished with the overage human essence, merely by the divine power, without the divine essence being involved, thus bringing forth a mere man who was only filled with the Spirit of God economically for power but lacked the nature of God. The conception of the Savior was God&#8217;s incarnation (John 1:14), constituted not only by the divine power, but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, hence producing the God-man of two natures-divinity and humanity. Through this, God joined Himself to humanity that He might be manifested in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:16) and be our Savior (Luke 2:11).<h2 class=head2>2. As the Divine Power for the Anointing of Christ</h2><p>The Holy Spirit also came to Jesus Christ as the divine power for the anointing of Christ (Matt. 3:16). This was economical and was for Christ&#8217;s ministry and work, whereas the coming of the Spirit as the divine essence was essential and was for the Lord&#8217;s being and living. When He came forth at the age of thirty to minister and work for God, He needed the Spirit as His power economically.<p>Matthew 3:16 says, &#8220;He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him.&#8221; Before the Spirit of God descended and came upon the Lord Jesus, He had already been born of the Spirit, which proved that He had the Spirit within Him. That was for His birth. Now, for His ministry, the Spirit of God descended upon Him. This was for the fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1; 42:1; and Psalm 45:7 to anoint Christ for His ministry.<p>The Lord Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Holy Spirit, and constituted of the Holy Spirit. The Spirit was His constituent. Nevertheless, He still needed the baptism of the Holy Spirit, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. When He was in the womb of the virgin Mary, He was constituted of the Holy Spirit. That was something inward. Outwardly, He still needed the Holy Spirit to come upon Him as divine power. The Holy Spirit&#8217;s conceiving of Jesus was essential, related to the being, the person, of Jesus. The essence of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s element in the conception of Jesus is unchangeable and cannot be removed. However, the Holy Spirit&#8217;s descending upon Christ was economical, related to the ministry, the work, of Jesus. The power of the Holy Spirit for the ministry of Jesus (Luke 4:1, 14, 18; Matt. 12:28) is removable according to the condition of need for it. Before the Holy Spirit in power descended upon the Lord Jesus, He already had the Holy Spirit in essence from His birth. Furthermore, while the Holy Spirit in power was descending upon Him, He was existing with the Holy Spirit in essence.<p>Christ&#8217;s person is His being, His existence, and His work is His ministry. For His person He had the Holy Spirit as His intrinsic essence from the time of His conception. This is the Spirit for the Lord&#8217;s being, for His existence. He was constituted of the Holy Spirit as the intrinsic essence of His being when He was conceived in the womb of the virgin Mary. Hence, He was born with the Holy Spirit as His essence. In other words, He was born with the essential Spirit for His person, being, existence.<p>For thirty years the Lord Jesus lived on earth by the Holy Spirit as the intrinsic essence of His person. Then at the age of thirty He came forth to work. For His ministry He needed the Holy Spirit in a further way, not essentially but economically. After Christ was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him in bodily form as a dove. This was the Holy Spirit coming upon the Lord Jesus economically for the carrying out of God&#8217;s economy through the Lord&#8217;s ministry.<p>It is crucial for us to see these two aspects of the coming of the Spirit to Jesus Christ-the essential aspect and the economical aspect. The essential aspect of the Holy Spirit was for the person, the being, the existence, of the Lord Jesus. The economical aspect of the Spirit was for the Lord&#8217;s work, for His ministry. Therefore, the Spirit came to Jesus Christ in two ways: in the essential way for His conceiving and birth so that He might be a God-man and live the life of a God-man; in the economical way as the divine power so that Christ might carry out His ministry and work for God. In these two ways the Spirit came to the Lord Jesus.<h2 class=head1>D. TO THE SAINTS IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD BETWEEN CHRIST&#8217;S INCARNATION AND RESURRECTION</h2><p>According to God&#8217;s economy, there was a transitional period between Christ&#8217;s incarnation and resurrection. The Spirit came to certain saints during this period, which lasted about thirty-three and a half years. John the Baptist and Mary, the mother of Jesus, are not included among these saints, for John was filled with the Spirit and Mary was overshadowed by the Spirit before the beginning of this transitional period. Neither did the Spirit come to the Lord&#8217;s disciples during this period. For example, the Lord Jesus cast out demons by the Spirit of God (Matt. 12:28). Although the disciples were given authority by the Lord to cast out demons and did cast them out (Mark 3:15; 6:7; Luke 10:17), there is no verse telling us that they cast out demons by the Spirit. Furthermore, when Peter received the revelation that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God (Matt. 16:16), the Lord Jesus said that Peter was blessed, not because this was revealed by the Spirit but because it was revealed by the Father (v. 17). During the transitional period between His incarnation and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was the unique one to minister by the Holy Spirit. During this time the Spirit also came to Elizabeth, Zachariah, and Simeon.<h2 class=head2>1. To Elizabeth-Filling Her Economically</h2><p>Concerning Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist, Luke 1:41 says, &#8220;It came about as Elizabeth heard Mary&#8217;s greeting, that the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Once again, the Greek word translated &#8220;filled&#8221; is pletho, denoting the outward filling economically. Because Elizabeth was filled with the Spirit economically, she could utter the marvelous blessing recorded in verses 42 through 45, something she could not do by herself. Elizabeth&#8217;s blessing by the Holy Spirit reveals Christ&#8217;s humanity as the fruit of Mary&#8217;s womb (v. 42) and His deity as the Lord (v. 43). Being filled with the Holy Spirit, Elizabeth recognized the fruit of Mary&#8217;s womb as her Lord. This indicates that she acknowledged the deity of the child to be born of Mary. Moreover, she could confirm Mary&#8217;s faith in the Lord&#8217;s word by saying, &#8220;Blessed is she who believed, because there shall be a completion of the things spoken to her from the Lord&#8221; (v. 45). This was a prophecy by the Holy Spirit to confirm the Lord&#8217;s word spoken to Mary by the angel Gabriel (Luke 1:30-37).<h2 class=head2>2. To Zachariah-Filling Him Economically</h2><p>In the transitional period the Holy Spirit also came to Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist. According to Luke 1:67, Zachariah was filled with the Spirit and prophesied. In verse 68 Zachariah says, &#8220;Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and accomplished redemption for His people.&#8221; Here Zachariah prophesies regarding God&#8217;s redemptive move for His people unto their salvation. In verse 69 he speaks of Christ&#8217;s humanity as the &#8220;horn of salvation for us in the house of David,&#8221; and in verse 78, of Christ&#8217;s deity as &#8220;the rising sun from on high.&#8221; Zachariah&#8217;s prophecy sheds more light concerning God&#8217;s move on earth than is shed by Elizabeth&#8217;s blessing. In his prophecy we also have a revelation of Christ in His divine human person and saving work.<h2 class=head2>3. To Simeon-Being upon Him, Filling Him Economically</h2><p>Finally, during this transitional period the Spirit came to Simeon, being upon him and filling him economically. &#8220;The Holy Spirit was upon him. And it was communicated to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he should see the Lord&#8217;s Christ. And he came in the Spirit into the temple&#8221; (Luke 2:25b-27a). Therefore, Simeon&#8217;s adoration of Jesus was in the Holy Spirit. In his words of adoration (vv. 29-34) the Lord Jesus is revealed as the consolation of Israel, God&#8217;s salvation, a light for the Gentiles, a glory of Israel, a test to Israel, and a sign opposed.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS COMING</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>In the foregoing message we covered the Spirit&#8217;s coming to John the Baptist, to Mary the mother of Jesus, to Jesus Christ, and to the saints in the transitional period between Christ&#8217;s incarnation and resurrection. Now we shall go on to consider the Spirit&#8217;s coming to the New Testament believers.<h2 class=head1>E. TO THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS</h2><p>We have seen that the Spirit came to Jesus Christ in two ways. First, the Spirit came essentially for the Lord&#8217;s being, His existence. Second, the Spirit came to Him economically for His work, His ministry. In principle, both aspects of the Holy Spirit are the same with us as they were with the Lord Jesus. With Him there was the essential aspect for His being and the economical aspect for His ministry. With us there is also the essential aspect of the Spirit for our spiritual existence as regenerated believers, and there is the outward aspect of the Spirit for our Christian work. Therefore, we need to see how the Spirit comes to the New Testament believers both essentially and economically.<h2 class=head2>1. Essentially</h2><h2 class=head3>a. Asked of the Father by the Son</h2><p>First, the Holy Spirit was asked of the Father by the Son. John 14:16 says, &#8220;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter.&#8221; This other Comforter is the Spirit of reality (v. 17). The Son requested the Father to give the Spirit. The first Comforter, Jesus, asked the Father to send the second Comforter, the Spirit of reality of the first Comforter.<p>John 14:16 reveals that the Three of the Godhead work together to give us the Spirit. The Spirit&#8217;s coming to the believers thus involves the divine Trinity. This is indicated by the fact that the Son asked the Father to give us the Spirit. Whereas the Son&#8217;s coming was initiated by the Godhead, by the Triune God, the Spirit&#8217;s coming to the believers was initiated by the Son when He asked the Father to send the Spirit. The second of the Trinity asked the first to send the third.<h2 class=head3>b. Given by the Father</h2><p>The Spirit was given by the Father in answering the asking of the Son (John 14:16b; Luke 11:13). The Son requested that the Father give the Spirit, and the Father sent the Spirit at the request of the Son. The third of the Trinity was sent by the first in answer to the request of the second.<h2 class=head3>c. Sent in the Son&#8217;s Name by the Father</h2><p>The Spirit was sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name. In John 14:26 the Lord Jesus speaks of &#8220;the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name.&#8221; The Spirit was sent in the Son&#8217;s name, not in His own name. The first sent the third in the name of the second. For the Spirit to be sent by the Father in the name of the Son means that He was sent as the Son. Here we see that the coming of the Spirit to the believers is a complicated matter. The Spirit came, but He came in the Son&#8217;s name; that is, He came as the Son.<p>The Comforter, the Holy Spirit, was sent by the Father in the Son&#8217;s name. Hence, the Spirit comes in the Son&#8217;s name to be the reality of His name. The name is the Son Himself, and the Spirit is the person, the being, of the Son. When we call on the name of the Son, we receive the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:3). The Son came in the Father&#8217;s name (John 5:43) because the Son and the Father are one (John 10:30). Then the Spirit came in the Son&#8217;s name because the Spirit and the Son also are one (2 Cor. 3:17-18). This is the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-reaching us eventually as the Spirit.<h2 class=head3>d. Sent from with the Father by the Son</h2><p>John 15:26 tells us that the Spirit was sent from with the Father by the Son. The Greek preposition translated &#8220;from&#8221; in this verse has the sense of &#8220;from with.&#8221; The Spirit was sent by the Son not only from the Father but also with the Father. The Spirit comes from the Father and with the Father. The Father is the source. When the Spirit comes from the source, He does not leave the source. Rather, the source comes with Him.<p>In John 15:26 the Lord Jesus said that He would send the Spirit from with the Father. But in John 14:26 He said that the Father would send the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name. Then who sent the Spirit-the Father or the Son? We must say that the Spirit was sent by both the Father and the Son. The Father and the Son are one. The Father&#8217;s sending is the Son&#8217;s sending, and the Son&#8217;s sending is the Father&#8217;s sending. Having been sent by both the Father and the Son, the Spirit was sent with the Father and in the name of the Son. Once again we see the Triune God. When the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father in the Son&#8217;s name. Thus, all three of the Godhead are involved.<p>According to John 14:26 and 15:26, there are two senders of the Spirit. These two (the Father and the Son) sent one (the Spirit) as two (the Spirit and the Son). The one sent-the Spirit-was actually sent as two because He was sent in the name of the Son and thus as the Son. In this sense the Son is both the sender and a sent one. The Father sent the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name, and the Son sent the Spirit from with the Father. Therefore, these two senders sent one as two. When the Spirit came as the one sent, He did not come by Himself but with the Father. From this we see that eventually it was the Triune God who came as the Spirit.<p>In a simple word, we may say that the Triune God sent the Triune God. According to John 14:26, the first of the Trinity sent the third. But when the third was sent, He was sent as the second. Furthermore, according to John 15:26, the third was sent not only by the first but also by the second. When the third came, He came as the second and with the first. Therefore, the Triune God actually sent the Triune God. When one sent, all sent. When one came, all came.<p>We have seen that there are two senders of the Spirit- the Father and the Son. We have also seen that the Spirit came as two-the Spirit and the Son-and that the Spirit came with the Father. Therefore, the one sent is three. However, we still need to see that the sender, and not only the one sent, is also three. This requires that the Spirit, as well as the Father and the Son, be the sender. This matter is indicated in John 14:26.<p>As we study John 14:26, we need to consider what the phrase &#8220;in My name&#8221; modifies. This can be interpreted in two ways. First, it may mean that the Father in the Son&#8217;s name sent the Spirit. Second, it may mean that the Father sent the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name. Did the Father in the Son&#8217;s name send the Spirit, or did the Father send the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name? Was the sending one in the Son&#8217;s name or the sent one in the Son&#8217;s name? This is ambiguous not only in English but also in the Greek text. &#8220;In the Son&#8217;s name&#8221; means &#8220;as the Son.&#8221; Did the Father as the Son send the Spirit, or did the Father send the Spirit as the Son? If the Father in the Son&#8217;s name sent the Spirit, this means that the sending Father and the Son are one. If the Father sent the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name, this means that the Spirit and the Son are one.<p>The Father sending the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name indicates that the Spirit and the Son are one. Because the Spirit and the Son are one, the Spirit can be sent by the Father as the Son. This indicates strongly that the Spirit is the Son. The Father sending the Spirit in the Son&#8217;s name means that the Father sent the Spirit as the Son. This verse may also mean that when the Father was sending the Spirit, He was doing this sending as the Son. In other words, the Father, in the Son&#8217;s name, sent the Spirit. This indicates that the Son and the Father are one. Despite the ambiguity here, both interpretations are correct. John 14:26 first indicates that the Father sent the Spirit as the Son. Second, it indicates that the Father as the Son sent the Spirit. The Father sending the Spirit as the Son indicates that the Son is the Spirit. The Father as the Son sending the Spirit indicates that the Son is the Father. Therefore, the ambiguity of this verse indicates that the Son is both the Father and the Spirit. Moreover, the Son is both the sender and the sent one. Since the Spirit is one with the Son and the Son is the sender, so the Spirit is also the sender.<p>The phrase &#8220;in My name&#8221; in John 14:26 modifies both the Father who sent the Spirit and the Spirit who was sent. This indicates that the Son, in whose name the Father sent the Spirit and in whose name the Spirit was sent by the Father, is both the Father who sent and the Spirit who was sent. Since the Spirit as the one sent is one with the Son and the Son is the sender, the Spirit must also be the sender. This means that the sender, as well as the sent one, is three. Therefore, the Triune God sent the Triune God.<h2 class=head3>e. Given by the Son</h2><p>The Spirit has been given by the Son (John 3:34). The Spirit was also given by the Father (John 14:16b; Luke 11:13). Just as there are two senders of the Spirit, there are also two givers. The fact that both the Father and the Son have given the Spirit is a strong proof that the Son and the Father are one.<p>John 3:34 says that the Son &#8220;gives the Spirit not by measure.&#8221; This indicates that the Spirit given by the Son is immeasurable. The word &#8220;immeasurable&#8221; denotes not only the sphere of the Spirit but also the content and nature of the Spirit. The immeasurable Spirit is immeasurable in sphere. It is immeasurable also in content and nature, that is, in what the Spirit is. The immeasurable Spirit is actually the all-inclusive compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. The immeasurable Spirit as the all-inclusive compound Spirit is not simply the Spirit of power or the Spirit of life. This immeasurable Spirit is actually the consummate expression of the Triune God. Such a Spirit has been given by the Son.<h2 class=head3>f. The Son as the Last Adam Becoming the Spirit</h2><p>Concerning the giving of the Spirit to the New Testament believers, the Son as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This is the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God. Before the incarnation, the Triune God was &#8220;raw,&#8221; unprocessed. Through incarnation He was processed to become the last Adam. The Word, who is God, became flesh (John 1:1, 14). This was a process, and in this process He was &#8220;baked&#8221; to become the bread of life (John 6:35). The point here is that whereas the Triune God was raw before incarnation, through incarnation He began to enter into a process.<p>After nine months in the virgin Mary&#8217;s womb, the child who was the mighty God (Isa. 9:6) was born and placed in a manger (Luke 2:12). Later, the magi honored and worshipped Him as the very God (Matt. 2:11). For thirty years He lived in a carpenter&#8217;s house. He Himself worked as a carpenter and was called a carpenter (Mark 6:3). Eventually He was crucified, being on the cross for six hours. He was buried and went to Hades, even descending into the lower parts of the earth (Eph. 4:9). Then He entered into resurrection, and in resurrection He, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit. All this was a process. The Triune God was processed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.<p>The process through which the Triune God passed to become the life-giving Spirit is an economical, not essential, matter. Change with God can only be economical; it can never be essential. Essentially, our God cannot change. From eternity to eternity He remains the same in His essence. But in His economy the Triune God has changed in the sense of being processed. First, He who was merely God became a God-man. When He was merely God, He did not have humanity. But when He changed by becoming a God-man, humanity was added to His divinity. This does not mean, however, that God changed in His essence. On the contrary, He was changed only in His economy, in His dispensation. God has changed in His economy, but He has never changed in His essence.<p>Although God has changed in His economy, no longer will He change economically. Rather, He will remain the same. This is the reason Hebrews 13:8 says, &#8220;Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and forever.&#8221; Before &#8220;yesterday&#8221; Jesus Christ did change economically. He changed by becoming a man. He changed in resurrection by becoming the life-giving Spirit. But now, after His resurrection, Jesus Christ remains the same. In Hebrews 13:8, a verse written after Christ&#8217;s incarnation and resurrection, the word &#8220;yesterday&#8221; counts from the day of His resurrection. Christ&#8217;s &#8220;today&#8221; is today, and His &#8220;forever&#8221; includes the coming age and eternity. Therefore, it is a mistake to use this verse as the basis for claiming that the Triune God cannot change economically. First Christ became a man through incarnation, and then He became the life-giving Spirit through resurrection. Now that He is the life-giving Spirit He will remain forever the same.<p>On the one hand, Christ, the Son, became the Spirit. On the other hand, the Spirit, who was sent in the Son&#8217;s name, came as the Son. In resurrection the Son did not simply become absolutely one with the Spirit-He became the Spirit. Now this Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God reaching us. Through Christ&#8217;s resurrection the coming of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit was completed.<h2 class=head3>g. Breathed into the Believers by the Son in Resurrection</h2><p>The Spirit was breathed into the believers by the Son in resurrection. &#8220;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&#8221; (John 20:22). The Holy Spirit here is actually the resurrected Christ Himself because this Spirit is His breath. The Holy Spirit is thus the breath of the Son. The Greek word for Spirit in this verse is pneuma, a word that is used for breath, spirit, and wind. Therefore, this verse can be translated, &#8220;Receive the holy breath.&#8221; On the day of His resurrection the Lord Jesus breathed Himself into His disciples as the holy breath.<p>The Christ who breathed Himself into the disciples is the life-giving Spirit. The resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the breath. Some theologians use the term &#8220;the pneumatic Christ&#8221; to refer to the Christ who is the Spirit, the breath. After the Lord Jesus accomplished all of His processes, He became the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is the pneumatic Christ. Such a One, the pneumatic Christ as the Spirit, came to His disciples and breathed Himself as the Spirit into them. From that time onward He was truly one with His disciples, for He became the intrinsic being of His disciples essentially. In John 20:22 the resurrected Christ, the pneumatic Christ, Christ as the Spirit, entered into His believers to be the divine essence of their spiritual life and being.<h2 class=head3>h. As the Ultimate Consummation of the Processed Triune God Supplied to the Believers by God as the Blessing of the Gospel of His New Testament Economy</h2><p>The second step of the completion of the Spirit&#8217;s coming is that the Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God is supplied to the believers by God as the blessing of the gospel of His New Testament economy (Gal. 3:5, 14). The blessing of the New Testament gospel is not going to heaven; neither is it merely the forgiveness of sins and eternal life, although these matters are wonderful. The blessing of the gospel is the all-inclusive Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God supplied to us. This is the blessing, the ultimate blessing, the all-inclusive blessing, the blessing that embraces every divine thing given and supplied to us. We know that we have received this blessing because we have the realization that the life-giving Spirit is within us. This is the confirmation that we have received the all-inclusive blessing of the New Testament gospel, a blessing that is a wonderful Person-the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God.<p>Galatians 3:14 says, &#8220;That the blessing of Abraham might come to the nations in Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.&#8221; Because this verse combines the promise of the Spirit with the blessing of Abraham, it is extremely important. The blessing of Abraham is the blessing promised by God to Abraham (Gen. 12:3) for all the nations of the earth. This promise was fulfilled, and this blessing has come to the nations in Christ through His redemption by the cross. The context of Galatians 3:14 indicates that the Spirit is the blessing which God promised to Abraham for all nations and which has been received by the believers through faith in Christ. The Spirit is the compound Spirit and is actually the Triune God Himself processed through incarnation for us to receive as our life and our everything. This is the focus of the gospel of God.<p>The physical aspect of the blessing God promised to Abraham was the good land (Gen. 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4), which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ (Col. 1:12). Because Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the promised land. Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God&#8217;s bountiful supply for us to enjoy.<p>The compound Spirit we have received as the blessing of the New Testament gospel is the all-inclusive, compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. The compounding of the spices with the olive oil to produce the ointment typifies the compounding of Christ&#8217;s humanity, death, and resurrection with the Spirit of God to produce the all-inclusive Spirit. This Spirit is the bountiful supply to the believers in God&#8217;s New Testament economy (Phil. 1:19). By faith we have received this Spirit as the blessing of the gospel promised to Abraham by God. As the processed Triune God, the Spirit is the full realization of the all-inclusive Christ as the good land. This is the Spirit as the total blessing of the gospel.<h2 class=head3>i. Received by the Believers</h2><p>The Spirit is received by the believers. Galatians 3:2 indicates that we received the Spirit by the hearing of faith. Through hearing the gospel we believed in the crucified Christ, but we received the Spirit. The One who was crucified was Christ, but the One who enters into the believers is the Spirit. This is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who is the ultimate blessing of the gospel. The believers receive such a divine Spirit by the hearing of faith, not by works of law. The Spirit enters into the believers and lives in them, not by their keeping the law, but by their faith in the crucified and resurrected Christ.<h2 class=head2>2. Economically</h2><p>We have considered nine aspects of the coming of the Spirit to the New Testament believers essentially for their spiritual life and being. Now we need to consider the coming of the Spirit economically. The coming of the Spirit to the believers economically is for their spiritual ministry and work.<h2 class=head3>a. Promised by God the Father</h2><p>First, the coming of the Spirit economically was promised by God the Father. This promise was given in the second chapter of Joel and is quoted by Peter in Acts 2:17 and 18. These verses speak of the pouring out of the Spirit. The pouring out of the Spirit upon all flesh differs from the breathing of the Spirit into the disciples out of the mouth of Christ after His resurrection. The pouring out of God&#8217;s Spirit was from the heavens after Christ&#8217;s ascension. The former is the essential aspect of the Spirit breathed into the believers as life for their living; the latter is the economical aspect of the Spirit poured out upon them as power for their work. The same Spirit is both within the believers essentially and upon them economically. The word &#8220;upon&#8221; in Acts 2:17 is economically different from the essential &#8220;in&#8221; in John 14:17. &#8220;In&#8221; is related to the intrinsic essence for life; &#8220;upon&#8221; is related to the outward element for power.<h2 class=head3>b. Promised by the Son Referring to the Father&#8217;s Promise</h2><p>First, the Father promised the coming of the Spirit economically in the Old Testament through the prophet Joel. Then the coming of the Spirit was promised by the Son through His referring to the Father&#8217;s promise. This is clearly revealed in Luke 24:49 and Acts 1:5 and 8. In Luke 24:49 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;Behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you.&#8221; This promise was of the outpouring of the Spirit as power from on high for the believers&#8217; ministry economically. In Acts 1:5 and 8 the Lord Jesus reminded the believers concerning the promise of the Father, telling them that they would be baptized in the Holy Spirit and thereby receive power by the Holy Spirit coming upon them.<h2 class=head3>c. Received from the Father and Poured Out upon the Believers by Christ in His Ascension</h2><p>Finally, in His ascension Christ received the economical Spirit from the Father and poured out this Spirit upon the believers. Acts 2:33 says, &#8220;Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He poured out this which you both see and hear.&#8221; The exalted Christ&#8217;s receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit was actually the receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself. Christ was conceived of the Spirit essentially for His being in humanity, and He was anointed with the Spirit economically for His ministry among men. After His resurrection and ascension, He still needed to receive the Spirit economically again so that He might pour out this Spirit upon His Body to carry out on earth His heavenly ministry for the accomplishment of God&#8217;s New Testament economy. The same Spirit who was breathed into the believers essentially as life in Christ&#8217;s resurrection was poured out upon them economically by Christ in His ascension. In and after His ascension Christ received the all-inclusive Spirit from the Father economically and poured Him out upon the believers for their ministry and work.<p>We have seen the way in which the Spirit comes to us. The Spirit was sent by the Triune God, and He came as the Triune God. Hence, the coming of the Spirit is actually a matter of the Triune God sending the Triune God. Now as New Testament believers we have the consummated Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God within us essentially as our life and upon us economically as our authority and power.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><p>We have covered the Spirit&#8217;s person, symbols, attributes, and coming. Now we shall go on to the Spirit&#8217;s work. We shall consider the Spirit&#8217;s work on John the Baptist, on the saints in the transitional period, in Christ, and in the believers for the divine dispensing.<h2 class=head1>A. ON JOHN THE BAPTIST</h2><p>First, the Spirit worked on John the Baptist. The Spirit filled him with power to carry out his ministry. According to Luke 1:15, John the Baptist was filled with the Spirit in this way from his mother&#8217;s womb.<h2 class=head1>B. ON THE SAINTS IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD</h2><p>Second, the Spirit worked on the saints in the transitional period between Christ&#8217;s incarnation and resurrection. These saints-Elizabeth, Zachariah, and Simeon-were filled with the Spirit economically (Luke 1:41, 67; 2:25). In particular, the Spirit communicated to Simeon that &#8220;he would not see death before he should see the Lord&#8217;s Christ&#8221; (Luke 2:26). The Spirit also inspired him to speak prophetically concerning Christ (Luke 2:27-35).<h2 class=head1>C. IN CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>1. Working Out His Conception and Bringing Him Forth</h2><p>The Spirit worked in Christ by working out His conception and bringing Him forth. In Christ the Father&#8217;s divine essence was mingled with the human essence by the Spirit. Through the overshadowing of the Holy Spirit, the divine essence was generated in Mary&#8217;s womb (Luke 1:35) so that she was &#8220;with child of the Holy Spirit&#8221; (Matt. 1:18). Thus, that which was begotten in her was of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 1:20). The birth of Christ was directly of the Holy Spirit. This Spirit was the Spirit of God the Father, the essence of God the Father. When the Spirit entered in through the womb of Mary, that was the essence of God the Father entering into the virgin. This was a divine conception accomplished in the womb of a human virgin. The divine essence was mingled with the human essence to produce a child born as a God-man. The Son was conceived with the Father&#8217;s essence and by the Spirit. As the God-man, Christ has two natures-divinity and humanity. The work in Him related to His divinity was absolutely a work done by the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>2. Descending and Abiding upon Him</h2><p>The Spirit continued His work in Christ by descending upon Him and abiding upon Him. When Christ came out to minister, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him and abode upon Him as the economical power for His work. At the age of thirty the Lord Jesus was baptized. After He came out of the water, the Spirit of God descended as a dove and came upon Him (Matt. 3:16). The Lord had been born of the Spirit, the Spirit was one of the essences of His being, and He had the Holy Spirit within Him. Essentially He already had the Spirit of life for His existence. But economically for His ministry He still needed the Spirit of power. Therefore, at the time of His baptism the Holy Spirit came upon Him economically, and this economical Spirit abode upon Him (John 1:33).<h2 class=head2>3. As the Means for God to Anoint Him</h2><p>When the Lord Jesus was ministering and working, the Spirit was the means for God to anoint Him. The Lord was absolutely under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. In Luke 4:18 the words of Isaiah are applied to Christ: &#8220;The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor.&#8221; Acts 10:38 tells us that God anointed Jesus with the Holy Spirit and power. Furthermore, Matthew 12:18 reveals that God put His Spirit on Christ for the announcing of judgment to the nations. Hebrews 1:9 tells us that God has anointed Christ with the oil of exultant joy. All these verses show the work of the Spirit in God&#8217;s anointing of Christ. Although Christ is the almighty God, He, as God&#8217;s Christ in His humanity, still needed to be anointed with the Spirit for His ministry to carry out God&#8217;s economy. Therefore, when Christ worked, He worked by the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>4. Filling Him Essentially</h2><p>Luke 4:1 says, &#8220;Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan.&#8221; This verse indicates that while the Lord Jesus was working, He was filled with the Holy Spirit inwardly and essentially. In the New Testament the phrase &#8220;full of the Holy Spirit&#8221; refers to an inward, essential filling for living, not an outward, economical filling for working (Acts 6:3, 5; 7:55; 11:24). &#8220;Full of the Spirit&#8221; is the condition after being filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially. The Greek word for &#8220;full&#8221; in Luke 4:1, pleres, the adjective form of pleroo, signifies an inward filling. A particular aspect of the Spirit&#8217;s work in Christ was to fill Him inwardly, essentially, for life.<h2 class=head2>5. Leading Him</h2><p>Matthew 4:1 says, &#8220;Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness.&#8221; After being baptized in water and anointed with the Spirit of God, Jesus, as a man, moved according to the leading of the Spirit. This indicates that His ministry in His humanity was according to the Spirit. The Holy Spirit was always leading Him. The Spirit led the Lord Jesus concerning where He should go, what He should do, what He should speak, and whom He should contact.<h2 class=head2>6. Empowering Him</h2><p>Luke 4:14 says, &#8220;Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee.&#8221; The Spirit here is the Holy Spirit who descended upon the Lord Jesus at the time of His baptism for the accomplishment of His ministry and who filled Him essentially (v. 1). Therefore, Christ had the Holy Spirit both essentially as life for His being and economically as power for His ministry. In Luke 4:14 we see that the Holy Spirit empowered Christ economically. The Spirit was continually working to empower the Lord Jesus to carry out God&#8217;s commission.<h2 class=head2>7. As the Means for His Exultation</h2><p>Luke 10:21 tells us that Christ &#8220;exulted in the Holy Spirit and said, I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because You have hid these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing in Your sight.&#8221; This indicates that the Spirit was the means for Christ&#8217;s exultation. He lived in the Holy Spirit and therefore exulted in the Spirit. In His exulting in the Holy Spirit Christ praised the Father, the Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding the knowledge of the Son and the Father from the wise and intelligent and revealing it to babes. With praise, the Son acknowledged the Father&#8217;s way to carry out His economy. This Christ did by the Spirit as the means of His exultation.<h2 class=head2>8. As the Means for Him to Cast Out Demons</h2><p>In Matthew 12:28 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you.&#8221; This word indicates that Christ fought the battle for the kingdom by the Spirit. The Spirit of God is the power of the kingdom of God. Where the Spirit of God is in power, there the kingdom of God is, and there the demons have no ground. Wherever the Spirit of God exercises authority over the opposing situation, that is the kingdom of God. Thus, the Spirit was the means and the power for Christ to cast out demons.<h2 class=head2>9. Testifying concerning Christ</h2><p>Another aspect of the Spirit&#8217;s work is to testify concerning Christ. John 15:26 says, &#8220;When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father, He will testify concerning Me.&#8221; Here we see that the Spirit, sent by the Son and coming with the Father, will testify concerning the Son. After Christ&#8217;s resurrection, the Spirit, as Christ&#8217;s living witness, began to testify of Christ&#8217;s reality.<p>The Spirit as the Spirit of the resurrected Christ comes to testify concerning the Son and to glorify Him (John 16:14). As the transfiguration of the Son, the Spirit makes the Son real to the believers in their experience. This is to testify concerning the Son. Apart from the Spirit&#8217;s testifying, the Son would be merely objective to the believers and could not be subjective to them in their experiences of Him.<p>When the Spirit discloses what the Son is to the believers and makes Him real to them in their life, the Son is glorified. By this the Son becomes the believers&#8217; life within and their expression without. This is to glorify the Son.<p>In particular, as the context of John 15 reveals, the Spirit of reality testifies concerning the Son as the vine (v. 1). The Spirit testifies in the presence of the persecuting religion. Furthermore, the Spirit testifies to the branches and through the branches to the world. Religion may persecute, but the Spirit of reality testifies that the Son is the true vine.<h2 class=head2>10. Vindicating Him as God Manifested in the Flesh</h2><p>First Timothy 3:16 reveals that the Spirit also works to vindicate Christ as God manifested in the flesh. The Greek word translated &#8220;vindicated&#8221; in this verse may also be rendered &#8220;justified.&#8221; The incarnated Christ in His human living was vindicated as the Son of God by the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; Rom. 1:3-4) and was also justified, proved, and approved as right and righteous by the Spirit (Matt. 3:15-16; 4:1). He was manifested in the flesh but vindicated and justified in the Spirit. He appeared in the flesh, but He lived in the Spirit (Luke 4:1, 14; Matt. 12:28) and offered Himself to God through the Spirit (Heb. 9:14). His transfiguration (Matt. 17:2) and His resurrection were both vindications of the Spirit. Furthermore, in resurrection He even became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45; 2 Cor. 3:17) to dwell and live in us (Rom. 8:9-10) for the manifestation of God in the flesh as the mystery of godliness. Hence, now we know Christ and His members no longer according to the flesh but according to the Spirit (2 Cor. 5:16). Because the manifestation of God in the flesh is vindicated in the Spirit, and the Spirit is one with our spirit (Rom 8:16), we must live and behave in our spirit that this vindication may be accomplished.<p>According to 1 Timothy 3:16, the Spirit vindicates the manifestation of God in the flesh. This took place in Christ while He was on earth. He was God manifested in the flesh, and this was vindicated and verified by the Spirit. The same principle applies to us, the church, today. God is manifested in our flesh, but this needs to be verified, justified, and vindicated by the all-inclusive Spirit. In a very real sense, the church today is the manifestation of God in the flesh. This manifestation needs to be vindicated or justified by the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit is working to vindicate, justify, testify, and confirm that the church is God&#8217;s manifestation. Although the church is still in the flesh, the church is such a manifestation of God, a manifestation that is vindicated by the Holy Spirit. In actuality, only when we live in the all-inclusive Spirit is there the vindication and verification that God is manifested in us, the church.<h2 class=head2>11. As the Means for Him to Offer Himself to God</h2><p>The Spirit was the means for Christ to offer Himself to God. Hebrews 9:14 tells us that through the eternal Spirit Christ offered Himself without blemish to God. This means that while Christ was working to offer Himself to God as a sacrifice, He was working by the eternal Spirit. Christ and the eternal Spirit worked together to present Christ to God as the unique offering to accomplish redemption for God&#8217;s eternal salvation.<p>Because the means by which Christ offered Himself to God was the eternal Spirit, what was accomplished by that offering is eternal-eternal redemption. Christ&#8217;s offering accomplished an eternal redemption because it is an eternal offering. Because Christ&#8217;s redemption is eternal, it surpasses time and space; it is everlasting in time and all-prevailing in space. The eternal Spirit has made the death of Christ eternally efficacious. The accomplishment of His death covers all the believing Old Testament saints and all the New Testament believers. Although Christ died on Calvary nearly two thousand years ago and many miles away from us, His death is applicable and available to us because it was accomplished through the eternal Spirit. His eternal death is available and applicable to all persons in any place and at any time. Therefore, whoever believes in Christ has the eternal redemption, accomplished through the eternal Spirit, applied to him. Whenever we contact the Spirit today, we touch the reality of Christ&#8217;s eternal offering. Because we are partakers of the Spirit, we are also partakers of the unique offering, partakers of eternal redemption. Once we become a partaker of the Spirit, we partake of everything related to the Spirit.<p>Christ labored, worked, and lived on earth through the eternal Spirit. Whatever the Lord Jesus accomplished and experienced in His living, labor, and work has been made eternal by the eternal Spirit. This eternal Spirit is all-inclusive, and now we partake of such a Spirit.<h2 class=head2>12. As the Means for Him to Fill His Believers Essentially</h2><p>The Spirit is also the means for Christ to fill His believers essentially. This is revealed in John 20:22: &#8220;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This indicates that Christ filled the believers with the Spirit as the breath of life. This is a matter of the Spirit becoming the intrinsic essence of the believers&#8217; spiritual being. We may neglect the fact that before Christ poured out the Spirit upon the believers economically as power for their work, He breathed the Spirit into them essentially as life for their inward being. We need to be deeply impressed that Christ first filled His believers essentially and later poured out the Spirit upon them economically.<h2 class=head2>13. As the Means for Him to Give Command to His Disciples</h2><p>Acts 1:2 says that the resurrected Christ gave &#8220;command through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom He chose.&#8221; The resurrected Christ has become the life-giving Spirit, yet in resurrection He still did things through the Holy Spirit. In particular, He gave command to the disciples through the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>14. As the Means for Him, as the Head, to Baptize All His Believers into His Body</h2><p>Finally, the Spirit was the means for Christ, as the Head of the Body, to baptize all His believers into His Body (Matt. 3:11; Acts 1:5; 11:15-16; 1 Cor. 12:13). The New Testament reveals that Christ is the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit (Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; John 1:33). Concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit, the Lord Jesus said in Acts 1:5, &#8220;John indeed baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&#8221; This was accomplished in two steps, in two instances. First, on the day of Pentecost, Christ, the Head of the Body, having received the Spirit economically once again in His ascension, baptized the Jewish believers into the Spirit. That was the first step, the first instance, of Christ baptizing the Body into the Spirit. Then, in the house of Cornelius, Christ, the Head, baptized all the Gentile believers into the Spirit (Acts 10:44-47; 11:15-17). That was the second step, the second instance. By these two steps, these two instances, Christ, the Head of the Body, baptized His entire Body into the Spirit once for all.<p>Because Christ has baptized all His believers into His Body by means of the Spirit, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 12:13, &#8220;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.&#8221; As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, be this one Body. Christ is the life and constituent of this Body, and the Spirit is the reality of Christ. In this one Spirit we were all baptized by Christ into this one living Body to express Christ.<p>We have seen an overall view of the Spirit&#8217;s work in Christ. Christ does not live, move, and work apart from the Spirit. Rather, He is always one with the Spirit, and the Spirit is His means for His living the divine life and for doing everything.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(2)</h1><p>We have covered the Spirit&#8217;s work on John the Baptist, on the saints in the transitional period, and in Christ. Next we shall consider the work of the Spirit to convict the world. Then we shall go on to the many aspects of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers.<h2 class=head1>D. TO CONVICT THE WORLD</h2><p>John 16:8-11 reveals that the Spirit works to convict the world, mankind, concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment: &#8220;Having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.&#8221; The Spirit always convicts the world concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment. Sin entered through Adam (Rom. 5:12), righteousness is the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin (John 8:44). We were born of sin in Adam. The only way to be freed from sin is to believe in Christ, the Son of God. If we believe in Him, He will be righteousness to us, and we shall be justified in Him (Rom. 3:24; 4:25). If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ the Son of God, we shall remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity (Matt. 25:41).<p>In John 16:8-11 the convicting work of the Spirit is related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan. We all became fallen in Adam, but we may believe in Christ and be justified. Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from among the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him. Satan, the source of death, has been judged and destroyed through Christ&#8217;s death (Heb. 2:14). The three main items in these three verses are related to these three persons: sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan. We were born of Adam, but we have believed in Christ and have received Him as our righteousness. However, all those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan. Because they remain followers of Satan, they will have the same destiny as Satan.<p>When the Spirit comes, He convicts unbelievers, fallen sinners, of sin, righteousness, and judgment. Sinners, who are born in Adam, must believe in the resurrected Christ so that they may have Him as their righteousness. If they do not believe, they will be judged by God as Satan is. When the gospel is preached in a proper way, those who hear should have the desire not to remain in Adam but to be transferred into Christ. These people will then be regenerated and saved. To them the convicting Spirit will become the regenerating Spirit (John 3:6), the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2), and the Spirit of reality, dwelling within them (John 14:17).<p>The Spirit came to us to convict us of sin, righteousness, and judgment. We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan. We have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ. We have also become children of God and members of Christ. Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God, who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us.<h2 class=head1>E. IN THE BELIEVERS FOR THE DIVINE DISPENSING</h2><p>Let us now begin to consider the work of the Spirit in the believers for the divine dispensing. Although the Spirit works on the believers as well as in them, the main part of His work is in the believers, and only a small part is on them. Just as the Holy Spirit worked mainly in Christ and not on Him, so the Spirit works mainly in the believers and not on them. This work of the Spirit in the believers is for the divine dispensing.<h2 class=head2>1. Enlightening Them That They May Repent</h2><p>In Luke 15:8-9 the Spirit is likened to a woman finding a lost coin by lighting a lamp, sweeping the house, and seeking the coin carefully. This signifies that the Spirit enlightens sinners within their hearts by God&#8217;s word of light to seek them that they may repent unto God.<h2 class=head2>2. Sanctifying Them That They May Be Separated unto the Lord</h2><p>First Peter 1:2 indicates that the Spirit sanctifies, separates, repentant sinners unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, that is, unto the believing in the redemption of Christ that they may become the Lord&#8217;s. While the Spirit enlightens sinners, to seek them for God, He is sanctifying, separating, them unto the Lord.<h2 class=head2>3. Regenerating Them</h2><p>Followingly, the Spirit works in the believers by regenerating them (John 3:5-6). Regeneration is God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself in His life and nature into our being. Therefore, regeneration is the reality of the divine dispensing.<p>Even our natural, human birth involved a human dispensing. God created Adam, one person. Through generation, Adam&#8217;s life has been dispensed into billions of descendants. Generation, therefore, is a matter of dispensing. The entire human race is under such a human dispensing. The principle is the same with regeneration. Just as human generation is a matter of human dispensing, so divine regeneration is a matter of divine dispensing. We were generated in humanity, but God wants to regenerate us in divinity. This regeneration in divinity is a dispensing of divinity into humanity, a dispensing that makes humanity divine.<p>Regeneration is a matter of God&#8217;s dispensing of Himself into our being as our life and nature. As believers, regenerated ones, our nature and life are God Himself, not God in Himself but God in His dispensing. This view of regeneration as the reality of the divine dispensing should encourage us to live and walk in such a way that we remain under God&#8217;s dispensing.<p>In John 3:5 and 6 the Lord Jesus speaks of the Spirit&#8217;s work in regenerating the believers: &#8220;Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; The Spirit in verse 6 is the divine Spirit, the Holy Spirit of God, and the spirit is the human spirit, the regenerated spirit of man. To be regenerated, to be born anew (vv. 3, 7), is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit. The divine Spirit regenerates the human spirit with the divine life. Regeneration takes place in our spirit, which was made by God for this very purpose. Regeneration is a birth of the Spirit, God&#8217;s Spirit, that brings forth spirit, our regenerated spirit. Therefore, regeneration takes place in the human spirit by the Holy Spirit of God with God&#8217;s uncreated, eternal life. Once our spirit has been born of the Spirit of God with the life of God, it has the Spirit with the divine life in it and mingled with it. Our spirit becomes thereby a mingled spirit-the regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. In this mingled spirit we are &#8220;one spirit&#8221; with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17).<h2 class=head2>4. Giving Them Life</h2><p>We may talk about regeneration without realizing that in regeneration we have been given the divine life. The main work the Spirit does in regeneration is to impart the divine life, the eternal, uncreated life of God, into us. This means that the Spirit gives life to the believers.<p>Although Christ is life, it is difficult for Christ to give you life. It is the Spirit who gives life. Christ is life, but it is the Spirit who gives us Christ as life. Apart from the Spirit Christ may be life, but Christ as life cannot be given to us. By being the Spirit Christ is imparted into us as life. Today, after being processed, Christ is the life-giving Spirit. Now in our spirit we may enjoy this wonderful Spirit as the Spirit who gives us the divine life. Second Corinthians 3:6c and John 6:63 both reveal that the Spirit gives us life. Second Corinthians 3:6c says, &#8220;The Spirit gives life.&#8221; The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God becoming a life-giving Spirit, imparts the divine life, even God Himself into the believers. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus Himself declares, &#8220;It is the Spirit who gives life.&#8221; After resurrection and through resurrection the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh (John 1:14), became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45. It is as the life-giving Spirit that He can be the life and life supply to us. When we receive Him as the crucified and resurrected Savior, the Spirit who gives life comes into us to impart eternal life to us.<p>As believers we are persons with the divine life in us. We have received another life-eternal life-in addition to our human life. Now we need to learn to live not by the human life but by the divine life in the human life. This is not to live an exchanged life, the divine life exchanged for the human life; it is to live a mingled life, the divine life mingled with the human life. Now that we have two lives, we should not live in our human life apart from the divine life. On the contrary, we should live by the divine life in the human life. The giving of this divine life is a work done by the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>5. Saving Them by Renewing Them</h2><p>The Holy Spirit also works to save us by renewing us (Titus 3:5). In ourselves we are the old creation. As the old creation, we are old not only in appearance but also in nature. We are intrinsically old. We are old in every way, old both inwardly and outwardly. Because we are the old creation, we need not only regeneration but also the renewing of the Spirit that follows regeneration. After we have been regenerated, we need to be renewed little by little. Daily we should cooperate with the renewing work of the Spirit so that the process of His renewing within us may be speeded up.<p>Titus 3:5 says, &#8220;According to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here we see that God&#8217;s salvation is through a certain action: the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit. In Greek the word for regeneration in verse 5 is different from that for born again (1 Pet. 1:23). The only place this word is used is in Matthew 19:28 for the restoration of the millennium. Here it refers to a change from one state of things to another. To be born again is the beginning of this change. The washing of regeneration begins with our being born again and continues with the renewing of the Holy Spirit as the process of God&#8217;s new creation to make us a new man. It is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, remodeling, with life. Baptism (Rom. 6:3-5), the putting off of the old man, the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22, 24; Col. 3:9-11), and transformation by the renewing of the mind (Rom. 12:2; Eph. 4:23) are all related to this wonderful process. The washing of regeneration purges away all the things of the old nature of our old man, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit imparts something new-the divine essence of the new man-into our being. In this is a passage from the old state we were in into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation. Hence, both the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit are a continual working in us throughout our whole life until the completion of the new creation.<p>The Holy Spirit is the divine Person, washing and renewing us in the divine element to make us a new creation with the divine nature to be heirs of God in His eternal life, inheriting all the riches of the Triune God. The Spirit began to renew us from our regeneration and is renewing us continuously every day and all day to make us a new creation with the divine life.<h2 class=head2>6. Freeing Them by His Law of Life from the Law of Sin and Death</h2><p>As the Holy Spirit saves us by renewing us, He frees us by His law of life from the law of sin and death. In Romans 8:2 Paul says, &#8220;The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed me from the law of sin and of death.&#8221; In this verse &#8220;law&#8221; does not denote a commandment but a principle that operates automatically and spontaneously. A law is a natural regulation, a constant and unchanging rule. Every kind of life has such a law. The law of a certain life is the innate ability of that life. This ability is inborn, spontaneous, automatic, constant, and instant. Therefore, as long as a particular life exists and is free, it can naturally develop its characteristics and manifest its abilities. It does not require human teaching or urging; rather, it develops very naturally without the least effort. Such natural characteristics and innate capabilities in a life constitute the law of that life.<p>The life of God is the highest life, the life that surpasses every other kind of life. Thus, the characteristics and capabilities of the divine life are most high and surpassing. Because these highest and surpassing characteristics and capabilities constitute the law of the life of God, this law naturally is the most high and surpassing. Through regeneration we have received the life of God, the divine, eternal, uncreated life. Since by regeneration we have received the life of God, we have naturally received from the life of God the most high and surpassing law of this life.<p>In Romans 8:2 Paul speaks not merely of the law of life but of the law of the Spirit of life. The law of the Spirit of life is nothing less than the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit to dwell within us. This means that the processed Triune God is Himself the law of the Spirit of life. Just as sin is actually a person-Satan-so this law is also a person-the Triune God. Today our God is not only the mighty One, the Redeemer, and the Savior. He is even more than just our life and life supply-He is a law working within us. After being processed, the Triune God has been dispensed into us to become a law in us. Now He is not only something organic but also something automatic. Whatever this processed and indwelling Triune God does in us, with us, and on us is a function of the law. Our God is not merely an objective worker, working by activities outside of us and beyond us. Our God has become a subjective law, working all the time within us not by activities but by law. It is a wonderful fact that the highest law, the Triune God as the law of life, has been installed into us and now works within us not by activity but by law. He is a law operating within us, working not merely as the mighty God but as a law that operates automatically.<p>The two laws in Romans 8:2 are actually two persons. The law of sin and death is Satan, and the law of the Spirit of life is the Triune God. In order for Satan and the Triune God to become, respectively, the negative and positive laws operating in us, it was necessary for both persons to enter our being. If Satan had not come into man, he could not be the law of sin and death within man. In the same principle, if the Triune God had remained outside of us, He could not be to us the law of the Spirit of life. Because the Triune God has been processed and dispensed into us and now dwells in us, He has become to us the law of the Spirit of life. This law, which is the automatic and spontaneous divine power, is in our spirit. Therefore, this law, having the divine Spirit and eternal life as its elements, is powerful and dynamic.<p>The Spirit works in us to free us by His law of life from the law of sin and death. Apart from the working of the Spirit, the law of life is of no avail. This law is actualized in the Spirit. This means that the Spirit is the reality and practicality of the law of life, which now operates in us automatically.<p>Because the highest law, the law of the divine life, is operating within us, there is no need for us to strive to overcome the law of sin and death. Instead of striving, we should simply allow the law of the Spirit of life to work within us. But although this law works in us automatically, it still needs our cooperation through our faith and obedience. For such a cooperation we need to pray without ceasing to keep ourselves in the divine fellowship. If we do nut cooperate, the freeing Spirit, who is the law working within us, will be frustrated. But if we cooperate, the Spirit will operate by His law of life to free us from the law of sin and death.<p>Furthermore, as the Spirit works in this way, the Triune God is dispensed into our entire tripartite being, into our spirit, soul, and body. Through the working of the Spirit by His law of life the riches of the divine life are being dispensed into us. While the Spirit is saving and renewing us, He is dispensing the divine life into us. While He is freeing us, He is dispensing the elements of God&#8217;s life and nature into our being. Eventually, this dispensing will become our spiritual constitution. We shall be constituted of the divine elements through the dispensing work of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>7. Giving Life Even to Their Mortal Bodies</h2><p>The dispensing Spirit gives life even to our mortal bodies. Romans 8:11 says, &#8220;If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&#8221; This verse reveals that as the life-giving Spirit dwells in us, that is, makes His home in us, He will impart the divine life not only into our spirits and souls but even into our mortal bodies. Through the indwelling Spirit our bodies are enlivened by the divine life.<p>According to Romans 8:11, it is possible for divine, eternal life to be given to our mortal bodies. In this verse Paul says that if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will give life to our mortal bodies, and this will take place through the indwelling Spirit. When we put together verses 10, 6, and 11, we see that not only is our spirit life, and our mind life, if it is set on the spirit, but life may also be given to our mortal bodies through the Spirit.<p>The Bible reveals that, as human beings, we are tripartite. This means that we have a spirit, a soul, and a body. In Romans 8 we see that first our spirit becomes life through regeneration. Then if we are faithful to set our mind on our spirit, our mind will also become life. This will prepare the way for the Spirit to give life to our mortal bodies. As a result, our bodies will receive the divine life.<p>Romans 8:11 speaks of our &#8220;mortal bodies.&#8221; The word &#8220;mortal&#8221; indicates that our bodies are subject to death. However, if we contact the Lord when we are physically weak or sick, the Spirit will dispense the divine life into our weak and sick bodies. In this way our bodies are strengthened and healed. This is not the healing by an outward miracle; on the contrary, this is the healing by the inward dispensing of life. This kind of healing does not take place suddenly. On the contrary, healing through the divine dispensing takes time. Gradually, through the Spirit&#8217;s giving life to our mortal bodies, we are healed, perhaps without being aware of it. Therefore, the believers may be healthy and strong through the gradual and continual dispensing of the divine life by working the Spirit into their whole being, even into their mortal bodies.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><p>We have seen that for the divine dispensing the Spirit works in the believers by enlightening them, sanctifying them, regenerating them, giving them life, saving them by renewing them, freeing them by His law of life from the law of sin and death, and giving life even to their mortal bodies. In this message we shall cover more aspects of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers.<h2 class=head2>8. Putting the Practices of Their Body to Death</h2><p>Romans 8:11 says that the Spirit gives life to our mortal bodies. As the Spirit dispenses the divine element into our mortal bodies, He puts to death the practices of the body. Romans 8:13 says, &#8220;If you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.&#8221; The Holy Spirit is working in us to put to death the practices of the body so that we may live. But if we live according to flesh, we are about to die. Of course, this kind of dying is spiritual, not physical. If we live according to flesh, we are about to die in our spirit. However, if by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body-that is, mortify or crucify them-we shall live in spirit.<p>Paul&#8217;s word in Romans 8:13 corresponds to verse 6, which says that the mind set on the flesh is death and the mind set on the spirit is life. To live according to flesh primarily means to set our mind on the flesh. In order to put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we need to set our mind on the spirit and walk according to spirit. When we have our mind set on our spirit, we cooperate with the Spirit&#8217;s work to put to death all the practices of the body; thus, we experience the death of Christ. The genuine experience of the co-crucifixion with Christ is in our putting to death by the Spirit the practices of the body. This does not happen once for all; rather, it is a constant, daily exercise. Every practice of the body must be put to death by our setting our mind on the spirit.<p>If we walk according to spirit and set our mind on the spirit, spontaneously we shall by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body. Then we shall be absolutely under the divine dispensing, and we shall participate in this rich dispensing and enjoy it. Furthermore, if we put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we shall automatically be in the Body of Christ in a practical way. If we do not by the Spirit put to death the practices of the body, our body cannot be presented to the Lord for the Body life (Rom. 12:1). In order to have our body presented to God for the Body of Christ, we need to put to death by the Spirit the practices of the body.<h2 class=head2>9. Supplying Them with His Bountiful Supply</h2><p>The Spirit also works in the believers to supply them with His bountiful supply. In Philippians 1:19 Paul says, &#8220;I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Here in speaking of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, Paul uses a particular Greek word, choragus. The words &#8220;bountiful supply&#8221; are not simply a translation of this Greek word but an interpretation of it. Literally, this word refers to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus in ancient times by the leader or director of the chorus, who was called the choragus. Hence, this Greek word implies a bountiful supply. The choragus supplied all the needs of everyone in the chorus, the needs for food, clothing, lodging, and musical instruments. The supply of the choragus truly was bountiful, even all-inclusive. Once a person had joined the chorus, there was no need for him to be concerned about the necessities of life; the choragus would supply whatever he needed. In using the expression &#8220;the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,&#8221; Paul likens the supply of the Spirit to that of the choragus. Therefore, to have a proper understanding of 1:19, we need the word &#8220;bountiful&#8221; with the word &#8220;supply.&#8221; This bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit is for us to live Christ and magnify Him. The supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is bountiful and all-inclusive. What we have today is not a partial supply but a bountiful, all-inclusive supply.<p>If the Triune God is to be our experience and enjoyment, He must be the Spirit with the bountiful supply. The Spirit in Philippians 1:19 is actually the Triune God who has passed through a divine process to become available to us as our bountiful supply. Now simply by calling &#8220;O Lord Jesus&#8221; we can experience the Spirit supplying us. When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we drink of the Spirit and receive His bountiful supply. Because the Spirit with His supply is subjective to us, He is with us wherever we may be. Simply by calling on the name of Jesus we receive the Spirit, enjoy the Spirit, and experience the Spirit. By calling on the Lord&#8217;s name or by praying over even a few words in the Bible, we enjoy the Spirit with His bountiful supply.<p>Although the Spirit is working to supply us with His bountiful supply, we need to cooperate with Him. Just as we need to breathe in the air supplied to us by God, we need to receive and enjoy the supply of the Spirit, by praying, calling on the Lord, and spending time daily in the Word. Everything we need is in the Spirit with His bountiful supply. Now we should cooperate with the Spirit. This is the reason Paul goes on in Philippians 2:12 and 13 to speak of our obedience to the inward operation of the Triune God. The Spirit&#8217;s working requires our cooperation, our obedience.<p>It is significant that in Philippians 1:19 Paul speaks first of the saints&#8217; petition, then of the bountiful supply of the Spirit. The reason Paul speaks this way is to indicate that the bountiful supply of the compound Spirit is upon the Body of Christ. Paul realized that he was simply a member of this Body. As a member, he needed the supply of the Body. If the Body would be exercised to supply him, the bountiful supply of the Spirit would come to him through the Body.<p>According to the type in Exodus 30, the compound ointment was used to anoint the tabernacle, God&#8217;s dwelling place, as well as all furnishings and utensils used in the service of the tabernacle. Furthermore, the priests were anointed with this compound ointment. This signifies that the supply of the compound Spirit is for the Body of Christ, the church, God&#8217;s house, and also for God&#8217;s service. If we are not in the Body or if we do not care for God&#8217;s service, it will be very difficult for us to partake of the supply of the Spirit. To enjoy the Spirit we need to be part of the tabernacle and of the priesthood, part of God&#8217;s dwelling and of His service. Then spontaneously we shall be anointed with the compound Spirit and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head2>10. Leading Them to Live a Life as Sons of God</h2><p>The Spirit also works in the believers by leading them to live a life as sons of God. &#8220;As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God&#8221; (Rom. 8:14). We know that we are sons of God because we are led by the Spirit. This leading is not accidental nor occasional. Rather, the leading of the Spirit should be habitual, constant. Continuously in our daily living we should be led by the Spirit. If we are continually led by the Spirit, then we are living as sons of God in a practical way.<p>As sons of God, we have the Spirit&#8217;s leading. We have something that functions within us spontaneously and automatically to give us the Lord&#8217;s leading. However, we need to cooperate by paying attention to this leading and by honoring it. Sometimes we say that we do not know the Spirit&#8217;s leading, when deep within we know it quite well. We may not know it in the mind, but we know it in our spirit. Within our spirit we have the leading of the Spirit. Having the leading of the Spirit, we should honor it and obey it.<p>We may have a mistaken, natural concept regarding the leading of the Spirit. The leading of the Spirit does not derive from nor depend on outward things. On the contrary, the Spirit&#8217;s leading is an issue of the inner life; it comes from the sense of life, from the consciousness of the divine life within us. Hence, the leading of the Spirit is a matter of life, a matter of the sense and consciousness of life. The mind set on the spirit is life (Rom. 8:6). We know this life not by outward things but by the inward sense and consciousness of life. There is an inner sense that comes from setting the mind on the spirit. If our mind is set on the spirit, we are immediately strengthened and satisfied inwardly. We are also watered and refreshed. By this sense and consciousness we know the life within us, and by this sense of life we can know that we are under the leading of the Spirit. Therefore, the leading of the Spirit does not depend on outward things; it depends absolutely on the sense of life within our spirit. The divine life leads us constantly, not by signs or indicators but by giving us an inner sense or consciousness. Those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. If we are led by outward things, this does not prove that we are sons of God. However, if we are led by the inner sense of the divine life, this indicates that we are sons of God. Because we have the life of God, we have the leading that issues from this life, the leading which indicates that we are sons of God.<p>The leading of the Spirit which Paul speaks of in Romans 8:14 comes as we walk according to the spirit (v. 4) and set our mind on the spirit. If we walk according to the spirit and set our mind on the spirit, we shall have the leading of the Spirit. We shall have the sense that we are walking, behaving, and living according to the spirit. We should not violate this inner sense or disobey it, for it is truly the leading of the Spirit. When we have this sense within, it indicates that we are being led by the Spirit. Hence, to set our mind on the spirit is to be placed under the leading of the Spirit. The inner life gives us a sense, even in small matters, of whether or not we are under the Spirit&#8217;s leading. The leading of the Spirit, therefore, is not derived from the outward environment but from the inner sense and consciousness of the divine life in our spirit. This leading proves that we are sons of God.<p>The leading of the Spirit by the inner sense of the divine life does not happen as an accident. Like breathing, it is a continual matter in our daily life. Normal breathing is continuous. Because the leading of the Spirit is a matter of life, it should continue normally in every aspect of our daily walk.<p>The Spirit works in us to lead us to live a life as sons of God. If we do not live and walk according to the leading of the Spirit, we may be the children of God concerning which the Spirit witnesses with our spirit (Rom. 8:16), but we do not have the mark that designates us as the sons of God. We may be God&#8217;s children, but we do not have the growth that comes by living and walking according to the leading of the Spirit in life. The leading of the Spirit marks us out as being sons of God in the growth of life.<p>There is an important difference between the children of God in Romans 8:16 and the sons of God in verse 14. The children of God are in the initial stage of the divine life, the stage that mainly concerns birth, whereas the sons of God are in a more advanced stage, the stage that concerns growth in life. In order to be children of God we need the witnessing of the Spirit with our spirit. But in order to be sons of God we need the leading of the Spirit by the sense of the divine life. As long as we have the witness of the Spirit with our spirit, we have the assurance that we are children of God. However, in order to have the proof, the mark, that we are sons of God we need to have the leading of the Spirit and to live and walk according to the inner sense of the divine life. All real Christians are children of God, having the witness of the Spirit with their spirit, but not all have the mark that they are sons of God growing in the divine life and living and walking according to the leading of the Spirit. Therefore, we all need to go on in the growth in life from the initial stage of being children of God to the more advanced stage, showing that we are sons of God by bearing the distinct mark of the leading of the Spirit in life.<h2 class=head2>11. Washing, Sanctifying, and Justifying Them</h2><p>Through the various aspects of the Spirit&#8217;s work which we have covered thus far, the believers are washed, sanctified, and justified. First Corinthians 6:11 says, &#8220;These things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.&#8221; This washing, sanctifying, and justifying are inward and in life. Inwardly the Spirit works to wash, sanctify, and justify the believers in life. First, we are washed from sinful things; second, we are sanctified, separated, unto God; and third, we are justified, accepted, by God.<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:11 the washing, sanctifying, and justifying are not by the blood in an objective way, as in 1 John 1:7; Hebrews 10:29; and Romans 3:24-25. Here we have the subjective washing, sanctifying, and justifying in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit. All these aspects of God&#8217;s salvation are accomplished in us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, in the person of the Lord, in organic union with the Lord through faith, and in the Spirit of God, that is, in the power and realization of the Holy Spirit. The name of the Lord Jesus is the person, and the person is the Spirit. We cannot separate the name of the Lord from the Spirit, for the Spirit is His person. According to chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of the Gospel of John, the name cannot be separated from the Spirit. The reason for this is that the name is the person, and the person is the Spirit. When we call, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8221; the Lord comes. But when He comes to us, He is the Spirit. Paul experienced this. He knew that when he called on the Lord&#8217;s name, the Lord came to him as the Spirit. In the name and in the Spirit he experienced the subjective washing, sanctifying, and justifying. This also is our experience. When we call on the name of the Lord, the person comes, and this person is the Spirit. If we continue to call on the name of the Lord, enjoying His name and His Spirit, we shall be continually washed, sanctified, and justified by the Spirit.<p>The work of the Spirit in washing, sanctifying, and justifying us is actually the dispensing of the Spirit into us. The Spirit dispenses His element into us, and this dispensing of the Spirit is the washing, sanctifying, and justifying work of the Spirit. Therefore, this work of the Spirit is simply to dispense His element and essence into our being in a very subjective way.<h2 class=head2>12. Sanctifying Them</h2><p>The Spirit works in the believers to sanctify them, to separate them entirely for God&#8217;s eternal purpose. Romans 15:16 speaks of the Gentile believers being &#8220;sanctified in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This is not objective, positional sanctification; it is subjective, dispositional sanctification. God has given His Holy Spirit to us to sanctify us, to separate us unto God for His purpose. Thus, the Holy Spirit is moving, working, and acting within us constantly to sanctify us.<p>Second Thessalonians 2:13 says, &#8220;God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit.&#8221; God has chosen us unto salvation in sanctification, and this sanctification is of the Spirit. God&#8217;s salvation is in sanctification. This means that God&#8217;s salvation involves a continuing process through which we are being made holy. As this process is taking place, we enjoy God&#8217;s saving power.<p>For us to be in sanctification means that we are in the process of being made holy. Day by day we are being sanctified. The One who sanctifies us is the Spirit. This is the reason the Bible speaks of the sanctification of the Spirit. All day long the Spirit is sanctifying us, applying to us what the Father has planned and what the Son has accomplished. We have such a practical, living, and subjective Sanctifier.<p>As far as sanctification is concerned 2 Thessalonians 2:13 is all-inclusive. Paul says here that God&#8217;s salvation is in the sanctification of the Spirit. This means that the part played in salvation by the Father and the Son are in the sanctification of the Spirit. Therefore, without the sanctification of the Spirit, there would be no way to apply what the Father and the Son have done for us. What the Father and the Son have done for us is applied to us by the Spirit. Paul refers to this application as sanctification of the Spirit. The salvation of the Triune God, therefore, is carried out in the sanctification of the Spirit.<p>Sanctification separates us unto God by putting a mark on us. This mark is actually the Triune God Himself. Whenever we are sanctified, we are marked with the Triune God. As a result, others can see the Triune God in us. Furthermore, this mark is increasing and becoming more intensified. Year after year, this mark is being wrought into us. This is the work of the Spirit in sanctification. By the sanctifying work of the Spirit we are being saved. Furthermore, in this way we live a holy life for the church life.<p>In 2 Thessalonians 2:13 and 14 we see that salvation in sanctification of the Spirit is unto the obtaining of the glory of Christ to express God. Sanctification of the Spirit is the divine transformation. By this we are thoroughly saved from all old and negative things and made a new creation to obtain the Lord&#8217;s glory.<p>First Peter 1:2 speaks of &#8220;the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.&#8221; Sanctification of the Spirit here is not the sanctification which is after justification through the redemption of Christ, as revealed in Romans 6:19, 22; 15:16. Here sanctification of the Spirit is before the obedience of faith in Christ&#8217;s redemption, that is, before justification through Christ&#8217;s redemption (1 Cor. 6:11), indicating that the believers&#8217; obedience unto faith in Christ results from the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying work.<p>Concerning the sanctification of the Spirit, there are two aspects. The first aspect of this sanctification precedes justification and carries out God&#8217;s choice, His selection, and brings the chosen ones to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood for their justification. Thus, this aspect of the Spirit&#8217;s initial sanctification is before justification through the redemption of Christ. Then, following justification, the Spirit continues to work to sanctify us dispositionally. The sequence is this: God&#8217;s selection, the Spirit&#8217;s sanctification, justification, and then subjective sanctification. Before we can have subjective sanctification of the Spirit, we must have the first aspect of the Spirit&#8217;s sanctification, the sanctifying work that takes place before God&#8217;s justification.<p>In eternity past God, according to His foreknowledge, chose us. He selected us and made a decision to gain us. Then in time the Spirit came to us to sanctify us, to set us apart from the world, so that we would obey Christ&#8217;s redemption. The Spirit came to separate us for the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ. When we obey, the blood sprinkles us. It is the sanctifying Spirit who separates us from the world unto the obedience of Christ&#8217;s blood. First we repent and believe, and then we obey what Christ has done on the cross. Following this, we receive the sprinkling of the blood of Christ. This is the sanctifying work of the Spirit following God&#8217;s selection to carry out God&#8217;s choice and to bring us to Christ&#8217;s redemption.<p>The sanctifying work of the Spirit began before God&#8217;s justification and continues afterward. Before justification, we were separated unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Christ. After justification we are sanctified continually, subjectively, dispositionally. In 1 Peter 1:2 we have the first, initial aspect; in Romans 6:19 and 22, the second, continual aspect; and in 2 Thessalonians 2:13, the all-inclusive sanctification of the Spirit. The goal of this sanctification is to carry out God&#8217;s full salvation.<p>The New Testament indicates that the sanctifying work of the Holy Spirit began even before our repentance. Actually, without the Spirit&#8217;s work in sanctification, no sinners would repent. This is portrayed by the three parables in Luke 15. In the second parable the woman, signifying the Holy Spirit, enlightens the house to seek the lost coin. In the third parable the prodigal son eventually comes to himself, that is, wakes up, and decides to return to his father. The waking up of the prodigal son in the third parable is the result of the searching of the woman in the second parable. This indicates that apart from the Spirit&#8217;s searching and enlightening us, we would never wake up and repent. This is the reason that in 1 Peter 1:2 the sanctification of the Spirit comes before the sprinkling of the blood of Christ. Without the searching of the Spirit in His sanctifying work, we could not repent and return to God. Therefore, even before we believed and repented, the Spirit did His sanctifying work to separate us to God and to bring us to repentance.<p>We were chosen by God the Father in eternity past. This was done according to the Father&#8217;s foreknowledge, and it is carried out in time in the initial sanctification of the Spirit. All believers were chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, and unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. The divine foreknowledge was exercised, and the sanctification of the Spirit followed unto the obedience of faith in Christ. Our believing in Christ, therefore, results from the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying work. We were sanctified, separated, by the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. This means that the result of the Spirit&#8217;s sanctification is our participating in the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. Sanctification brought us to the sprinkling of the blood shed by the Savior on the cross and separated us unto this divine provision. Now we are redeemed ones. We were chosen by God the Father, sanctified by the Spirit, and sprinkled by the blood of Jesus Christ.<p>The sanctifying work of the Spirit is also a matter of the divine dispensing. When we heard the gospel, the Spirit began to sanctify us by dispensing the Triune God into our being. Through this dispensing we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus. From that time onward, the Spirit has been separating us and saturating us by dispensing the Triune God into us.<p>As the Spirit sanctifies us, He imparts God&#8217;s life into us. When we were saved and regenerated, we received God&#8217;s life. However, this does not mean that we received God&#8217;s life in a total sense. Although we have received God&#8217;s life, we still need more impartation of God&#8217;s life into us each day. This is a gradual process that goes on during our entire life. No matter how experienced we may be in the spiritual life, this process of life imparting must still go on within us. As the Spirit carries out His sanctifying work, He imparts more of God&#8217;s life into us. This imparting of life always accompanies the sanctifying work of the Spirit. Without His work of sanctification, He could not impart God&#8217;s life into us. Life imparting is always included within the Spirit&#8217;s sanctifying work. The extent to which the impartation of life will proceed depends on the degree He is able to sanctify us. The impartation of life is always the issue of sanctification. Thus, life imparting and sanctifying work together. As the Spirit sanctifies us, He gives us life.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE EIGHTY-NINE</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(4)</h1><p>We need to be impressed with the fact that the work of the Spirit in the believers subjectively is for the divine dispensing. This means that the work of the Holy Spirit in us is for the purpose of dispensing the Triune God into us. Whatever the Spirit does in us is for the dispensing into our being of the Triune God in His life, nature, element, and essence. This is the glad tidings of the divine dispensing. The Triune God, by being consummated into the life-giving Spirit, is dispensing Himself into us. Now this life-giving Spirit is working in many aspects to carry out this dispensing.<p>In the two previous messages we have covered twelve aspects of the work of the Spirit in the believers for the divine dispensing. These twelve aspects, which begin with enlightening, sanctification, and regeneration, and end with sanctification, are one complete stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work. Now we shall begin to consider another stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in us-the inner-life-working stage. The first aspect of this stage is the work of the Spirit in transforming the believers.<h2 class=head2>13. Transforming Them</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; As we behold and reflect the glory of the Lord, He infuses us with the elements of what He is and what He has done. He dispenses these elements into us. The result is that we are being transformed metabolically to have His life shape by His life power with His life essence. We are then transfigured, mainly by the renewing of our mind (Rom. 12:2), into His image. The words &#8220;being transformed&#8221; indicate that we are in the process of transformation. The &#8220;same image&#8221; is the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ. We are being conformed to the image of the resurrected and glorified Christ (Rom. 8:29); we are being made the same as He is.<p>Paul tells us that we are being transformed into the same image &#8220;from glory to glory.&#8221; This means that we are being transformed from one degree of glory to another degree. This denotes an ongoing process of life in resurrection.<p>To be transformed is to have Christ added into our being to replace what we are so that Christ may increase and our natural life may decrease. As the process of transformation takes place within us, the old element of our natural being is carried away, and the glory, the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit, is added into us to replace the natural element. As a result, today is different from yesterday, and tomorrow will be different from today, for each day we have less of the natural element and more of Christ.<p>It is important to know the difference between change and transformation. Transformation involves the process of metabolism. However, something may change in an outward way without any inward metabolic transformation. In the process of metabolism a new element is supplied to an organism. This new element replaces the old element and causes it to be discharged. Therefore, as the process of metabolism takes place within a living organism, something new is created within it to replace the old element, which is carried away. Metabolism, therefore, includes three matters: first, the supplying of a new element; second, the replacing of the old element with this new element; and third, the discharge or the removal of the old element so that something new may be produced.<p>I wish to emphasize the fact that transformation is a metabolic process, a metabolic change. The Spirit&#8217;s work in transforming us involves a change in our whole being-in life, nature, essence, element, form, and appearance. Transformation is not outward change, correction, or adjustment; transformation is altogether an inward, metabolic change of our being. Therefore, we may define transformation as a divine, spiritual metabolism wherein a new element is added to the old to discharge the old and to produce something new.<p>In order for the Spirit to do His transforming work in us, there is the need for a certain essence to be dispensed into us by the Spirit. Therefore, the Holy Spirit is working in us to transform us in life, nature, essence, element, form, appearance, and every aspect of our being by the dispensing into us of the divine life, nature, element, and essence. This means that the divine life, nature, essence, element, and being are dispensed by the Spirit into our life, nature, essence, element, and being to cause a metabolic change within us. This change is organic, for it is a change in our being by another being, in our life by another life, in our nature by another nature, and in our element and essence by another element and essence. This transformation is by the Lord Spirit. As the Spirit works to transform us by the divine dispensing, He causes a metabolic, organic change to take place in our whole being.<p>Transformation is related to the Spirit&#8217;s work in sanctification. But in nature and function there is a difference between sanctification and transformation. The nature and function of sanctification are to separate us unto God for His use. The purpose of sanctification is to separate us from being common unto God for His purpose that we may fulfill His plan. However, although sanctification involves separation unto God for His purpose, there is still the need for a metabolic change in our being. This comes from transformation.<p>Transformation is the changing aspect of sanctification, and sanctification is the separating aspect of transformation. Before we were saved, we were in a fallen condition among sinners, and we were buried in worldly things. One day the Holy Spirit came to find us and separate us unto God for His use to fulfill His purpose. However, our life, nature, element, and essence, and even our whole being, remained in the old creation. For this reason, when the Spirit separated us unto God, He also dispensed the divine life, nature, essence, and element-even the divine being-into us so that we may be transformed into the image, the expression, of the Triune God. We may say that this transformation is an aspect of sanctification. Now we have not only been separated unto God, but we are also being transformed into Christ&#8217;s image by the dispensing of God&#8217;s essence, element, life, and nature into us. Therefore, sanctification and transformation go together: transformation depends on sanctification, and sanctification works for transformation.<h2 class=head2>14. Indwelling Them</h2><p>In Romans 8:9 and 11 Paul speaks of the Spirit indwelling the believers. It is a great matter to have the Spirit indwelling us. Verse 9 speaks of the Spirit of God dwelling in us. Verse 11 goes on to say, &#8220;If the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.&#8221; As the Spirit indwells us, He is not idle. Rather, He is active to impart life to us. The indwelling Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life. According to Romans 8, the Spirit gives life to our spirit (v. 10), our soul, represented by the mind (v. 6), and our body (v. 11). This indwelling Spirit is thus imparting the divine life into our tripartite being. The purpose of the Spirit&#8217;s indwelling is to dispense life, which is actually God Himself, into the three parts of our being. This dispensing begins from our spirit, the center of our being, and then spreads into our soul and body until our entire being is saturated with the divine essence for our transformation.<p>Two verses in 1 Corinthians speak of the Spirit indwelling the believers. In 3:16 Paul asks, &#8220;Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and the Spirit of God dwells in you?&#8221; Then in 6:19 he asks, &#8220;Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?&#8221; In these verses we have two kinds of temples-the corporate temple, the church, and individual temples, which are the believers&#8217; physical bodies. In 3:16 the believers are a corporate temple; in 6:19 a believer&#8217;s body is an individual temple. The Holy Spirit is in our spirit (Rom. 8:16), and our spirit is within our body. Hence, our body becomes a temple, a dwelling place, of the Holy Spirit. Both kinds of temples are for the Spirit&#8217;s indwelling so that He may dispense the Triune God into us individually and corporately.<p>Second Timothy 1:14 says, &#8220;Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.&#8221; The indwelling Spirit is working to enable us to guard the deposit. According to 1 and 2 Timothy, this deposit consists of healthy teachings concerning God&#8217;s economy, God&#8217;s plan to dispense Himself into us. Timothy had received these teachings as a deposit, and Paul charged him to guard this deposit through the indwelling Holy Spirit. By guarding the deposit in this way, Timothy would not be distracted from the healthy teachings concerning the eternal economy of God to dispense Himself into His redeemed people. Today we also need to guard the good deposit through the indwelling Spirit. Since the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, to guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires us to exercise our spirit.<p>Finally, James 4:5 says, &#8220;Do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit who dwells in us longs to envy?&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;dwells&#8221; may also be translated &#8220;makes His home.&#8221; The indwelling Spirit makes His home in us so that He may occupy our entire being for God (cf. Eph. 3:17) and cause us to be wholly for our Husband. When God secured us to be His spouse, He put His Spirit into us to make us one with Him (1 Cor. 6:19, 16-17). He is a jealous God (Exo. 20:5), and His Spirit is jealous over us with the jealousy of God (2 Cor. 11:2), longing, jealously desiring, that we may not be friends with His enemy and be His lover at the same time.<p>Only in 4:5 does James mention God&#8217;s indwelling Spirit. His one mention of the Spirit is negative, concerning the abolishing of the friendship of the world. It is not positive, concerning the building up of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>15. As the Means for Them to Know That God Abides in Them and They in God</h2><p>The Spirit also works in the believers as the means for them to know that God abides in them and they in God (1 John 3:24b; 4:13). How do we know that God abides in us and that we abide in God? We know this by the indwelling Spirit. If we did not have the indwelling Spirit, we could not realize that God abides in us and we in Him. But as believers we know this mutual abiding by our experience. We have experienced that between us and God there is an organic union, an organic relationship, and that the indwelling Spirit is the link between God and us. The Spirit links us with God and God with us. Through the indwelling Spirit God abides in us and we abide in God.<p>First John 3:24b says, &#8220;In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us.&#8221; Literally, the Greek word for &#8220;by&#8221; means &#8220;out of.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;by the Spirit&#8221; modifies &#8220;we know.&#8221; Therefore, by the Spirit we know that God abides in us.<p>The first explicit mention of the Spirit in 1 John is in 3:24b. Earlier, the Spirit is anonymously implied in the anointing in 2:20 and 27. Actually, the Spirit, that is, the all-inclusive compound life-giving Spirit, is the vital and crucial factor of all the mysteries unveiled in this Epistle: the divine life, the fellowship of the divine life, the divine anointing, the abiding in the Lord, the divine birth, and the divine seed. It is by this Spirit we are born of God, we receive the divine life as the divine seed in us, we have the fellowship of the divine life, we are anointed with the Triune God, and we abide in the Lord. This wonderful Spirit is given to us as the promised blessing of the New Testament (Gal. 3:14). He is given without measure by the Christ who is above all, who inherits all, and who is to be increased universally (John 3:31-35). This Spirit and the eternal life (1 John 3:15) are the basic elements by which we live the life that abides in the Lord continually. Hence, it is by this Spirit, who witnesses assuringly with our spirit, that we are the children of God (Rom. 8:16), and that we know that the Lord of all abides in us. It is through this Spirit that we are joined to the Lord as one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17). And it is by this Spirit that we enjoy the riches of the Triune God (2 Cor. 13:14).<p>First John 3:24b does not speak of the Spirit of God or of the Holy Spirit; this verse speaks of the Spirit. Whenever the New Testament mentions the Spirit, it refers to the all-inclusive compound, life-giving, indwelling Spirit. In the last chapter of the Bible we have a word concerning the Spirit (Rev. 22:17). The Spirit is more inclusive than the Spirit of God and the Holy Spirit. The Spirit refers to the Spirit who was &#8220;not yet&#8221; (John 7:39) before Christ&#8217;s glorification. Now after the resurrection of Christ, the Spirit is here. Therefore, we abide in the Lord and He abides in us by the Spirit whom He has given to us.<p>First John 4:13 says, &#8220;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given us of His Spirit.&#8221; The words &#8220;in this&#8221; mean in the fact that God has given us of His Spirit we know that we abide in Him and He in us. The Spirit whom God has given to dwell in us is the witness in our spirit that we dwell in God and He in us. The abiding Spirit, that is, the indwelling Spirit, is the element and sphere of the mutual abiding, the mutual indwelling, of us and God. By Him we are assured that we and God are one, abiding in one another, indwelling each other mutually.<p>In 4:13 John indicates that we may know that we abide in God. To abide in God is to dwell in Him, remaining in our fellowship with Him, that we may experience and enjoy His abiding in us. This is to practice our oneness with God according to the divine anointing (2:27) by a living that practices His righteousness and love. This is all by the operation of the all-inclusive compound Spirit, who dwells in our spirit and who is the basic element of the divine anointing.<p>In 4:13 John tells us that God &#8220;has given us of His Spirit.&#8221; In Greek &#8220;of&#8221; literally means &#8220;out of.&#8221; God has given us out of His Spirit. This closely resembles and repeats the word in 3:24, which proves that this does not mean that God has given us something, such as the various gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:4, of His Spirit, but that His Spirit Himself is the all-inclusive gift (Acts 2:38). &#8220;Out of His Spirit&#8221; is an expression which implies that the Spirit of God, whom He has given to us, is bountiful and without measure (Phil. 1:19; John 3:34). By such a bountiful immeasurable Spirit we know with full assurance that we are one with God and that we abide in Him and He in us.<h2 class=head2>16. Filling Them Inwardly</h2><p>A number of verses in Acts reveal that the Spirit fills the believers inwardly. Acts 13:52 says, &#8220;The disciples were made full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;made full&#8221; is pleroo, which means to be filled inwardly. According to its usage in Acts, pleroo denotes to fill a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly in 2:2. In 13:52 the disciples were filled inwardly and essentially with the Spirit for their Christian living. This infilling is of the Holy Spirit essentially for life, not economically for power. Joy, being a matter of life, not of power, proves this.<p>Acts 6:3 says, &#8220;Select seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this need.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;full&#8221; here is pleres, an adjective form of pleroo. &#8220;Full of the Spirit&#8221; is one&#8217;s condition after being filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially, as mentioned in 13:52. This refers to life, not to work. The word &#8220;wisdom&#8221; in 6:3 also indicates that in this verse to be full of the Spirit is for life, as in Luke 2:52.<p>Acts 6:5 tells us that Stephen was &#8220;a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Acts 7:55 says of Stephen, &#8220;Being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.&#8221; These verses also refer to the inward filling of the Spirit. As Stephen was about to be martyred, he was filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially.<p>Acts 11:24 describes Barnabas as a man &#8220;full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.&#8221; As in the other verses from Acts we have considered, this refers to a believer&#8217;s condition after being filled with the Spirit essentially. This inward filling of the Spirit is not for work or for ministry but for our daily living. For this reason, the inward filling of the Spirit is essential, not economical. The Spirit works in the believers for the divine dispensing by filling them inwardly.<h2 class=head2>17. Teaching Them</h2><p>Luke 12:12 speaks of the Spirit&#8217;s work in teaching the believers: &#8220;The Holy Spirit will teach you in the same hour what should be said.&#8221; In particular, the Spirit&#8217;s teaching of the believers here refers to His teaching them what to say during persecution. When the believers are persecuted, the Spirit within them teaches them how to answer their persecutors.<h2 class=head2>18. Speaking in Them</h2><p>In Matthew 10:16-33 the Lord Jesus instructs the apostles concerning persecution and the way to meet it. He tells them not to be anxious about how or what to speak (v. 19). Then in verse 20 He goes on to say, &#8220;You are not the ones speaking, but the Spirit of your Father is the One speaking in you.&#8221; Here we see the work of the Spirit in His speaking in the believers. The Lord&#8217;s word in verse 20 corresponds to that in Luke 12:12, where He says that the Spirit will teach us what to say. When we are under persecution, the Spirit will teach us and speak in us. His speaking is His teaching.<p>As long as we have the Spirit, we have the presence of the Lord. The presence of the Lord in Matthew 10:20 is the Spirit for speaking. In facing persecution we should turn to our spirit and trust the indwelling Spirit, believing that the Spirit is with us and that He will deal with the opposers and persecutors. We should face opposition and confront attack not in ourselves, but by turning to our spirit where the Spirit of God dwells. We need to trust in Him, let Him lead us, and let Him do the speaking.<h2 class=head2>19. Guiding Them into All the Reality</h2><p>In John 16:13 we have the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers to guide them into all the reality: &#8220;When He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.&#8221; The Spirit of reality guides the believers into all the reality of the Triune God and of all divine matters. The Spirit of reality guides us into the reality of justification, holiness, love, and all other divine things. He leads us into, brings us into, the reality of these things.<p>According to the context, &#8220;the reality&#8221; in John 16:13 refers to what the Father has, what the Son has, and what the Spirit receives of the Son and of what the Father has. What the Father has is a reality, what the Son has is a reality, and what the Spirit receives is also reality. What the Father has becomes the Son&#8217;s, what the Son has is received by the Spirit, and what the Spirit receives is disclosed to us. The Father, the Son, the Spirit, and we, the believers, are all involved in this process.<p>The Father, who is the source, the origin, has many riches. All that the Father has becomes the Son&#8217;s. The Son has unsearchable riches (Eph. 3:8). Whatever the Father has is the Son&#8217;s, and what the Son has is received by the Spirit. Since what the Spirit receives is disclosed or transmitted to us, we become the destination. The Father is embodied in the Son, the Son is transfigured to be the Spirit, and the Spirit is the reaching of the divine Trinity to us. All the riches of the Triune God reach us in the Spirit. Therefore, we are the destination of the Triune God. All that the Triune God is and has has been disclosed, conveyed, transmitted, to us. Because we are organically united to the Spirit, that is, organically united to the processed Triune God, whatever He is and has now is our portion as our reality.<p>The reality into which the Spirit guides us is the reality of the divine Trinity. Actually, the reality of the divine Trinity is the indwelling Spirit. It is the Spirit who dwells within us, not the Spirit who rests upon us, who is this reality. The Spirit is the reality of all that the Father and the Son are. Without the Spirit, there is the essence of what the Father and the Son are, but there is no realization. The Spirit is the application of all that the Father and the Son are. If we would apply all that the Father and the Son are, we need the Spirit. Now the indwelling Spirit is guiding the believers not into the doctrine of the Triune God but into the reality of the Triune God.<p>Through the Spirit the reality of the divine Trinity is transmitted into us. Through this transmission all the riches of what the processed Triune God is and has are dispensed into us. Now whatever the processed Triune God is and has becomes our element. This makes the processed Triune God the very essence of our being. In this way the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God becomes our portion. This is the Spirit as the reality of the Triune God for our experience and enjoyment.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(5)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the second stage-the inner-life-working stage-of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers for the divine dispensing.<h2 class=head2>20. Searching and Revealing to Them All Things concerning Christ-the Depths of God</h2><p>As the Spirit works in the believers, He searches and reveals to them all things concerning Christ-the depths of God. First Corinthians 2:10 says, &#8220;God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.&#8221; The depths of God refer to the deep things of God, which are Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion, foreordained, prepared, and given to us freely by God. These have never arisen in man&#8217;s heart, but they are revealed to us in our spirit by God&#8217;s Spirit. Hence, we must be spiritual in order to partake of them. We need to live and move in our spirit that we may enjoy Christ as everything to us.<p>God reveals the deep and hidden things to us through the Spirit, for these things have not been seen by man&#8217;s eyes, heard by man&#8217;s ears, nor have they come up in man&#8217;s heart (1 Cor. 2:9). This means that man has no idea concerning them, no thought of them. They are altogether mysterious, hidden in God, and beyond human understanding. But God has revealed them to us through the Spirit, who searches all things, even the depths of God.<p>To have something revealed to us is different from being taught about that thing. To teach is related to our mind; to reveal, to our spirit. To realize the deep and hidden things God has prepared for us, our spirit is more necessary than our mind. When our entire being becomes one with God through loving Him in intimate fellowship, He shows us, in our spirit through His Spirit, all the secrets of Christ as our portion. This is to reveal the hidden things planned by His wisdom concerning Christ, things which have never come up in man&#8217;s heart.<p>First Corinthians 2:10 says that the Spirit searches all things. The life-giving Spirit is searching Christ as the depths of God. The Greek word rendered &#8220;searches&#8221; includes active research and implies accurate knowledge not in discovering but in exploring. The Spirit of God explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows them to us in our spirit for our realization and participation. The life-giving Spirit is moving and searching within us. By this searching He imparts the riches of Christ into our being.<p>To know the depths of God is to know Christ in many aspects as our eternal portion. Christ is the center of God&#8217;s economy, the portion given to us by God for enjoyment, and the mysterious wisdom hidden in God. God&#8217;s wisdom in a mystery is Christ as the deep things of God. Christ, the all-inclusive and extensive One, is truly the depths of God.<p>If we would know Christ as the depths of God, we need to know that through incarnation God became a man named Jesus. Through His crucifixion the Lord Jesus terminated the old creation and released the divine life that it may be imparted into all who believe in Him. Now, in resurrection, He is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit and who has become one spirit with us. We have a mingled spirit within us, our regenerated human spirit mingled with the divine Spirit. Now we are one spirit with the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). These matters are unfathomable; they are immeasurably deep and profound.<p>If we consider the context of the whole book of 1 Corinthians, we shall have the assurance to interpret the deep things of God in 2:10 as referring to the all-inclusive Christ who, as the life-giving Spirit, indwells our spirit. After accomplishing redemption, this Christ has become the life-giving Spirit. As such, He is so available to us that we can be joined to Him as one spirit. Nothing can be deeper than this.<h2 class=head2>21. Teaching Them Spiritual Words- the Things of the Spirit of God- for Spiritual Communication</h2><p>The Spirit teaches the believers spiritual words-the things of the Spirit of God-for spiritual communication. First Corinthians 2:13 says, &#8220;Which also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in words taught by the Spirit, communicating spiritual things by spiritual things.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;communicating&#8221; literally means mixing or putting together, as interpreting or expounding. It is common in the Septuagint, found in verses such as Genesis 40:8; 41:12, 15. The thought here is to speak spiritual things by spiritual words. The stress is not on the person to whom the speaking is done but on the means by which the spiritual things are spoken. Paul spoke the spiritual things, which are the deep things of God concerning Christ, by the spiritual things, which are the spiritual words taught by the Spirit.<p>In 1 Corinthians 2:13 Paul says that he did not speak the spiritual things in words taught by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit. This means that he did not speak in the words of Greek philosophy or wisdom. Rather, he communicated spiritual things by spiritual words.<p>In 2:13 Paul uses the same term with two meanings. First, &#8220;spiritual things&#8221; refers to the spiritual things themselves, the deep things of God concerning Christ. Second, this expression refers to spiritual words. Spiritual things are designated and communicated by spiritual words. These spiritual words are spiritual things used to designate spiritual things. The speaking that is according to man&#8217;s wisdom is not spiritual. But the words taught by the Spirit of God are truly spiritual things. Thus, spiritual things are both the things given to us by God concerning Christ as our portion and also the words taught by the Spirit of God. Paul spoke spiritual things by spiritual things. He used spiritual words that are equal to the spiritual things themselves. Like Paul, we need to speak spiritual things by spiritual things. This we may do through the working of the Spirit, who teaches us spiritual words for spiritual communication.<h2 class=head2>22. Speaking with Them</h2><p>As the Spirit works in the believers, He speaks also with them (1 Cor. 7:40). This means that when we speak, the Spirit speaks with us. For this we need to be one with the Triune God. If we are truly one with the indwelling Spirit, the Spirit will speak in our speaking.<p>The matter of the Spirit&#8217;s speaking with the believers is clearly seen in 1 Corinthians 7. Paul&#8217;s teaching in this chapter is very different from that of the prophets in the Old Testament. When the prophets spoke for God in Old Testament times, the word of the Lord came to them and enabled them to speak on God&#8217;s behalf. Often the prophets would say, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord.&#8221; The New Testament way of speaking for the Lord is very different. In 1 Corinthians 7 Paul never utters the words, &#8220;Thus saith the Lord.&#8221; The reason Paul does not use such an expression is that the apostles&#8217; teaching in the New Testament is based on the principle of incarnation. According to this principle, God speaks in man&#8217;s speaking. With Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 we have an example of this principle of incarnation. Although Paul writes here that certain things he says are not the Lord&#8217;s word or commandment (v. 25), everything spoken by Paul in this chapter has nonetheless become part of the divine revelation in the New Testament. This is because Paul was a person absolutely one with God. Even when he says that he does not have a word from the Lord, the Lord speaks in his speaking. Because Paul was one with the Lord, when he spoke, the Lord spoke with him.<p>In verse 40 Paul says, &#8220;She is more blessed if she so remains, according to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&#8221; In verse 10 the apostle says, &#8220;I charge, not I but the Lord.&#8221; In verse 12 he says, &#8220;I say, not the Lord.&#8221; In verse 25 he says, &#8220;I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion.&#8221; In verse 40 he says, &#8220;According to my opinion; but I think that I also have the Spirit of God.&#8221; All these words indicate the New Testament principle of incarnation, that is, God and man, man and God, becoming one. This differs drastically from the principle of Old Testament prophecy-speaking for God. In the Old Testament the word of Jehovah came to a prophet (Jer. 1:2; Ezek. 1:3), the prophet being simply the mouthpiece of God. But in the New Testament the Lord becomes one with His apostles and they become one with Him. Both speak together. His word becomes their word, and whatever they utter is His word. Hence, the apostle&#8217;s charge is the Lord&#8217;s charge (v. 10). What he says, though not by the Lord, still becomes a part of the divine revelation in the New Testament (v. 12). He is so one with the Lord that even when he gives his own opinion, not the commandment of the Lord (v. 25), he still thinks that he also has the Spirit of God. He does not claim definitely to have the Spirit of God, but he thinks that he also has the Spirit of God. This is the highest spirituality, a spirituality based on the principle of incarnation.<h2 class=head2>23. Comforting Them</h2><p>Another aspect of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers is His comforting them. Acts 9:31 says, &#8220;The church throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being built up; and going on in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it was multiplied.&#8221; This indicates that the church was suffering affliction through the persecutions, in which she feared the Lord and enjoyed the comfort of the Holy Spirit.<p>The Spirit&#8217;s work in comforting us is a matter of the divine dispensing. We are comforted by the Spirit, and encouraged by Him, through His dispensing. The Triune God is dispensing Himself into us, and this dispensing is the Spirit&#8217;s comforting. Genuine comfort, therefore, involves the divine dispensing, the dispensing of the riches of the Triune God into our being.<h2 class=head2>24. Giving Them Joy</h2><p>The indwelling Spirit gives joy to the believers. Romans 14:17 says, &#8220;The kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; First Thessalonians 1:6 tells us that the believers &#8220;accepted the word in much affliction with joy of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Because the Holy Spirit is a Spirit of joy, daily we should be joyful in the Lord.<h2 class=head2>25. Empowering Them to Abound in Hope in God</h2><p>Romans 15:13 says, &#8220;Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here we see that the Spirit empowers the believers to abound in hope in God.<h2 class=head2>26. Giving Them Love</h2><p>The Spirit also gives love to the believers. Romans 15:30 speaks of the love of the Spirit, and Colossians 1:8 refers to the believers&#8217; love in the Spirit. In these verses the Spirit is revealed as the source, the element, and the sphere of the believers&#8217; love toward all the saints in Christ. According to our natural understanding, the matter of love is common. But according to the divine fact it is not common. Colossians 1:4 refers to the love which the saints in Colosse had unto all the saints; verse 8 reveals that their love to all the saints was the love in the Spirit. In ourselves we cannot have this kind of love. This love is in the Spirit. The Spirit is the source, the element, the very essence and sphere of such a love.<p>Our natural, human love is not universal. However, the Spirit works in us to give us a love for all the different members of the Lord&#8217;s Body. We love the brothers in the Lord from all cultures, races, and countries. This is not possible by our natural love, but there is this kind of love in the all-inclusive Spirit. He is the source, the element, and the sphere of this love. If we live in Him, He will give us the universal love that causes us to love all the saints.<h2 class=head2>27. Pouring Out God&#8217;s Love in Their Hearts</h2><p>Romans 5:5 says, &#8220;The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.&#8221; This verse reveals the work of the Spirit in pouring out God&#8217;s love in the hearts of the believers. Often in our Christian life we need encouragement and confirmation. As we pass through periods of suffering, we may have questions and doubts. Although doubts arise, we cannot deny that the love of God is within us. From the day we first called on the Lord Jesus, the love of God has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit. This means that the Spirit confirms and assures us with the love of God. The indwelling Spirit assures us that God loves us. Therefore, although we may be afflicted, we cannot deny the presence of God&#8217;s love within us. Christ died for ungodly sinners such as we. Once we were enemies, but Christ shed His blood on the cross to reconcile us to God. What love is this! Through the work of the indwelling Spirit we realize afresh that God loves us and that His love has been poured out into our hearts.<p>The best way to be filled with the Holy Spirit is first to make a thorough confession of our sins, failures, and weaknesses. Then we should ponder God&#8217;s love, considering how much He loves us. If we do this, the Holy Spirit will pour out God&#8217;s love into our hearts, and we shall be filled with the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>28. Mingling with Their Spirit in Their Faith</h2><p>Second Corinthians 4:13 indicates that the indwelling Spirit mingles with the believers in their faith: &#8220;Having the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, I believed, therefore I spoke; we also believe, therefore also we speak.&#8221; The &#8220;same spirit&#8221; refers to the same spirit as set forth in the quotation from Psalm 116:10. Concerning the spirit in 2 Corinthians 4:13, Alford says, &#8220;Not distinctly the Holy Spirit,-but still not merely a human disposition: the indwelling Holy Spirit penetrates and characterizes the whole renewed man.&#8221; Vincent says, &#8220;Spirit of faith: not distinctly the Holy Spirit, nor, on the other hand, a human faculty or disposition, but blending both.&#8221; This means it is a mingling of the Holy Spirit with our human spirit. We must exercise such a spirit to believe and to speak, as the psalmist did, the things we have experienced of the Lord, especially His death and resurrection. Faith is in our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit, not in our mind. Doubts are in our mind. The &#8220;spirit&#8221; here indicates that it is by the mingled spirit that the apostles lived a crucified life in resurrection for carrying out their ministry.<p>If we would have the boldness to speak concerning Christ and of our experience of Christ in His death and resurrection, we need the spirit of faith. This means that in order to testify of what we have experienced of Christ, we need such a mingled spirit. As long as we have this mingled spirit, we shall have faith. Then we shall have the boldness to speak to others about our experience of Christ in His death and resurrection. As those who love the Lord Jesus, we need to practice being one spirit with Him. If we do this, we shall have the spirit of faith, for the indwelling Spirit will be mingled with our spirit in our faith.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(6)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers in the inner-life-working stage.<h2 class=head2>29. As the Means for God the Father to Strengthen Them into Their Inner Man That Christ May Make His Home in Their Hearts</h2><p>The indwelling Spirit is the means for God the Father to strengthen the believers into the inner man that Christ may make His home in their hearts. In Ephesians 3:16 and 17 Paul prayed that the Father would &#8220;grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith.&#8221; Because the Father does not do anything directly, He does not strengthen us directly. It is through the Spirit that the Father strengthens us. Actually, we are strengthened by the Father as the Spirit, for the Spirit is the Father working within us. When the Father works in us, He works through the Spirit, and the Spirit&#8217;s working in us is the Father&#8217;s working. By the Spirit the Father is continually strengthening us into the inner man.<p>The fact that the Father strengthens us by the indwelling Spirit does not mean that the Spirit is not with us or that the Spirit will come down from the heavens to strengthen us. The strengthening Spirit has been with us from the time He regenerated us. He is still within us now. Through this indwelling Spirit the Father strengthens us from within.<p>According to Ephesians 3:16, we are being strengthened into the inner man. The inner man is our regenerated spirit with God&#8217;s life as it&#8217;s life. It is our spirit regenerated by the Spirit of God (John 3:6), indwelt by the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:11, 16), and mingled with the Spirit of God (1 Cor. 6:17). In order to experience Christ unto all the fullness of God, we need to be strengthened into the inner man. This implies that we need to get into our spirit, where we can be strengthened through the Holy Spirit.<p>Through the Spirit the Father strengthens us into the inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts through faith. Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul-the mind, the emotion, and the will-plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit. These are the inward parts of our being. Through regeneration Christ came into our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22). Now we should allow Him to spread Himself into every part of our heart. Our heart is the totality of all our inward parts and the center of our inward being; therefore, when Christ makes His home in our heart, He controls our entire inward being and supplies and strengthens every inward part with Himself.<p>In order for Christ to not be imprisoned in us but to have the freedom to settle down in the depths of our being, we need to be strengthened by the Spirit into our inner man. Therefore, the indwelling Spirit is working to strengthen us into the inner man.<h2 class=head2>30. By Him They Live and Walk</h2><p>The believers in Christ should live and walk by the Spirit (Gal. 5:16, 25). Paul does not charge us to walk according to doctrine, not even according to certain Bible verses. This does not mean, however, that our walk should not be according to the Bible. The point here is that Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit in a living way. We need to know the Bible and obey it. Nevertheless, strictly speaking, we need to walk according to the Spirit in our spirit. This requires our daily practice.<p>There is a difference between living by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit. To live means to have life and also to exist. A Christian, as a believer in Christ, has been born of God and has the Spirit of sonship. He has the life of the Spirit and exists by the Spirit. To live by the Spirit is to have life and exist by the Spirit. To walk means to move, act, speak, and do things by the Spirit. All of our living and walking should be by the Spirit who is in us.<p>In Galatians 5:16 Paul says, &#8220;Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.&#8221; The Christian walk is absolutely by the Spirit. According to the context of chapter five, the Spirit in 5:16 must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in our regenerated spirit and mingles with it. To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit within our spirit.<p>The word &#8220;walk&#8221; in verse 16 means to move, act, and have our being. It includes everything we do and say. Hence, it covers our whole daily life. In this verse Paul is charging us to have our daily life-to live, walk, and have our being-by the Spirit. Paul even had the confidence to say that if we walk by the Spirit, we shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.<p>In Galatians 5:25 Paul goes on to say, &#8220;If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.&#8221; To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit. To walk by the Spirit is to have our practical living and acts in our daily life guided and ruled by the Spirit. Paul&#8217;s concept is that since our life is by the Spirit so our walk should also be by the Spirit. The Greek word rendered &#8220;we live&#8221; implies both to have life and to live. Initially we have life, but continually we live. If we have life by the Spirit, we should continue to live by the Spirit. A fuller rendering of the Greek here would be, &#8220;If we have life and live by the Spirit.&#8221; Paul uses a similar expression in Romans 1:17 and Hebrews 10:38. In Hebrews 10:38 it is not a matter of having life but of continuing to live by the life we have received. In Romans 1:17 and Galatians 5:25 it is a matter of both having life initially and then living continually.<p>In Galatians 5:16 and 25 Paul uses two different Greek words for walk, indicating thereby that in the New Testament there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The Greek word for walk in verse 16, peripateo, means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about. It is used with respect to ordinary daily life. It denotes a common, habitual daily walk. This understanding of walking by the Spirit is confirmed by verses 22 and 23, where Paul speaks of the fruit of the Spirit. The various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in these verses are not unusual things; they are aspects of our ordinary daily life. Therefore, the walk in verse 16 is our habitual and common daily walk.<p>The Greek word for walk in verse 25, stoicheo, means to march in military rank by keeping step, that is, to walk orderly. It is the verbal form of stoicheion, element; hence, it can be translated &#8220;to observe the elements,&#8221; &#8220;to walk according to the elements.&#8221; It is derived from a root which means to arrange in a line. Thus, the Greek word for walk here means to walk in line. It also means to march in military rank. Walking in this way, like soldiers marching in rank, requires that we keep in step.<p>As we compare these two kinds of walk, we see that the second is more regulated than the first. In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about. However, both kinds of walk, the common, ordinary walk and the walking in line or in rank, are by the Spirit.<p>Every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit. The first walk is our daily walk; the second is the walk in the divine rules and steps. As Christians, we are not those walking about without a purpose. We have been created by God and also re-created and regenerated by Him with a definite purpose. Therefore, we must have the second kind of walk, a walk to fulfill God&#8217;s purpose and to reach the goal of our life on earth. The indwelling Spirit leads us to have both kinds of walk. In the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we live, have our being, and walk about by the Spirit. This walk is a support to the second walk, a walk with a direction toward a goal. As children of God, we are not those without purpose. Our lives on earth have a definite purpose. We do not walk about aimlessly. God has an eternal purpose, and His intention is that His people should live for His purpose. Both God&#8217;s creation of us and His regeneration are for the carrying out of His purpose. Because God is purposeful and seeks to reach His goal, He charges us to have two kinds of walk by the Spirit: the walk which builds up a proper daily living and the walk in line with the divine rules and principles to reach the goal established by God.<p>In the first kind of walk by the Spirit we take the Spirit as the essence of our life. Then whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have will be by the Spirit as our essence. This means that our essence will be the Triune God processed to become our constituent. If we take the Spirit as our essence, every aspect of our daily life will be by the Spirit.<p>The first kind of walk by the Spirit is for the second- that of taking the Spirit as the path for our way. We all must walk along a certain way. The path of this way should be the Spirit Himself. For the first kind of walk, the Spirit is our essence; for the second kind, the Spirit is our way. The Spirit Himself is the way, the rule, the line, the principle, leading toward God&#8217;s goal. The Spirit Himself should be our rule. If we would have the second walk by the Spirit, we must take the Spirit as our rule, our way.<p>When we have the first kind of walk, that of taking the Spirit as our essence, we shall be able to have the second kind of walk toward God&#8217;s goal. If we are one with the all-inclusive Spirit, He will no doubt lead us to walk in Himself as our way. As a result, the Spirit becomes the rule, the principle, leading to God&#8217;s goal. Spontaneously the Spirit becomes the lane, the regulation on the way to God&#8217;s goal. Thus, the all-inclusive Spirit becomes the path of our way. If we walk along this pathway, we shall surely reach God&#8217;s goal, and His purpose will be accomplished.<h2 class=head2>31. Fighting for Them against the Flesh</h2><p>As the Spirit works in the believers, He fights for them against the flesh. Galatians 5:17 says, &#8220;The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other, that you should not do those things which you desire.&#8221; This verse indicates that there is a war between the flesh and the Spirit. The flesh and the Spirit oppose each other. The flesh lusts against the Spirit for its own desire, and the Spirit fights against the flesh for God&#8217;s purpose. In ourselves we cannot defeat the lustful flesh. We need to trust the indwelling Spirit, who is fighting for us against the flesh.<h2 class=head2>32. Bearing the Fruit of Life in Many Aspects in Their Life</h2><p>According to Galatians 5:22 and 23, the Spirit works in the believers to bear the fruit of life in many aspects in their life: &#8220;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law.&#8221; What the flesh does is &#8220;works&#8221; without life (v. 19); what the Spirit brings forth is &#8220;fruit,&#8221; full of life. The fruit of the Spirit, as different expressions of the Spirit who is life within us, is listed here with only nine items as illustrations. It has more items, including lowliness (Eph. 4:2; Phil. 2:3), compassion (Phil. 2:1), godliness (2 Pet. 1:6), righteousness (Rom. 14:17; Eph. 5:9), holiness (Eph. 4:24; Luke 1:75), purity (Matt. 5:8), and other virtues. Both in Ephesians 4:2 and Colossians 3:12 lowliness is mentioned as a virtue other than meekness, which is listed here. In Romans 14:17 righteousness, peace, and joy are all aspects of the kingdom of God today. But only peace and joy, not righteousness, are listed here. In 2 Peter 1:5-7 godliness and endurance are counted with self-control and love as characteristics of spiritual growth, but they are not listed here. In Matthew 5:5-9 righteousness, mercy, and purity are reckoned with meekness and peace as the condition of the reality of the kingdom today. However, these three virtues are not named here.<p>As the flesh is the expression of the old Adam, so the Spirit is the realization of Christ. Christ is actually lived out in the Spirit. The nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit listed here are the very characteristics of Christ.<p>The fruit of the Spirit includes the different expressions of the indwelling Spirit. After listing nine aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, Paul declares that &#8220;against such things there is no law&#8221; (v. 23). Notice that Paul says &#8220;such things,&#8221; not &#8220;these things.&#8221; Had he said &#8220;these things,&#8221; the fruit of the Spirit might be limited to the nine items listed in these verses. But the fact that Paul spoke of &#8220;such things&#8221; indicates that there are many more aspects than the nine he uses as illustrations.<p>We need to differentiate between our natural virtues and those virtues which are the fruit of the Spirit. The difference between natural virtues and the fruit of the Spirit is that the natural virtues do not have anything of the Spirit, whereas the fruit of the Spirit is full of the substance and element of the Spirit.<p>The result of walking by the Spirit will be the fruit of the Spirit. There is no need for us to strive to love, to keep the peace, or to be joyful. Actually, there is no need to strive to possess any of the Christian virtues. Instead, we need simply to live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit. Then the fruit of the Spirit will be brought forth automatically. As we walk by the Spirit, the fruit of the Spirit will come forth with many aspects as virtues. These virtues are not works; they are different aspects of the expression of the unique living fruit that is produced by walking by the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>33. Longing within Them unto Envy for God against Worldliness</h2><p>James 4:4-5 reveals that the Spirit within the believers longs unto envy for God against worldliness: &#8220;Adulteresses, do you not know that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever determines to be a friend of the world is constituted an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain: The Spirit who dwells in us longs to envy?&#8221; Here James uses marriage to illustrate our relationship with God. God is the Husband, and we are His counterpart. As God&#8217;s counterpart, we should love Him. If we love anything or anyone in place of Him, we become adulteresses. The indwelling Spirit whom God has put within us longs to keep us singly for Himself. Whenever we would not be solely for Him but would love the world, this indwelling Spirit will not only be offended but also envious. This is the correct understanding of what James means when he says that the Spirit who dwells in us longs to envy.<p>Just as a husband longs to envy over his wife, so the Spirit longs unto envy for God concerning us. For us to love anything worldly is to have another husband. Worldliness replaces God as our Husband. This indwelling Spirit always envies when He sees us loving something other than God. When we love the world or any material thing other than God, the indwelling Spirit envies. He longs to see us loving God absolutely. When a husband sees his wife loving someone else other than him, this husband longs to envy. God as the indwelling Spirit is our Husband and He longs to envy when He sees that we love something, someone, or some matter other than Him. This requires us to deal with whatever we love other than God. Therefore, the indwelling Spirit works within us to separate us from everything other than God and to keep us for God Himself. The Spirit works in this way that we may receive the unique dispensing of the Triune God into us for our transformation.<h2 class=head2>34. As the Sword for Them to Fight against the Power of Darkness and the Evil Things</h2><p>The indwelling Spirit is the sword for the believers to fight against their spiritual enemies, the power of darkness and the evil things. In Ephesians 6:17 Paul speaks of &#8220;the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God.&#8221; The antecedent of the word &#8220;which&#8221; is Spirit, not sword. This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God, both of which are Christ (2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 19:13). Among the six items of God&#8217;s armor, only the Spirit as the sword is the one for attacking the enemy. With this sword we cut the enemy to pieces.<p>The sword, the Spirit, and the word are one. The word is the Bible. But if this word is only printed letters, it is neither the Spirit nor the sword. The Greek word for &#8220;word&#8221; in Ephesians 6:17 is rhema, the instant word spoken at the moment by the Spirit in any situation. When the logos, the constant word in the Bible, becomes the instant rhema, this rhema will be the Spirit. This rhema which becomes the Spirit is the sword that cuts the enemy to pieces.<p>The Bible is the word of God. But apart from the Spirit, the Bible is merely dead letters to us. The Spirit makes the letters of the Bible the living word of God. Therefore, the Spirit is the word of God, and such a Spirit is a sword, a weapon, for us to fight the battle against God&#8217;s enemy to bring in His kingdom.<p>If we would enjoy the Spirit as the sword for fighting against the enemy, we must come to the word of the Bible, receiving the word by means of all prayer. By praying with the Scriptures in this way, the Spirit within us becomes the sword by which we slay all negative things.<h2 class=head2>35. Not to Be Grieved by Them</h2><p>The indwelling Spirit should not be grieved by the believers. In Ephesians 4:30 Paul says, &#8220;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.&#8221; To grieve the Holy Spirit is to displease Him. The Holy Spirit abides in us forever (John 14:16-17); He will never leave us. But He is grieved when we do not walk according to Him (Rom. 8:4). If, according to Ephesians 4, we have a life according to the principle of truth with grace for the details of our daily walk, we shall not grieve the Holy Spirit of God. However, if we do not live this way, the Spirit within us will be grieved.<p>For the Holy Spirit to be grieved means that He is not happy with us. Often when we feel unhappy, that feeling of unhappiness is actually the feeling of the Holy Spirit. However, when He feels happy within us, we are happy also. A proper life according to truth and in grace will always make the Holy Spirit happy and give us the joy of the Spirit.<p>The Spirit who should not be grieved by us is the Spirit in whom we were sealed unto the day of redemption. Once the Spirit comes into us, He will always be with us. Even if we offend Him, He remains within us. We cannot be divorced from the Spirit, but we can surely grieve Him. We have been sealed with the Holy Spirit, and this sealing will continue to take place unto the day of redemption. This sealing brings the divine element into us. Day by day the divine element is being added into us, and the divine mark within us is being made more evident. Furthermore, God&#8217;s ownership of us is strengthened more and more. Eventually, this sealing will bring us into the redemption of our body, which will be the transfiguration of our body. We should not be those who grieve this sealing Spirit.<h2 class=head2>36. Not to Be Quenched by Them</h2><p>The Spirit should not be quenched by the believers. First Thessalonians 5:19 says, &#8220;Do not quench the Spirit.&#8221; The Spirit makes our spirit burning (Rom. 12:11) and our gifts flaming (2 Tim. 1:6). So we should not quench Him.<p>The Christian life is a life inspired and stirred up by the Spirit. Throughout the day we should have the Spirit inspiring us, stirring us, and moving and acting within us. Thus, instead of quenching the Spirit, we need to fan the flame that is within us. The word &#8220;quench&#8221; in 1 Thessalonians 5:19 implies fire. The Spirit is burning within us. We should not quench this fire, but instead we should fan it into flame.<p>How do we know that we are quenching the Spirit? We know that the Spirit is quenched when we ourselves feel quenched. If we are quenched, the Spirit also is quenched. But if we are released, the Spirit too is released. Our being released is an indication that the Holy Spirit within us is free and not quenched.<h2 class=head2>37. Not to Be Insulted by Them</h2><p>Finally, in the inner-life-stage the Spirit should not be insulted by the believers. Hebrews 10:29 warns us not to insult the Spirit of grace. Ephesians 4:30 tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit of God, which means to make Him unhappy by disobeying Him. However, to insult, despise, put aside, ignore, or neglect the Spirit is more serious. None of us should do this.<p>If we feel shameful, this is an indication that the Holy Spirit within us has been insulted. If we are unhappy, the Spirit has been grieved. If we are quenched, the Spirit has been quenched. If we feel ashamed, the Spirit has been insulted. Instead of grieving, quenching, or insulting the Spirit, we should experience the Spirit as the totality of the Triune God for our enjoyment. Then, through the work of the indwelling Spirit, we shall feel happy, released, and glorious.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY-TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><p>We have covered the first two stages of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers for the divine dispensing. The first stage has twelve aspects, from enlightening, sanctification, and regeneration through sanctification. The second stage, which we have called the inner-life-working stage, has twenty-five aspects, from transformation through not insulting the Spirit. We come now to the third stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in us-the stage of the Spirit&#8217;s fellowship.<p>The Spirit is the fellowship between the Triune God and His chosen people. For this reason, 2 Corinthians 13:14 speaks of the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is also the fellowship among the believers. Therefore, the Spirit is the fellowship between the Triune God and the believers and also the fellowship the believers have with one another. The element of each of the twenty-five aspects of the third stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in us is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.<h2 class=head2>38. As the Means for Them to Pray</h2><p>Jude 20 speaks of &#8220;praying in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The Spirit is the means for us to pray, and to pray is to have fellowship with the Triune God. By prayer we are preserved in our fellowship with the Triune God. Praying in the Holy Spirit is thus the means for us to maintain a continual fellowship with the Lord. The Holy Spirit is also the sphere and element of our prayer. We pray in this sphere and by this element to keep ourselves in fellowship with the Triune God.<p>According to Jude 20, if we would build up ourselves in our most holy faith, we need to pray in the Holy Spirit. Faith is related to the Word, and in the Holy Spirit we have life. In this verse the Holy Spirit refers mainly to life, not to power. However, some Christians today understand the Holy Spirit mainly in terms of power. In Romans 8:2 Paul speaks of the Holy Spirit as the Spirit of life. From experience we know that praying in the Holy Spirit is much more a matter of life than of power. When we pray we may not sense power; however, we often have the sense of life. Life is more precious than power.<p>Verses 20 and 21 of Jude instruct us to pray in the Holy Spirit so that we may be preserved in the Triune God. We should keep ourselves in the love of God by building up ourselves in our holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit. In this way we await the mercy of our Lord that we may not only enjoy eternal life in this age but inherit it for eternity. The entire divine Trinity is employed and enjoyed by the believers in their praying in the Holy Spirit, keeping themselves in the love of God, and awaiting the mercy of the Lord unto eternal life. The enjoyment and inheritance of eternal life, the life of God, is the goal of our spiritual seeking. Because we aim at this goal, we want to be kept in the love of God, pray in the Holy Spirit, and await the mercy of our Lord.<h2 class=head2>39. Helping Them in Their Weakness</h2><p>The Spirit who indwells the believers helps them in their weakness. Romans 8:26a says, &#8220;In like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness.&#8221; In particular, weakness here is our weakness in prayer. Prayer exposes our weakness. It is not easy for us to pray. We may have the energy to do many other things, but we may not have the energy needed to pray. Even if we have the desire to pray, we may not have the energy, strength, and ability to carry out our desire. This indicates that we are weak in God&#8217;s interest and in the divine things. Therefore, the indwelling Spirit works in us to help us in our weakness, especially in our weakness in praying to have fellowship with the Triune God.<p>According to Romans 8:26a, it is &#8220;in like manner&#8221; that the Spirit joins in to help us in our weakness. The phrase &#8220;in like manner&#8221; has an all-inclusive meaning. This phrase includes matters covered in foregoing verses in Romans such as expecting, eagerness, groaning, endurance, and hope. While we are groaning, the Holy Spirit also is groaning. While we are expecting, He is expecting. While we are hoping and enduring, He is hoping and enduring. Whatever we are, He is also the same. In like manner the Spirit joins in to help us. What a comfort this is! While we are groaning, watching, and expecting, the Spirit also is groaning, watching, and expecting. He is the same as we are. If we are weak, He apparently is weak also, although actually He is not. He sympathizes with our weakness. He appears to be weak for the sake of our weakness in order to participate in it. When we pray loudly, He also prays loudly. He also prays softly when we pray softly. We may say, &#8220;O Father, I am pitiful. Have mercy on me.&#8221; When we pray in this way, the Spirit prays for us in like manner. In whatever way we pray, He also prays. In whatever we are, He also is. If we pray quickly, rejoicingly, and shoutingly, He also prays in this manner. Our manner is His manner.<p>We should not think that the Spirit is so different from us that when we receive the Spirit we shall be extraordinary people. This is not the thought in Romans 8. Romans 8 reveals that the Holy Spirit is in our manner. The Spirit prays in our manner. In whatever manner we are, He also is.<p>In Romans 8:26a Paul also says that the Spirit joins in to help us. He participates in our weakness in order to help us. The Spirit does not ask us to join in with Him; rather, He joins in with us. The Spirit joins in in our manner. If our manner is quick, He will also be quick. If we are slow, He will be slow. Whether we pray strongly or weakly, loudly or softly, it does not matter to Him. As we pray, He will pray in us in like manner. In like manner the Spirit joins in to help us in our weakness.<h2 class=head2>40. Interceding for Them with Groanings in Them</h2><p>In Romans 8:26b Paul says, &#8220;We do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.&#8221; When we are weak, unable to pray, the Spirit comes in to strengthen us. Then we may begin to pray. However, although we may be burdened to pray, we may not know what to say, or we may lack utterance. Then we may begin to sigh and to moan. This is the groaning of the Spirit within us.<p>The Spirit intercedes for us with groanings in our manner. This groaning apparently is our groaning, but in our groaning is the groaning of the Spirit. This is why His groaning is in the same manner as our groaning. He is in us, and His groaning is in our groaning. He groans with us in like manner. This is the best prayer we can have for the growth in life. Many of our prayers are utterable with clear words, but they may not issue from our spirit. However, when we have a real burden to pray, yet we do not know how to utter it, then spontaneously we may groan with that burden without any utterable word. This will be the best prayer within which the Spirit intercedes for us by groaning together with us.<p>This kind of unutterable prayer is primarily for the growth in life, concerning the true need of which we do not have much understanding. Concerning our material needs and business affairs we are clear and have the utterance to pray about them. But concerning the matter of our growth in life we are lacking in both understanding and utterance. As we seek the Lord regarding the growth in life, deep within our spirit we may be burdened with some prayer about which we have no clear understanding and for which we have no utterance. Spontaneously, therefore, we are forced to groan. While we are groaning from deep within our spirit, the Spirit who dwells in our spirit automatically joins in with our groaning, interceding for us mainly that we may have the transformation in life for growth in the maturity of sonship.<p>The interceding Spirit helps us, sympathizes with us, sustains us, comforts us, and supports us by interceding for us. At times we may feel weak and depressed. But within us, even at such times, there is something sustaining, supporting, encouraging, and comforting us. There is something within us telling us not to be disappointed. Although we are weak, there is a support within us. There is even a certain kind of prayer going on within us and for us. This is the work of the interceding Spirit, and this is the intercession of the helping Spirit, who understands us thoroughly. The Spirit helps us in every kind of situation, for He knows our needs, problems, and shortcomings, and He sympathizes with us, supports us, and sustains us.<h2 class=head2>41. Infusing His according-to-God Mind into Them in Their Prayer</h2><p>As the Spirit works in the believers by helping them in their weakness and by interceding for them with groanings, He infuses His according-to-God mind into them in their prayer. &#8220;He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God&#8221; (Rom. 8:27). Whereas Ephesians 4:23 speaks of the spirit of the mind, this verse speaks of the mind of the Spirit. The spirit of the mind is for renewing, and the mind of the Spirit is for interceding.<p>Actually, it is difficult to say to whose mind Paul is referring in Romans 8:27, because the Spirit is mingled with our spirit and the Spirit is interceding within us. In our groaning there is the groaning of the Spirit. The Spirit groans in our groaning. We may even say that it is the Spirit&#8217;s groaning groaned by us, expressed by us. Thus, it is actually our groaning. In the same principle, in verse 27 we have the Spirit&#8217;s mind, but now the Spirit&#8217;s mind is one with our mind because our mind is set on the spirit (v. 6).<p>Sometimes we are burdened to pray, but do not know what to say. At such times we may groan, &#8220;O Lord, O Lord.&#8221; This is our groaning because it is uttered by us, yet that groaning begins from the mingled spirit. It begins in our spirit and comes out of the depths of our being. This is not merely a sound of groaning. Within our groaning there is a mind because there is a thought or meaning in this groaning. This means that the mind is involved, but whose mind is it? It is not merely the Spirit&#8217;s mind; it is the Spirit&#8217;s mind mingled with our mind. Our mind is set on the spirit, making our mind one with the mind of the Spirit.<p>Romans 8:27 says that He who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit. Whose heart is mentioned here? Surely this is not the heart of the Spirit; this must be our heart. God searches our hearts, yet He knows what is the mind of the Spirit. This proves that the mind here is not the independent mind of the Spirit; it is the mind of the Spirit mingled with our mind and becoming a part of our heart. It is our heart and the Spirit&#8217;s mind. God searching our heart knows the mind of the Spirit. This indicates that our mind is one with the Spirit. The Spirit&#8217;s mind is one with our mind, and our mingled mind even becomes a part of our heart. The New Testament revelation gives us a clear view of such a mingling. Our mind can be set on the spirit, making our mind one with the Spirit. Hence, the Spirit&#8217;s mind is one with our mind, and this mingled heart, this mingled mind, becomes a part of our spirit. Now when we groan, our groaning is not a religious prayer but an aspiration from the depths of our being, where the mingling of divinity with humanity is. This is the result of the Spirit&#8217;s work of infusing His according-to-God mind into us.<h2 class=head2>42. As the Means for Them to Guard the Good Deposit</h2><p>The Holy Spirit working in us is the means for us to guard the good deposit. Paul charged Timothy: &#8220;Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us&#8221; (2 Tim. 1:14). This deposit consisted in that which was committed and entrusted to Timothy, the healthy words which he received from Paul, not only for himself but also for others. During the years Timothy was with Paul, many truths were deposited into him by Paul. As a result, there was within Timothy a good deposit, a deposit that he was to guard by means of the indwelling Holy Spirit.<p>From the time we were saved we have received many things from God as a deposit, like a deposit in a bank. Within us, and especially within our spirit, we have a divine deposit. God&#8217;s life, God&#8217;s Spirit, and all the precious truths we have seen in the Lord&#8217;s recovery have been deposited into our being. How can we guard this deposit? We can guard this deposit only through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us. If we act, behave, and have our life in the Spirit, all that has been deposited into us will be guarded. But if we neglect the Spirit and walk in the flesh and according to our mind, we shall be the same as the nations, who are apart from God (Eph. 4:17-18). If this is our situation, there will not be any guarding of the good things that have been deposited into our being. We need to guard the good deposit by the Spirit, who is working within us to keep us in the divine fellowship. As we are preserved in fellowship with the Triune God, we shall have an intensified care for all the truths that have been deposited into our being. Because the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, guarding the good deposit through the Holy Spirit requires that we exercise our spirit.<h2 class=head2>43. Unto Him They Sow and of Him They Reap in Their Life</h2><p>Unto the Spirit the believers sow, and of the Spirit they reap in their life. Galatians 6:8 says, &#8220;He who sows unto his own flesh, shall reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.&#8221; The Greek word translated &#8220;unto&#8221; in this verse also means with a view to or for. To sow unto the flesh is to sow with a view to the flesh, or for the flesh, with the purpose of the flesh in view, fulfilling what the flesh covets. To sow unto the Spirit is to sow for the Spirit, with the aim of the Spirit, accomplishing what the Spirit desires. To sow for the fulfilling of the purpose of the flesh issues in corruption; to sow for the accomplishing of the aim of the Spirit issues in life, even eternal life. Corruption is of the flesh, indicating that the flesh is corrupted; eternal life is of the Spirit and is the Spirit Himself.<p>Sowing covers the totality of our Christian life. Everything we do is some kind of sowing, either to the flesh or to the Spirit. Wherever we may be and whatever we are doing, we are sowing seeds. It is crucial for us to realize that the Christian walk must be a walk by the Spirit and a life of sowing unto the Spirit. We shall always reap what we sow. If we sow unto the flesh, we shall reap corruption of the flesh. If we sow unto the Spirit, we shall reap eternal life of the Spirit.<p>It is very important to understand what Paul means by sowing. Because of his human experience and what he had learned and because of the revelation he received from God, Paul had a thorough understanding of human life. His use of the word &#8220;sow&#8221; in Galatians 6:8 points to the true meaning of human life. According to Paul&#8217;s understanding, human life is a process of sowing. Day by day we are sowing. We sow by what we say and do and by what we are. To sow is to put forth something that will grow and eventually be reaped. In our daily living we are constantly putting forth things that will grow and bring forth a harvest. Even a word uttered by us contains seeds that will land in a particular soil, grow, and produce a harvest that we shall reap. The word &#8220;sowing&#8221; is actually equal to living. To be careful in our sowing is to be watchful concerning our living.<p>Because sowing causes a certain result, Paul warned us to be careful of our sowing. If we sow unto the flesh, we shall of the flesh reap corruption. But if we sow unto the Spirit, we shall reap of the Spirit eternal life. Therefore, in 6:8 flesh stands in contrast to the Spirit, and corruption in contrast to eternal life. There are only two kinds of sowing and two kinds of reaping. There is no neutrality, no third kind of sowing or reaping. No doubt, corruption includes death. Sowing unto the flesh will always produce a harvest of corruption, whereas sowing unto the Spirit will always produce a harvest of life eternal.<p>Paul&#8217;s words strongly imply that we need to make a decision with respect to our aim, our goal. Will our aim be the flesh, or will it be the Spirit? Paul speaks of sowing unto the flesh and unto the Spirit. To sow unto the flesh is to have the flesh as the goal. But to sow unto the Spirit means to sow with a view to accomplishing the purpose of the Spirit. This is to have the Spirit as our goal. Thus, the Spirit should be not only our life and walk but also the goal of our living. There is no neutral ground between the flesh and the Spirit. Our goal is either one or the other. It cannot be anything else.<p>As believers, we are not aimless, for we have a goal, an aim, that controls and directs us. Whatever we do, we do with a view toward this goal. Therefore, Paul charges us to sow unto the Spirit, to live unto the Spirit, to say and do everything with a view to the Spirit. We need to take the Spirit as our unique and eternal goal. God&#8217;s goal is to become the all-inclusive Spirit in us for our enjoyment. God&#8217;s economy, therefore, is to give us Himself as the Spirit. Now we should take the Spirit as our aim, our goal.<p>Finally, we need to see the reason for sowing unto the Spirit. In Galatians 6:15 Paul speaks of the new creation. Paul&#8217;s mention of the new creation here gives us the reason for sowing unto the Spirit. The result of sowing unto the Spirit is a new creation. Hence, we should sow unto the Spirit for the new creation. When we aim at the Spirit and sow unto the Spirit, the Spirit makes us a new creation. Furthermore, as we sow unto the Spirit, we shall walk by the Spirit. Then spontaneously we shall be the new creation in a practical way, for the divine Spirit will mingle Himself with us and constitute us of Himself to make us new. For this new creation we need the Holy Spirit to work in us to keep us continually in the divine fellowship. Then in our daily living we shall sow unto the Spirit and of the Spirit reap eternal life.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY-THREE</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(8)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the third stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers for the divine dispensing. The Spirit&#8217;s work in this stage is to keep us in fellowship with the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>44. Confessing to Them That Christ Came in the Flesh</h2><p>The Spirit works in the believers to confess to them that Christ came in the flesh. First John 4:2 says, &#8220;In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God.&#8221; According to this verse, the discernment of spirits is based upon whether or not a spirit confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. Because the spirit of a genuine prophet is motivated by the Holy Spirit of truth, this spirit will confess the divine conception of Jesus and affirm that He was born as the Son of God. Every such spirit is surely out of God. In this we know the Spirit of God.<p>The word &#8220;flesh&#8221; in 1 John 4:2 is very important. As human beings, we were all born of flesh to be flesh (John 3:6a). Thus every human being is flesh. To confess Jesus Christ coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God (Luke 1:31-35). Christ is God incarnate to become a man through divine conception. He did not have a human father, for He was conceived of the Holy Spirit. His conception is divine because it was carried out by the Holy Spirit. Although Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit, this conception took place in the womb of a virgin. Therefore, He, the very God, became a man in the flesh. Contrary to the false teaching of the Docetists, His body was not a phantasm. Rather, He had a real body, a physical body that was solid in its substance. He was conceived of the Holy Spirit; He became flesh and was born of the virgin Mary. Because He was conceived of the Spirit to be born in the flesh, the Spirit would never deny that He has come in the flesh through divine conception.<p>Anyone who denies that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh denies that He was conceived of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, anyone who rejects Jesus Christ coming in the flesh rejects His humanity and His human living. Such a one also rejects Christ&#8217;s redemption. If Christ had not become a genuine man, He could not have had human blood to shed for the redemption of human beings. If He had not become flesh through the conception of the Holy Spirit in the womb of the virgin Mary, He never could have been our Substitute to be crucified to bear our judgment before God. Therefore, to deny that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is to deny His divine conception, His incarnation, His birth, His humanity, His human living, and also His redemption. The New Testament makes it emphatically clear that Christ&#8217;s redemption was accomplished in His human body and by the shedding of His blood.<p>Anyone who rejects Christ&#8217;s incarnation and thereby rejects His redemption also denies Christ&#8217;s resurrection. If Christ had never passed through death, it would not have been possible for Him to enter into resurrection.<p>Denying that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is a great heresy. This heretical teaching makes it impossible to have the enjoyment of the Trinity. According to the revelation of the Trinity in the New Testament, the Son came in the flesh with the Father and in the name of the Father. The Son was crucified, and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we have the Spirit as the reality of the Son with the Father. This includes incarnation, human living, redemption by the shedding of human blood, death in a human body, burial, and resurrection. All these are components, constituents, of our enjoyment of the Triune God. If anyone denies Christ&#8217;s incarnation, that one denies Christ&#8217;s holy birth, humanity, human living, redemption through crucifixion, and resurrection. This utterly annuls the enjoyment of the genuine Trinity. In the light of this we see the crucial importance of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers to confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.<p>When we are kept by the Spirit in the divine fellowship with the Triune God, the Spirit will show us, will confess to us, that the Lord Jesus is still a human being, that He is human as well as divine. This means that even after His resurrection and ascension the Lord Jesus is still a man. Therefore, in the divine fellowship we may continually enjoy Him as a human being, especially as the One who, in His humanity, can sympathize with our weaknesses and problems. In our fellowship with the divine Trinity the third, the Spirit, confesses, testifies, that the second, who is our Savior, is still a man. This work of the Spirit to confess the humanity of the Lord Jesus to us is truly a comfort.<h2 class=head2>45. Testifying Together with the Water and the Blood That Christ Is the Son of God</h2><p>On the one hand, the Spirit confesses Christ&#8217;s humanity, that He has come in the flesh; on the other hand, the Spirit confesses Christ&#8217;s divinity, that He is the Son of God. In the believers the Spirit testifies together with the water and the blood that Christ is the Son of God (1 John 5:6-9). The Spirit, being the truth, the reality, testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is eternal life (1 John 5:5-12). By thus testifying, the Spirit imparts the Son of God into us to be our life (Col. 3:4).<p>First John 5:6 says, &#8220;This is He who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ; not in the water only, but in the water and in the blood; and the Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.&#8221; He, Jesus Christ, came as the Son of God so that we may be born of God and have the divine life (John 10:10; 20:31). It is in His Son that God gives us eternal life (1 John 5:11-13). Jesus of Nazareth was testified to be the Son of God by the water He went through in His baptism (Matt. 3:16-17; John 1:31), by the blood He shed on the cross (John 19:31-35; Matt. 27:50-54), and also by the Spirit He gave not by measure (John 1:32-34; 3:34). By these three God has testified that Jesus is His Son given to us so that in Him we may receive His eternal life by believing in His name (John 3:16, 36; 20:31). The water of baptism terminates people of the old creation by burying them; the blood shed on the cross redeems those whom God has chosen from among the old creation; and the Spirit, who is the truth, the reality and life (Rom. 8:2), germinates those whom God has redeemed out of the old creation by regenerating them with the divine life. Thus they are born of God and become His children (John 3:5, 15; 1:12-13) to live a life that practices the truth (1 John 1:6), the will of God (1 John 2:17), the righteousness of God (1 John 2:29), and the love of God (1 John 3:10-11) for His expression.<p>First John 5:6 says that the Spirit testifies because the Spirit is the truth. The Spirit, who is the truth, the reality (John 14:16-17; 15:26), testifies that Jesus is the Son of God, in whom is eternal life. By thus testifying, He imparts the Son of God into us to be our life (Col. 3:4). In 1 John 5:6 &#8220;truth&#8221; denotes the reality of all that Christ is as the Son of God (John 16:12-15).<p>First John 5:7 and 8 say, &#8220;Because there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are for the one.&#8221; &#8220;For the one&#8221; also means unto the one, that is, unto the one thing, the one point or purpose in their testimony.<p>First John 5:6-10 says that God testified that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. God testified this in three steps: by the water, by the blood, and by the Spirit. The water refers to the baptism of the Lord Jesus. According to the record of the four Gospels, immediately after the Lord came up from the water, the heavens were opened and a voice declared that He is God&#8217;s beloved Son. This was God&#8217;s testimony that Jesus Christ is His Son, the testimony by water, by baptism. Three and a half years later, the Lord Jesus died on the cross, shedding His blood. Someone standing near the cross testified, after the Lord died, that He was God&#8217;s Son. That was the testimony of God by blood concerning Jesus Christ being the Son of God. Following this, we have the testimony of the Spirit. In resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit.<p>If we read 5:6 carefully, we shall see that the Lord Jesus came through water and through blood, but we are not told that He came through the Spirit. Then in verses 7 and 8 we are told clearly that there are three who testify, and that these three are the Spirit, the water, and the blood. Christ came through the water, through the blood, and as the Spirit. In resurrection He came as the Spirit. Furthermore, according to verse 6, Christ came in the water and in the blood, but this verse does not say that He came in the Spirit. Concerning the Spirit, this verse has the thought of being, for we are told, &#8220;The Spirit is He who testifies.&#8221; Therefore, Christ came through the water, through the blood, and as the Spirit.<p>The water of baptism terminates the old creation, and the blood shed on the cross redeems whatever God has chosen of the old creation. Then the Spirit comes to germinate what God has chosen and redeemed. Therefore, here we have termination, redemption, and germination. As the old creation, we have been terminated. But as God&#8217;s chosen ones, we were first redeemed and then germinated to be the new creation. By the three steps of termination, redemption, and germination, Jesus Christ has not only been testified as the Son of God but has also entered into our spirit. This means that by termination, redemption, and germination Christ is now within us.<p>As the Spirit works in us to preserve us in fellowship with the Triune God, we enjoy the humanity of the Lord Jesus and also His divinity, concerning which testimony was borne by the water at His baptism and by the blood at His death. Now the Spirit testifies with the water and the blood that Jesus Christ is divine, that He is the Son of God.<h2 class=head2>46. As the Means for Them to Take Christ as Their Righteousness by Faith</h2><p>The Spirit is the means for the believers to take Christ as their righteousness by faith. &#8220;We by the Spirit by faith eagerly expect the hope of righteousness&#8221; (Gal. 5:5). &#8220;By the Spirit&#8221; here is in contrast with &#8220;by the flesh&#8221; (Gal. 3:3). Furthermore, &#8220;by faith&#8221; is in contrast with &#8220;by the works of law&#8221; (Gal. 3:2). The hope of righteousness is the righteousness we hope for, which is Christ Himself (1 Cor. 1:30). It is not by works of law in the flesh but by faith in the Spirit. Christ is our hope of righteousness. He is our righteousness today, and He is our hope to come. We are not looking for earthly success. By the Spirit and by faith we expect Christ as the hope of righteousness.<p>It is in the divine fellowship that we through the Spirit as the means take Christ as our righteousness by faith. As we enjoy Christ in fellowship with the Triune God, we realize that every day, even every moment, Christ is our righteousness. Of ourselves we do not have any righteousness; on the contrary, our righteousness is the Christ whom we live. When we live Christ, He is our righteousness. We do not have our own merit before God. Our only merit before God is the Christ whom we live daily. Therefore, in our fellowship with the Triune God we do not take our behavior or character as our merit. Instead, we take Christ as our merit, as our righteousness, enjoying Him in our fellowship with God.<p>In Galatians 5:5 Paul puts the Spirit together with faith. According to Galatians 3:14, the Spirit is typified by the good land. Faith may be compared to a camera that photographs the divine scenery. In order to have the proper enjoyment of Christ, we need the Spirit as the all-inclusive land and faith as the means to enjoy this land. Then as we enjoy the Spirit by faith, we eagerly expect the hope of righteousness.<h2 class=head2>47. Witnessing with Their Spirit That They Are the Children of God</h2><p>Romans 8:16 says, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&#8221; There is a Witness within us who testifies that we are children of God. This means that within us someone is reminding us that we are God&#8217;s children. Sometimes this reminding One regulates us or safeguards us. This regulating comes from the Spirit, who is witnessing with our spirit.<p>In Romans 8:14 Paul speaks of the sons of God, and in verse 15, of the spirit of sonship. Why in verse 16 does he suddenly speak of the children of God? The reason is that the Spirit witnesses to something basic. He witnesses to our primary or initial relationship with God. We may be children without the growth of a son, and we may be sons without the qualification of an heir. For the Holy Spirit to witness that we are all heirs of God would be premature. Most of us are not mature enough for such a witness. Thus, the Spirit witnesses to the most basic and elementary relationship-that of being the children of God. He witnesses with our spirit that we are God&#8217;s children.<p>Romans 8:16 does not say &#8220;in our spirit&#8221; but &#8220;with our spirit.&#8221; If this verse said &#8220;in our spirit,&#8221; this would mean that only the Spirit of God witnesses but that our spirit does not witness. However, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, meaning that both witness together. The Spirit of God witnesses, and simultaneously our spirit witnesses together with Him. However, sometimes we may not feel that the Spirit is witnessing within us. But we cannot deny the fact that our spirit is witnessing. As long as our spirit is witnessing, the Holy Spirit also is witnessing. In his wisdom Paul said that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, for the two spirits have been mingled together as one. With our spirit the Spirit witnesses that we are God&#8217;s children.<p>Often we exercise our mind to try to figure out certain things related to our Christian life. From experience we know that this is a distraction. What we need is the living witness of the Spirit. According to 8:16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, not with our mind. Paul says clearly and explicitly that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.<p>Furthermore, the Spirit bears witness that, as children of God, we should not do certain things or go to certain places. Many times this witnessing bothers us. On the one hand, it assures us that we are children of God. On the other hand, it convicts us when we do things that are not in keeping with being a child of God. This indicates that to be a child of God is to be limited and restricted. However, this limitation and restriction is not a suffering but a protection. Thank the Lord that we are preserved and protected by the inner witnessing of the Spirit with our spirit.<p>The work of the indwelling Spirit in witnessing with our spirit that we are children of God is also a matter of the divine fellowship. As the Spirit keeps us in fellowship with the Triune God, we enjoy being children of God. We have the sweet and intimate inward sense that we are God&#8217;s children.<h2 class=head2>48. Crying with Their Spirit, Abba, Father</h2><p>The Spirit who indwells the believers cries with their spirit, Abba, Father. Two verses speak of this. &#8220;Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&#8221; (Gal. 4:6). &#8220;You have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father&#8221; (Rom. 8:15). We have received a spirit of sonship by the Spirit of God coming into our spirit. Because the Spirit of God has entered into our spirit, our spirit has become a spirit of sonship.<p>Galatians 4:6 says that God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts. Actually the Spirit of God came into our spirit at our regeneration (John 3:6; Rom. 8:16). Because our spirit is hidden in our heart (1 Pet. 3:4), and because the word here refers to a matter that is related to our feeling and understanding, both of which belong to our heart, it says that the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son was sent into our heart.<p>Romans 8:15 and Galatians 4:6 are parallel verses. Romans 8:15 says that we who have received a spirit of sonship cry, in this spirit, Abba, Father, whereas Galatians 4:6 says that the Spirit of God&#8217;s Son is crying in our heart, Abba, Father. This indicates that our regenerated spirit and the Spirit of God are mingled as one and that our spirit is in our heart. Whether we cry or the Spirit cries, we both cry together. When we cry, He cries in our crying. When He cries, we cry with Him. According to grammar, the subject of crying in Romans 8:15 is &#8220;we,&#8221; but in Galatians 4:6 the subject of crying is &#8220;the Spirit.&#8221; These verses prove that our spirit and the Spirit are one. When we cry, Abba, Father, He joins with us in our crying. The Spirit cries in our crying because the Spirit of the Son of God indwells our spirit.<p>&#8220;Abba&#8221; is an Aramaic word, thus a Hebrew word, which means father, and &#8220;Father&#8221; is the translation of the Greek word pater. Such a term was first used by the Lord Jesus in Gethsemane while praying to the Father (Mark 14:36). The combination of the Hebrew title with the Greek expresses a stronger affection in crying to the Father. Such an affectionate cry implies an intimate relationship in life between a genuine son and a begetting father. When these two terms Abba and Father are put together, the result is a deep, sweet sense, a sense that is exquisitely intimate. &#8220;Abba, Father&#8221; is sweetness intensified. The sense we have when calling in this way is sweet and intimate. We enjoy this sweetness and intimacy in our fellowship with the Triune God.<p>Although the Spirit of sonship has come into our spirit, the Spirit cries in our hearts, Abba, Father. This indicates that our relationship with our Father in the sonship is sweet and very intimate. How tender and sweet it is to call God, Abba, Father! Such an intimate calling involves our emotion as well as our spirit. The Spirit of sonship in our spirit cries, Abba, Father, from our heart. This proves that we have a genuine relationship in life with our Father. We are His real sons.<h2 class=head2>49. Bearing Witness in Their Conscience</h2><p>As the Spirit works in the believers, He bears witness in their conscience. In Romans 9:1 Paul says, &#8220;In Christ I speak the truth, I lie not, my conscience bearing witness with me in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This verse proves that the conscience is a part of the human spirit. We have seen that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit (Rom. 8:16). However, in this verse we are told that our conscience bears witness in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, because the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit and our conscience witnesses with the Holy Spirit, our conscience must be part of our spirit.<p>As we enjoy fellowship with the Triune God, our conscience often confirms our standing, and the Spirit bears witness to our standing in our conscience. However, the situation may also be the opposite. If we do something wrong or are on the wrong standing, the Spirit in our conscience will witness to us in a negative way. Both the positive and negative witness of the Spirit in our conscience is the work of the Holy Spirit in our enjoyment of the divine fellowship.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY-FOUR</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(9)</h1><p>We have seen that in the third stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers the Spirit works to maintain our fellowship with the Triune God. In this message we shall consider further aspects of this stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work.<h2 class=head2>50. Anointing Them</h2><p>The New Testament reveals that the Spirit anoints the believers. Second Corinthians 1:21 says, &#8220;He who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God.&#8221; In Greek Christ means the anointed One. Christ, the anointed One, is full of ointment, full of anointing. Because we have been attached to Him, we have been anointed also. In the universe there is only One who has been anointed by God, and this One is Christ, the anointed One. Now we are all in this anointed One. We have been anointed by being attached to Him. The Spirit moves in us, anointing God Himself into us that the element of God may become our constituent and that we may know God and desire His will in everything.<p>Two verses in the Epistle of 1 John refer to the work of the Spirit in anointing the believers. First John 2:20 says, &#8220;You have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.&#8221; Verse 27 of the same chapter goes on to say, &#8220;The anointing which you received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as it has taught you, abide in Him.&#8221; According to grammar, the word &#8220;anointing&#8221; is a gerund, a verbal noun. Such a noun conveys action. As used in these verses, the anointing denotes something experiential that is taking place within us. The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit. The anointing is just the function of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit. If we carefully read 1 John 2:20-27, we shall realize that the anointing is actually the personification of the compound Spirit, who is the processed Triune God. This all-inclusive Spirit from the Holy One entered into us at the time of our regeneration and abides in us forever.<p>The Triune God reaches us as the Spirit. If God were only the Father and the Son, He could not enter into us. It is only as the Spirit that the Triune God can enter into our spirit. The word anointing in 1 John 2:20 and 27 refers mainly to the Spirit. Actually, the ointment is the Spirit, and the anointing is the moving of this ointment. When we speak of the anointing, we mean the Triune God reaching us as the Spirit. When the Triune God comes into our spirit, He is the life-giving Spirit. This life-giving Spirit, who dwells in our spirit, is now moving within us. This moving is the anointing.<p>The anointing Spirit in 1 John 2 is the fulfillment of the type of the compound ointment in Exodus 30. In this compound ointment there are a number of different elements that are ingredients of the ointment. These elements include the processed Triune God and His activities. The Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. These are the steps in His activity. All these steps have become elements of the compound, life-giving Spirit. Therefore, the anointing Spirit is actually a compound of the Triune God and His activities. The anointing Spirit includes divinity and humanity, the divine nature and the human nature. Such a compound Spirit includes incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. All these are elements of the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30.<p>In the compound Spirit we have the Father, the Son, the Spirit, divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, the effectiveness of Christ&#8217;s death, the power of His resurrection, and His ascension. The anointing is the moving of this compound Spirit with all His elements. By applying Himself to us in this way, the compound Spirit teaches us concerning the Triune God and His activities.<p>In verse 27 John says, &#8220;You have no need that anyone should teach you.&#8221; Concerning the indwelling of the divine Trinity (John 14:17, 23), we do not need anyone to teach us. By the anointing of the all-inclusive, compound Spirit, who is a composition of the divine Trinity, we know and enjoy the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as our life and life supply.<p>According to verse 27, the anointing of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit teaches us concerning all things, which are the things concerning the divine Trinity. This is not an outward teaching by words; it is an inward teaching by the anointing through our inner spiritual consciousness. This teaching by the anointing adds the divine elements of the Trinity, which are the elements of the anointing compound Spirit, into our being. As a result, the Triune God is transfused, infused, and added into all the inward parts of our being so that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements.<p>Only through the Triune God becoming the anointing Spirit can we be taught concerning the Triune God and His activities. This kind of teaching is not objective; rather, it is very subjective. The Triune God has become the anointing Spirit, and His anointing is now within us. This subjective anointing, the moving of the composition of the Triune God with all His activities, can now teach us the things concerning the Triune God and His activities. Therefore, it is such an anointing that teaches us the things concerning the Triune God.<p>The anointing has much to do with our abiding in the Lord. This abiding is a matter of the Lord as the Spirit dwelling in our spirit. Apart from the anointing, we cannot abide in the Lord. If we do not abide in the Lord, we cannot maintain our fellowship with the Triune God. Furthermore, if we do not maintain the divine fellowship, we cannot enjoy the riches of the divine life. We may also say that to enjoy the riches of the divine life, we need to maintain the fellowship; to maintain the fellowship, we need to abide in the Lord; and in order to abide in the Lord, we need to take care of the inner anointing, which is the moving of the indwelling Spirit in our spirit.<p>First John 2:27 concludes with an exhortation to abide in the Triune God. The Greek word translated &#8220;abide&#8221; is meno, a word that means to stay (in a given place, state, relation, or expectancy); hence, abide, remain, and dwell. To abide in Him is to abide in the Son and in the Father. This is to remain and dwell in the Lord (John 15:4-5). It is also to abide in the fellowship of the divine life and to walk in the divine light (1 John 1:2-3, 6-7). We should practice this abiding according to the teaching of the all-inclusive anointing so that our fellowship with God may be maintained.<h2 class=head2>51. Sealing Them</h2><p>After referring to the anointing in 2 Corinthians 1:21, Paul goes on to say in verse 22 that God &#8220;has also sealed us and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.&#8221; Actually, the anointing is the sealing. Because God has anointed us with Christ, He has also sealed us in Him.<p>We should not regard the sealing as separate from the anointing, for anointing implies sealing. As we are under the anointing, the anointing becomes a sealing. In this way we become different from others. Furthermore, the seal causes us to bear the appearance of God. When God anoints us, the anointing is the sealing. First God through the anointing adds the essence of Himself into us. Then this anointing seals us with the essence of God and makes us the image of God. Therefore, anointing brings in the element, and sealing produces the impression, the image.<p>Two verses in Ephesians speak of the Spirit sealing the believers. Ephesians 1:13 says, &#8220;You were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise.&#8221; Ephesians 4:30 says, &#8220;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption.&#8221; The Spirit Himself is the seal. Furthermore, the seal of the Spirit involves movement within us. Therefore, the seal is actually the sealing. On the one hand, the Spirit is the seal upon us; on the other hand, the Spirit is now sealing us. Thus, the seal of the Holy Spirit is living, and it works within us to permeate and transform us with God&#8217;s element until we are matured in God&#8217;s life and eventually fully redeemed, even in our body.<p>To be sealed with the Holy Spirit means to be marked with the Holy Spirit as a living seal. When we were saved, God put His Holy Spirit into us as a seal to mark us out, indicating that we belong to God. The Holy Spirit, who is God Himself entering into us, causes us to bear God&#8217;s image signified by the seal. This seal indicates that God is our owner and that we belong to Him.<p>The Spirit as the seal of God upon us bears the image of God. This implies that the seal of the Spirit is the expression of God. When we bear the Holy Spirit as the seal of God, we bear the image of God and the expression of God.<p>The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God and the reaching of the Triune God to us. When He seals us, the entire Triune God reaches us. The Spirit not only reaches us; He is also attached to us (2 Cor. 1:21). The reaching is His attaching, and the attaching is also His dispensing. The Triune God has been dispensed into us. He has reached us, and He has been attached to us. The divine sealing, the life-dispensing of the Triune God, is now taking place within us continually.<p>The sealing of the Spirit is unto the redemption of the acquired possession (Eph. 1:13b, 14b). We were acquired by God as His possession. From the day He acquired us, He began the sealing in order to saturate us with the Triune God. It is too objective simply to say that we have God&#8217;s seal upon us as a mark. We not only have a seal; we also have a sealing to saturate our entire being with God&#8217;s element. Our body, which is still natural, has not yet been redeemed. But we have a sealing, the saturating, of the Holy Spirit, within us, and this sealing will continue until the day our body is fully saturated. That will be the redemption of our body, the redemption of God&#8217;s acquired possession. Now, as God&#8217;s acquired possession, we are still under the sealing of the Spirit.<p>At the time of our regeneration, the seal of the Spirit was put into our spirit, and the sealing began within us, with a view to the redemption of our body. This indicates that one day even our body will be sealed with the Spirit, saturated with the Spirit. Therefore, the seal of the Spirit is not merely a once-for-all matter. Rather, the sealing is still taking place. The seal was put in us when we believed, but the sealing has been going on from that time until now. The Holy Spirit is the seal and also the sealing. We were sealed, and we are still being sealed.<h2 class=head2>52. Pledging in Them</h2><p>The Spirit also pledges in the believers. Second Corinthians 1:22 says that God has &#8220;given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.&#8221; The pledge of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself as the pledge. Sealing is a mark that we are God&#8217;s inheritance, God&#8217;s possession. The pledge is a guarantee that God is our inheritance or heritage belonging to us. The Spirit within us is the pledge, an earnest, of God being our portion in Christ.<p>The Greek word rendered &#8220;pledge&#8221; also means a foretaste, guarantee, token payment guaranteeing the full payment, a partial payment in advance. Because we are God&#8217;s inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a seal upon us. Because God is our inheritance, the Holy Spirit is a pledge of this inheritance to us. God gives His Holy Spirit to us not only as a guarantee of our inheritance, securing our heritage, but also as a foretaste of what we shall inherit of God. This affords us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance that is coming.<p>In the purchase of land in ancient times, the seller would give the buyer some soil from the land as a sample. This sample was called by the Greek word for pledge. Hence, according to ancient Greek usage, a pledge is also a sample. The Holy Spirit is a sample of what we shall inherit in full.<p>God&#8217;s attaching us to Christ issues in three things: an anointing that imparts God&#8217;s element into us, a sealing that forms the divine element into an impression to express God&#8217;s image, and a pledging that gives us a sample and guarantee of the full taste of God. These three matters-anointing, sealing, and pledging-are actually one. They are one thing with three aspects. First we are anointed, then we are sealed, and then we have the pledge as a guarantee. We have the essence, the image, and the guarantee. All these are the processed Triune God who is now the all-inclusive Spirit. The Spirit is the ointment with which we are anointed, the essence with which we are sealed, and the pledge which guarantees that God belongs to us and that He is our portion.<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:22 Paul tells us that the pledge of the Spirit is in our hearts. Because this pledge is in our hearts, it becomes part of our consciousness. Now we may be conscious of the fact that the Spirit is within us as a pledge.<p>Second Corinthians 5:5 says, &#8220;He who has wrought us for this very thing is God, who has given to us the pledge of the Spirit.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;wrought&#8221; also means fashioned, shaped, prepared, made fit. God has wrought, fashioned, shaped, prepared, made us fit for the very purpose that our mortal body may be swallowed up by His resurrection life (2 Cor. 5:4). Thus, our entire being will be saturated with Christ. God has given us the Spirit as the pledge, the earnest, the foretaste, the guarantee, of this wonderful and marvelous part of His complete salvation for us in Christ.<p>In relation to God&#8217;s shaping, Paul says that God has given to us the pledge of the Spirit. This indicates that the main factor of God&#8217;s shaping us is His putting Himself into us as the life-giving Spirit to be a pledge. This means that God has pledged Himself to accomplish this for us. He has placed Himself as the life-giving Spirit into our spirit to guarantee that one day He will clothe us with a body of resurrection. We have a pledge that we have been made and qualified for this purpose.<p>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Spirit is &#8220;the pledge of our inheritance.&#8221; The pledge of the Spirit also involves movement within us. The Spirit is not only a pledge guaranteeing our inheritance; He is now pledging within us. Hence, the pledge of the Spirit is not merely a once-for-all matter, for the Spirit is continually pledging within us.<p>We need both the sealing and the pledging of the Spirit because in God&#8217;s work on us two kinds of inheritances are involved. Ephesians 1:11 indicates that we were made God&#8217;s inheritance, and verse 14, that God is our inheritance. In God&#8217;s economy we are an inheritance to God, and God is an inheritance to us. This is a mutual inheritance. For us to be God&#8217;s inheritance, we need the sealing. Because God is our inheritance, we also need the pledging of the Holy Spirit as a guarantee. We shall inherit all that God is and has. For such an inheritance, the Spirit is the pledge, the guarantee.<p>On the day we were saved God began to pledge Himself to us, and this pledging continues day by day. The pledging of the Spirit is given for our enjoyment. Whenever we are disappointed or depressed the pledging comes in to uplift us. Pledging also means that something is given to us as a guarantee. Through the Spirit&#8217;s pledging we are encouraged and stirred up. Whenever we feel that our situation is hopeless, the pledging of the Spirit fills us with hope.<p>Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit is the pledge of our inheritance &#8220;unto the redemption of the acquired possession.&#8221; The redemption here refers to the redemption of our body (Rom. 8:23), that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious one (Phil. 3:21). The Holy Spirit today is a guarantee, a foretaste, and a sample of our divine inheritance until our body is transfigured in glory, at which time we shall inherit God in full.<p>The pledging of the Spirit involves the dispensing of the Triune God into us. Every day the Spirit is pledging Himself into our being as our foretaste. This foretaste of the pledging is a guarantee of the full taste. The Triune God is pledging Himself into our being. This is the dispensing of the Spirit. The more we enjoy the divine fellowship through the Spirit, the more opportunity the Spirit has to dispense Himself into us by anointing us, sealing us, and pledging in us. Therefore, in our fellowship with the Triune God, we experience the Spirit&#8217;s anointing, sealing, and pledging.<h2 class=head2>53. Being the Firstfruit (Foretaste) of Their Divine Inheritance</h2><p>The indwelling Spirit is the firstfruit (foretaste) of the believers&#8217; divine inheritance, which is the Triune God Himself. Romans 8:23 says, &#8220;We ourselves also, having the firstfruit of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly expecting sonship, the redemption of our body.&#8221; The word &#8220;firstfruit&#8221; here refers to a foretaste that is a guarantee that we shall experience the full taste. God Himself is the full taste, and He has given us His Spirit as the firstfruit to be our foretaste. This means that within us we have the Spirit of God for our enjoyment and this enjoyment is the foretaste and guarantee that we shall have the full taste. This is the guarantee that at the Lord&#8217;s coming back we shall enjoy God in full.<p>The firstfruit of the Spirit is not the foretaste of the coming age (Heb. 6:5) but the firstfruit of the rich God to be our portion. The foretaste of the coming age is a taste of outward things, but the firstfruit is the foretaste of the processed Triune God Himself. What we have enjoyed and what we are still enjoying of God is just a foretaste. The full taste is coming. The Holy Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit, is the firstfruit of all the riches of God&#8217;s being for our enjoyment. We are tasting a foretaste of God, and a full taste will come. We shall enjoy the full taste of the Triune God in eternity.<h2 class=head2>54. Being the Access for Them to Contact the Triune God</h2><p>Ephesians 2:18 reveals that the Spirit is the access for the believers to contact the Triune God: &#8220;Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.&#8221; Here the Trinity of the Godhead is implied. Through God the Son who is the Accomplisher, the means, and in God the Spirit who is the Executor, the application, we have access to God the Father, who is the Originator. Through Christ the Son we have access in one Spirit unto the Father. Notice that this verse does not say that we have access unto the Spirit; it speaks of access unto the Father. The Spirit is unto us, whereas we are unto the Father. The Father came to us in the Son, and the Son came into us as the Spirit. Now through the Son the Spirit brings us unto the Father. This is for the dispensing of the Triune God into us so that the church may come into existence.<p>To have access unto the Father is to contact God for enjoyment. Whenever we come to God to contact Him, we enjoy Him. There is no enjoyment better than this. When we contact God, we come to Him through Christ in the Spirit to the Father. This is the divine Trinity in our experience as our enjoyment. We all have been sealed with the Spirit as a pledge that God is our inheritance for us to enjoy. Now through the Son in the Spirit we come to the Father to enjoy Him.<p>According to the context, this verse also indicates that through Christ all the Jewish and Gentile believers, who were once at enmity, have access to the Father in one Spirit for their enjoyment. No matter whether we are Jewish or Gentile believers, we all are coming to the Father, through the Son, in the one Spirit, to enjoy the Father as our inheritance.<p>The access in one Spirit is unto the Father. Positionally we were reconciled to God; experientially we have access unto the Father. To be reconciled to God is to be saved; to have access unto the Father is to enjoy God, who, as the source of life, has regenerated us to be His sons. In the one Body we have been reconciled to God through the cross (Eph. 2:16). This is a fact. Now we have access unto the Father and contact Him directly. This is an experience. Having been reconciled to God once for all, we now have access to the Father for a continual enjoyment.<p>Chapter two of Ephesians tells us that God loved us (v. 4), enlivened us (v. 5), raised us up (v. 6), and seated us in the heavenlies (v. 6), to make us His poem, His masterpiece (v. 10). The God who did this is the Father as the source acting through a channel, Christ the Son. When the Son came, He came in the Father&#8217;s name (John 5:43); He came with the Father (John 8:29; 16:32). The Father is the source who planned all things, and the Son is the means, the course, who accomplished the Father&#8217;s purpose. Christ became the channel in which and by which God enlivened us, raised us up, and seated us in the heavenlies. After His death and resurrection, Christ came as the Spirit to preach the gospel (Eph. 2:17). When the Spirit came, He came with the Father (John 15:26) in the Son&#8217;s name (John 14:26). This means that when the Spirit came, the Son came. Therefore, when the Son comes to preach the gospel to us, the Spirit also comes. When we receive the Son in His preaching, we receive the Spirit. The Spirit then brings us back to the Father through the Son. The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father through the Son. Through this wonderful two-way traffic we enjoy the dispensing of the Triune God.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY-FIVE</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(10)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the third stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers for the divine dispensing. This is the stage in which the Spirit works in us to keep us in fellowship with the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>55. Partaken Of by Them</h2><p>The Spirit is partaken of by the believers. Hebrews 6:4 indicates that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and we are partakers of such a One. We have not only received the Holy Spirit; we are now partakers of the Holy Spirit. As long as we have the Spirit, we are His partakers.<p>The book of Hebrews was written to show the Jewish believers that the believers in Christ have Him as a wonderful treasure, a treasure that is much more precious than the angels, Moses, Aaron, and the old covenant. This treasure is the all-inclusive Christ. However, in our practical experience Christ is the all-inclusive Spirit. Hence, Hebrews does not say that we are partakers of the all-inclusive Christ but that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit.<p>The Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, is also the reaching to us of the Triune God. Without being the Spirit, the Father and the Son could not reach us. The reaching of the Triune God is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the reality of the new covenant, which is superior to the old covenant. Now, in a way that is actual and practical, we are partakers of the all-inclusive Spirit. Because we partake of this Spirit, we partake of and enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches. In the divine fellowship we partake of the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>56. Being the Fellowship- the Participation in the Enjoyment-of the Triune God to Them</h2><p>Eventually, the Spirit is the fellowship, the participation in the enjoyment, of the Triune God to the believers. Actually, this fellowship is a totality of all the aspects of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the third stage, the stage of maintaining our fellowship with the Triune God.<p>Among the sixty-six books of the Bible, 2 Corinthians is unique in that it concludes with a blessing: &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&#8221; (13:14). This blessing is composed of attributes of the Triune God: grace, love, and fellowship. The love of God the Father is the source, the fount, and grace is the flow, the expression, of love. Love is with the Father as the source, and grace is with the Son as the expression. The fellowship of the Holy Spirit is a matter of communication, transmission. Therefore, love is the source, grace is the flow, and fellowship is the transmission of the flow with the source. In this way we have love, grace, and fellowship as our enjoyment, and we participate in them.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 clearly says that grace is of Christ, love is of God, and fellowship is of the Holy Spirit. Because the book of 2 Corinthians emphasizes grace, grace is mentioned first in 13:14. As presented in 2 Corinthians, grace is actually the Triune God embodied in the Son and transmitted into our being through the Spirit for our enjoyment. Hence, grace is the Triune God as our life, life supply, and enjoyment. This grace issues out from the Father&#8217;s love and is transmitted into our being by the Spirit. Therefore, we have the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit-the full enjoyment of the Triune God.<p>The grace of Christ is the rich element of Christ, the love of God is the rich element of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the aggregate of the rich element of Christ and God transmitted into our being for our spiritual enjoyment. In this fellowship we enjoy the rich elements of the Triune God, which are the elements for our transformation. Day after day the rich elements of the Triune God are being transmitted into us, and we are being transformed.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that in 2 Corinthians 13:14 love, grace, and fellowship are not three separate matters. Rather, they are three aspects of one thing. Love is the source, grace is the expression of the source, and fellowship is the transmission of the expression. Love as the source is expressed in grace, and this grace is transmitted into us by fellowship. The love of God is the source of the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit is the transmission of the grace of Christ with the love of God. Therefore, love, grace, and fellowship are all within us for our enjoyment.<p>We enjoy love, grace, and fellowship all at the same time. While we enjoy the fellowship of the Spirit, we also have the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God. Just as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not three Gods, so love, grace, and fellowship are three aspects of one thing. The Triune God is the Father full of love, the Son full of grace, and the Spirit full of fellowship. We should not think that we successively enjoy the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Spirit. No, we enjoy the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Spirit simultaneously.<p>Although we enjoy love, grace, and fellowship simultaneously, it is nevertheless true that love is the source, grace is the course, and fellowship is the destination. Our destination is the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. With such a destination, we enjoy the Triune God in the three aspects of love, grace, and fellowship.<p>Second Corinthians 13:14 is a strong proof that the Trinity of the Godhead is not for the doctrinal understanding of systematic theology, but for the dispensing of God Himself into His chosen and redeemed people. In the Bible the Trinity is never revealed merely as a doctrine. On the contrary, it is revealed or mentioned in regard to the relationship of God with man, especially with His chosen and redeemed people. In order to redeem fallen man that He might still have the position to be one with man, God became incarnated (John 1:1, 14) in the Son and through the Spirit (Luke 1:31, 35) to be a man and lived a human life on earth, also in the Son (Luke 2:49) and by the Spirit (Luke 4:1; Matt. 12:28). At the beginning of the Lord&#8217;s ministry on earth, the Father anointed the Son with the Spirit (Matt. 3:16-17; Luke 4:18) for reaching men and bringing them back to Him. Just before He was crucified in the flesh and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), the Lord unveiled His mysterious trinity to His disciples in plain words (John 14-17) stating that the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son (14:9-11), that the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son (14:16-20), that the three, co-existing and coinhering simultaneously, are abiding with the believers for their enjoyment (14:23; 16:7-10; 17:21-23), and that all the Father has is the Son&#8217;s and all the Son possesses is received by the Spirit to be revealed to the believers (16:13-15). Such a Trinity is altogether related to the dispensing of the processed Triune God into His believers (14:17, 20; 15:4-5), that they may be one in and with the Triune God (17:21-23).<p>After His resurrection Christ charged His disciples to disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19), that is, to bring the believing ones into the Triune God, into an organic union with the processed God who has passed through incarnation, human living, and crucifixion and has entered into resurrection. It is based upon such an organic union of the believers with the Triune God that Paul, at the conclusion of his second Epistle to the Corinthians, blesses the believers with the blessed Trinity in the participation of the Son&#8217;s grace with the Father&#8217;s love through the Spirit&#8217;s fellowship. Such an enjoyment of the Triune God is possible through the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers to be the fellowship of the Triune God to them.<h2 class=head2>57. Being the Oneness of the Body of Christ</h2><p>The Spirit who dwells in us and works in us is the oneness of the Body of Christ. Ephesians 4:3 says, &#8220;Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.&#8221; To have the proper Body life we need to keep the oneness of the Spirit. This is crucial and vital to the Body of Christ.<p>Oneness, strictly speaking, differs from unity. Unity is formed by many people coming together, whereas oneness is the one entity of the Spirit within the believers making them all one. Our oneness is the Lord Jesus Himself realized as the life-giving Spirit. Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit within us, and this Spirit is our oneness. Therefore, our oneness is the Spirit indwelling us as our life.<p>In Ephesians 4:3 this oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit. The oneness of the Spirit is actually the Spirit Himself, not something apart from the Spirit. If we talk about oneness but neglect the Spirit, this indicates that we regard oneness as something separate from the Spirit. The oneness within us and among us is the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, to keep the oneness is to keep the life-giving Spirit. Because the Spirit is the oneness of the Body, we should not act, move, work, or speak without the Spirit. We need to live, move, walk, and have our being in the Spirit. Then we shall keep the oneness. The only way to keep the oneness of the Spirit is to be in the Spirit. There is no other way.<p>In Ephesians 4:4 Paul continues, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling.&#8221; The Body is mentioned before the Spirit because the oneness among us is related to the Body and is for the Body. The reason we need to keep the oneness is that we are all one Body.<p>The Spirit is the essence of the one Body. Without the Spirit, the Body would be empty and have no life. The Body here is the Body of Christ, and the essence of the Body of Christ is the Spirit. Hence, the Body and the essence of the Body are one. It is impossible for the Body of Christ to have  more than one essence. The unique essence of the Body is the Spirit.<p>The Spirit is in the Body. First Corinthians 12:13 says, &#8220;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&#8221; This reveals that the one Spirit is not only the essence of the Body but also the life and the life supply of the Body. Apart from the one Spirit, the Body could not exist as a living organism. Without the Spirit it is impossible to have the Body.<p>The Spirit is the reality of the Triune God. Therefore, the oneness of the Spirit denotes the oneness of the Triune God wrought into us. This oneness is called the oneness of the Spirit, and this Spirit is the Spirit in the Body. For this reason, Ephesians 4:4 speaks of one Body and one Spirit. This indicates that the Spirit is not only for the Body but in the Body. In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body. The Spirit is in the Body, not only in individual members. &#8220;One Body and one Spirit&#8221; means that this one Spirit is wrought into our being and constituted into our being so that we may be constituted into one Body. The Body is the constitution of the one Spirit. When we say, &#8220;One Body and one Spirit,&#8221; we mean that the Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, that the one Spirit has been wrought into the being of the one Body. Eventually, because the Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, we can say that the Body is one with the Spirit.<p>To build the Body is to have the Spirit wrought into us and constituted into us, to saturate and permeate every fiber of our being, to make us one with the Spirit. The church is the very constitution of the divine Spirit. The one Body and the one Spirit, therefore, are not two separate entities. On the contrary, the one Body is one with the Spirit, and the one Spirit is one with the Body. This is the reason there must not be any division in the church. Because the Spirit is one, there can be only one Body.<p>The fact that Ephesians 4:4 mentions the one hope of our calling along with the one Body and one Spirit implies that the indwelling Spirit is carrying out the process of bringing the Body of Christ into glory as the fulfillment of our hope. Therefore, in this verse we have the one Body, the one Spirit, and the one hope. Because we are all in the one Body with the one Spirit and have the one hope, we are one. There is no reason for us not to be one, and there is no cause to be different. We are one Body, and we have the one Spirit working within us to bring us to the goal of our hope. As we remain through the Spirit in the divine fellowship, we are kept by the Spirit in the unique oneness of the Body, a oneness that is the indwelling Spirit Himself.<h2 class=head2>58. Freeing Them from the Letters of the Law</h2><p>As the Spirit works in the believers, He also frees them from the letters of the law. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&#8221; When the heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away (v. 16). Furthermore, the Lord is the Spirit who gives us freedom. Because the Lord is the Spirit, when the heart turns to Him, the veil is taken away, and the heart is freed from the bondage of the letter of the law.<p>The Spirit frees us from regulations, rituals, religious teachings, and traditional doctrines. At Paul&#8217;s time the Old Testament law was a great bondage. The Lord as the Spirit frees us from the bondage of the law. The Jews were under the bondage of circumcision, the bondage of dietary regulations, and the bondage of the Sabbath. Today, however, is not the age of Moses and of the law in letters, but the age of the Lord Jesus being the Spirit, the pneumatic Christ. Moses, with the letter of the law, put the people under bondage, but with Christ there is no bondage to the law. With Him as the Spirit there is full freedom. Formerly we were under bondage to the letters of the law, but now the life-giving Spirit frees us from this bondage. Therefore, instead of being divided by doctrines, we are kept by the Spirit in the unique oneness of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>59. Showing Them the Way of the Holy of Holies</h2><p>Hebrews 9:8 reveals that the indwelling Spirit shows the believers the way of the Holy of Holies: &#8220;The Holy Spirit showing by this, that the way of the Holy of Holies has not yet been manifested while the first tabernacle still has its standing.&#8221; At that time the way of the Holy of Holies, that is, the way of the New Testament, had not been manifested. To say that the way into the Holy of Holies was not manifested while the first tabernacle still had its standing means that the way to enter into the new covenant had not yet been opened. In Hebrews 10:19 and 20 we see that a new and living way has been freshly cut. This is the way to enter into the Holy of Holies, into the new covenant.<p>The first tabernacle, the Holy Place, signifies the old covenant, and the second tabernacle, the Holy of Holies, signifies the new covenant. Now the veil that closes the Holy of Holies has been riven (Matt. 27:51) by the death of Christ since it has crucified the flesh (Gal. 5:24), and the way of the Holy of Holies has been manifested. Hence, we do not need to remain in the Holy Place, in the old covenant, in the soul; we must enter the Holy of Holies, the new covenant, in the spirit. This is the goal of the book of Hebrews. The writer&#8217;s concept is that the Holy of Holies and the new covenant are one; the Holy of Holies is the new covenant. When we come into the Holy of Holies, we come into the new covenant; and when we come into the new covenant, we enter into the Holy of Holies.<p>The Holy Spirit tells us that when the old tabernacle still remained, the way to enter the Holy of Holies was not yet opened. Further, by this illustration the Spirit tells us that the way to enter into the Holy of Holies has been opened and that the old tabernacle has been removed. Today we do not have the old tabernacle; we have the new tabernacle-Christ. In the book of Hebrews the tabernacle is Christ, and the offerings also are Christ. Christ is realized as the Spirit. Therefore, when we have the Spirit, we have the tabernacle and the offerings. As the eternal Spirit, Christ is everything, and this Spirit is subjective within us. This eternal Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God has become our eternal enjoyment.<p>Now that the Spirit within us is showing us the way to enter the inner chamber of God&#8217;s dwelling place, we should not remain either in the outer court or in the Holy Place. Rather, we should enter into our spirit and thereby enter into the Holy of Holies to dwell with God and enjoy Him as love, light, and every divine thing. This is the result of the Spirit&#8217;s work in us to keep us in the enjoyment of the fellowship with the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>60. Testifying to Them the Law of Life of the New Covenant</h2><p>The Holy Spirit testifies to the believers the law of life of the new covenant. &#8220;The Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after having said, This is the covenant which I will covenant with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws upon their hearts and upon their minds I will inscribe them; then He says, And their sins and their lawlessnesses I will by no means remember any more&#8221; (Heb. 10:15-17). In this chapter the writer of Hebrews is seeking to prove to the believers that there was no longer any need of offering the sacrifice for sin, because Christ has accomplished the putting away of sins. The problem of sin has been solved. Now the writer emphasizes this fact by pointing out that in Jeremiah 31:33 and 34, which is quoted in chapter eight for the inward law of life, the Holy Spirit also testifies to this effect. In Jeremiah 31:33 and 34, after the Holy Spirit said that God would put His laws upon their hearts, He then said that God would not remember their sins anymore. This proves that the Holy Spirit testifies that our sins have been taken away and that the problem of sin has been solved. Not only in Isaiah 53:6, 11 and 12 was there the prediction that Christ would bear our sins, but in Jeremiah 31 there was the testimony of the Holy Spirit that our sins would be taken away and that God would no longer have any remembrance of them.<p>According to our natural understanding of the new covenant, the forgiveness of sins is the first item. However, it is the last item, even a supplementary one. The new covenant is mainly concerned with three things: the law of life which is written into our being, God being God to us and us being a people to Him, and the inner ability of knowing God. These three things are eternal. But because we may still remember our sins, we need a supplement telling us that God will by no means remember our sins and lawlessnesses. The crucial point here, however, is that the Spirit testifies to us the law of life of the new covenant. When we are in the Holy of Holies, that is, when we are in the mingled spirit, we realize that there is such a thing as the law of life. We are freed from the regulation of the law in letters, and now the law of life of the new covenant is real to us in our fellowship with the Triune God.<h2 class=head2>61. As the Means for Them to Serve-Worship-God</h2><p>Philippians 3:3 says, &#8220;We are the circumcision, who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.&#8221; Here we see that the Spirit is the means for the believers to serve-worship- God. The Greek word rendered &#8220;serve&#8221; here means to serve as a priest. All New Testament believers are priests to God (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6). Hence, our ministry to the Lord, in whatever aspect, is a priestly ministry, a priestly service. Furthermore, those who are the circumcision here are the New Testament believers, the ones genuinely circumcised by Christ&#8217;s crucifixion. They are absolutely different from the Judaizers. They serve as priests by the Spirit of God, not by the ordinances of law; they boast in Christ, not in the law; and they have no confidence in the flesh, but have their confidence in the Spirit.<p>In Philippians 3:2 and 3 there is a threefold contrast: believers who serve by the Spirit of God in contrast to the dogs; believers who boast in Christ in contrast to evil workers; and believers who have no confidence in the flesh in contrast to the concision. The Judaizers lived by their fallen nature, whereas the believers in Christ serve by the Spirit of God. Thus, the Spirit of God is in contrast to the nature of the &#8220;dogs.&#8221; According to the revelation in these verses, anyone who tries to do something for God without being in the Spirit opposes the genuine worshippers of God in spirit. In the eyes of God such a person is a dog.<p>The flesh in verse 3 comprises all that we are and have in our natural being. The fact that the Judaizers had confidence in their circumcision was a sign that their confidence was in their flesh. They trusted in their natural qualities and qualifications, not in the Spirit. By contrast Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ, and have no confidence in the flesh.<h2 class=head2>62. Resting upon Them as Glory When They Are Reproached</h2><p>The last aspect of the work of the Spirit in the believers in the third stage is the Spirit&#8217;s resting upon them as glory when they are reproached. First Peter 4:14 says, &#8220;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.&#8221; &#8220;In the name of Christ&#8221; is actually in the person of Christ, in Christ Himself, because the name denotes the person. The believers, having believed into Christ (John 3:15), and having been baptized into His name (Acts 19:5), that is, into Himself (Gal. 3:27), are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and one with Him (1 Cor. 6:17). When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings, in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10).<p>If we are reproached in the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us. Literally, the Greek says &#8220;the Spirit of glory and that of God.&#8221; The Spirit of glory is the Spirit of God. The Spirit of glory is the One through whom Christ was glorified in His resurrection (Rom. 1:4). This Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God Himself, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution for the glorification of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory. The more we suffer and are persecuted, the more glory there will be upon us. This is truly a blessing. Therefore, we should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory is resting upon us.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY-SIX</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(11)</h1><p>We have covered three stages of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers for the divine dispensing: the first stage-from initial sanctification, enlightenment, and regeneration through continual sanctification; the second stage-from transformation through not grieving the Spirit; and the third stage-from the Spirit as the means for the believers to pray through the Spirit resting as glory upon the persecuted believers. The first stage is the initial stage, the second is the inner-life-working stage, and the third is for maintaining our fellowship with the Triune God. Now we come to the fourth and final stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in us. In this stage the work of the Spirit mainly concerns the church with the believers&#8217; gifts, functions, ministries, and work.<h2 class=head2>63. Vindicating the Church as the Manifestation of God in the Flesh</h2><p>The Spirit works in the believers to vindicate the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh. First Timothy 3:16 says, &#8220;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness, who was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the Spirit....&#8221; According to this verse, the Spirit is vindicating the manifestation of God in the flesh. This took place in Christ when He was on earth. He was God manifested in the flesh, and this was vindicated and verified by the Spirit. The same principle applies to the church today. God is manifested in our flesh. But this has to be verified, justified, and vindicated by the all-inclusive Spirit. In the church life we need the Spirit&#8217;s vindicating, verifying, confirming, that what the church does is motivated by the Spirit. This motivation makes the church a present, living manifestation of God in the flesh. Only when we live in the all-inclusive Spirit do we have the vindication that God is manifested in us, the church.<p>The church is a great matter. According to 1 Timothy 3:15, the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth. Paul&#8217;s use of the conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; at the beginning of verse 16 indicates that the church is something even more than the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth. The church is also the mystery of godliness. According to the context, godliness refers not only to piety but to the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out in the church. This is the great mystery confessed universally by believers in Christ. The church as the manifestation of God in the flesh is a mystery, the mystery of godliness. Godliness is God expressed. In the church life we are expressing God, and this expression is vindicated by the Spirit.<p>The mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is also the manifestation of God in the flesh. When a church is well taken care of according to the instructions given in 1 Timothy, with the oversight of the elders and the service of the deacons fully established, the church will function as the house of the living God for His move on earth and as the supporting pillar and holding base of the truth, bearing the divine reality of Christ and His Body as a testimony to the world. Then the church becomes the continuation of Christ&#8217;s manifestation of God in the flesh. This is the great mystery of godliness- Christ lived out of the church as the manifestation of God in the flesh. The Spirit works in the believers to vindicate, verify, confirm, that the church is the manifestation of God in the flesh.<h2 class=head2>64. As the Consummation of the Triune God for Them to Be Baptized into the Divine Trinity</h2><p>Matthew 28:19 says &#8220;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This charge was given by the Lord Jesus after He had entered into resurrection, which was the consummation of the process of the Triune God. The Triune God has passed through a process that began with incarnation, included human living and crucifixion, and consummated with resurrection. In resurrection Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, became the life-giving Spirit. Now this Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God for the believers to be baptized into the divine Trinity.<p>The clearest revelation of the divine Trinity is in Matthew 28:19. On the one hand, this verse speaks of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit; on the other hand, in this verse there is only one name, the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. This is the completion of the process of the Triune God, a process that ends in resurrection. After the completion of this process, the resurrected Christ came to the disciples and charged them to go forth with His authority to disciple the nations and baptize them into the name, the person, of the Triune God that they may have an organic union with the divine Trinity and be brought into the enjoyment of the Trinity for the church life.<p>Baptism is to bring repentant people out of their old state into a new one, by terminating their old life and germinating them with the new life of Christ that they may become members of the Body. After Christ accomplished His ministry on earth, passed through the process of death and resurrection, and became the life-giving Spirit, He charged His disciples to baptize the discipled people into the Triune God. This baptism has two aspects: the visible aspect by water and the invisible aspect by the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38, 41; 10:44-48). The visible aspect is the expression, the testimony, of the invisible aspect, whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect. Without the invisible aspect by the Spirit, the visible aspect by water is vain; and without the visible aspect by water, the invisible aspect by the Spirit is abstract and impractical. Both are needed.<p>The word &#8220;into&#8221; in Matthew 28:19 indicates union, as in Romans 6:3; Galatians 3:27; and 1 Corinthians 12:13. The same Greek word is used in Acts 8:16; 19:3, 5; and 1 Corinthians 1:13, 15. To baptize the believers into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into a spiritual and mystical union with Him.<p>According to Matthew 28:19, there is one name for the Trinity. The name is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize a believer into the name of the Trinity is to immerse him into all that the Triune God is. To be baptized into the person of the Triune God is to be baptized in the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit who is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. This is to be baptized into the riches of the Father, into the riches of the Son, and into the riches of the Spirit. After believing into the Lord Jesus, we were baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Now, as baptized ones, we are in an organic union with the Triune God. Therefore, whatever the Father has, whatever the Son has, and whatever the Spirit receives become ours.<p>In Matthew 28:19 to be baptized is to be baptized into the Triune God. But in Acts to be baptized is to be baptized into the Lord Jesus (Acts 8:16; 19:5). This indicates clearly that the Lord Jesus is the embodiment of the Triune God, the aggregate of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Furthermore, in the Epistles Paul says that to be baptized is to be baptized in the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). Therefore, the New Testament reveals that we are baptized into the Triune God, into the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit. This indicates that the Lord Jesus is the totality of the Triune God and that the Spirit is the realization of the Lord Jesus. We have been baptized in the Spirit, and this is to be baptized into the Lord Jesus, which is to be baptized into the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-the Triune God. As a result, we are one with the Triune God, and whatever He is and has is ours in the organic union with Him. This enjoyment of the divine Trinity through the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is for the church life.<h2 class=head2>65. Coming, Falling, Upon Them as the Power</h2><p>After the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to disciple the nations, bringing them into the Triune God, the all-inclusive Spirit came upon, fell upon, the believers as the power to carry out the Lord&#8217;s commission. The great commission of bringing others into the Triune God requires not only power but also authority. With the Spirit as their power and authority, the believers may command the nations to believe in the Lord Jesus so that they may be brought into the organic union with the Triune God.<p>In Acts 1:8 the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&#8221; To receive power is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit (v. 5) for the fulfillment of the promise of the Father (v. 4). To have the Holy Spirit upon us is different from having the Holy Spirit in us (John 14:17). The Holy Spirit was breathed into the disciples on the day of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection to be the Spirit of life to them essentially. The same Holy Spirit came upon the disciples on the day of Pentecost to be the Spirit of power economically. As for the Spirit of life, we need to breathe Him in as breath. As for the Spirit of power, we need to put Him on as a uniform. These are the two aspects of the one Spirit for our experience (1 Cor. 12:13). The indwelling of the Spirit of life is essential for our life and living; the outpouring of the Spirit of power is economical for our ministry and work.<p>Acts 10:44 says, &#8220;While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those hearing the word.&#8221; In this verse hearing includes believing in the Lord (v. 43; John 5:24; Rom. 10:14; Eph. 1:13). No doubt, the Spirit in Acts 10:44 is the all-inclusive Spirit. When this Spirit fell upon those in the house of Cornelius, they began to speak in tongues and magnify God (v. 46).<p>The Holy Spirit fell upon those who heard the word in the house of Cornelius outwardly and economically. In this case the Holy Spirit&#8217;s entering into the believers essentially for life and falling upon them economically for power took place simultaneously when they believed in the Lord. However, only His falling upon them economically is noted in verse 44, because it was outward and could be realized by others by their speaking in tongues and praising God, whereas His entering into them took place silently and invisibly. They received both aspects of the Holy Spirit directly from Christ the Head of the Body.<p>Acts 10:45 speaks of the outpouring of the gift of the Holy Spirit. This gift was poured out by God from the all-inclusive, resurrected, and ascended Christ. The pouring out of the Spirit after Christ&#8217;s ascension was the descending of the resurrected and ascended Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit to carry out His heavenly ministry on earth to build up His church as His Body.<p>Acts 19:6 says, &#8220;When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.&#8221; Through the laying on of hands Paul identified these believers with the Body of Christ. The Holy Spirit honored this and came upon them, signifying their identification with the Body. According to this verse, the Holy Spirit came upon the believers in Ephesus. The word &#8220;upon&#8221; here is economically different from the essential &#8220;in&#8221; in John 14:17. &#8220;In&#8221; is related to the intrinsic essence for life; &#8220;upon&#8221; is related to the outward element for power. Here the Ephesian believers received the Holy Spirit upon them outwardly as power.<h2 class=head2>66. Filling Them Outwardly</h2><p>After the Spirit descended upon the believers, He filled them outwardly. Acts 2:4 says, &#8220;They were all filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;filled&#8221; in this verse is pletho (also used in 4:8, 31; 9:17; 13:9; and Luke 1:15, 41, 67). This Greek word means to fill outwardly. In Acts 2:2 a rushing violent wind filled the house where the disciples were sitting. In this verse another Greek word for &#8220;filled&#8221; is used-pleroo. This Greek word denotes an inner filling, to fill something within. According to its usage in Acts, pleroo denotes to fill a vessel within, as the wind filled the house inwardly, and pletho denotes to fill persons outwardly, as the Spirit filled the disciples outwardly in Acts 2:4. The disciples were filled (pleroo) inwardly and essentially with the Spirit (13:52) for their Christian living, and they were filled (pletho) outwardly and economically with the Spirit for their Christian ministry. The inward filling Spirit, the essential Spirit, is in the believers (John 14:17; Rom. 8:11), whereas the outward filling Spirit, the economical Spirit, is upon them (Acts 1:8; 2:17). Every believer in Christ should experience both aspects of the Holy Spirit.<p>Acts 4:8 says that Peter again was &#8220;filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Here Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly and economically. On the day of Pentecost Peter was outwardly filled with the Spirit the first time. That was his initial experience of the outward filling of the Spirit. Acts 4:8 describes another experience of such a filling. This does not mean that Peter was baptized in the Spirit twice. Rather, this indicates that he applied the experience of the baptism in the Spirit a second time, being filled with the Spirit outwardly and economically to speak the word.<p>According to Acts 4:29-31, Peter and the other believers prayed for boldness to speak the Lord&#8217;s word. &#8220;As they were beseeching, the place in which they were gathered was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God with boldness&#8221; (v. 31). Like Peter in verse 8, they were filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly and economically. Peter and his company were filled (pletho) again with the Holy Spirit and spoke the word of God with boldness. This was not the third time for Peter to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. On the contrary, it was the third time for Him to experience the baptism in the Spirit by being outwardly filled with the Spirit. Furthermore, Acts 4:31 does not say that the believers were filled with the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues. Instead, this verse says that the disciples, being outwardly filled with the Spirit, spoke the word of God with boldness.<p>The book of Acts also describes Paul&#8217;s experience of being filled with the Spirit outwardly. In Acts 9:17 Ananias said to him, &#8220;The Lord has sent me, Jesus, who appeared to you on the road by which you came, so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; This filling is the outward filling with the economical Spirit. According to the principle of salvation in God&#8217;s New Testament economy, Paul must have received the Holy Spirit of life essentially at the time of His conversion, prior to Ananias&#8217; coming and laying his hands on him. Before Ananias came, he was praying to the Lord (Acts 9:11), indicating he had believed in the Lord and was calling on Him. But because he was not saved through a member of the Body, the Holy Spirit did not fall upon him economically until Ananias came, as the representative of the Body, to identify him with the Body of Christ. Therefore, in Acts 9:17, after his conversion, Paul experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit and was filled outwardly with the Spirit. He had the same experience again when he was filled (pletho) with the Holy Spirit in his ministry.<p>Acts 13:9 says that Paul was &#8220;filled with the Holy Spirit.&#8221; According to the record of Acts, this was the second time Paul was filled outwardly and economically with the Holy Spirit for power in his ministry.<h2 class=head2>67. Being the Element for the Apostles to Be the Sufficient Ministers of the New Covenant</h2><p>The all-inclusive, consummated Spirit is the element, the divine essence, for the apostles to be the sufficient ministers of the new covenant (2 Cor. 3:6). This means that the apostles became ministers of the new covenant not by human knowledge or natural effort but by the Spirit as the constituting element. All the apostles were constituted of the all-inclusive Spirit as their element so that they could be spiritual ministers of the spiritual new covenant. Instead of studying theology in a school, the apostles were constituted of the all-inclusive Spirit. Therefore, there was a real spiritual constitution within them, and this constitution was of the Spirit and with the Spirit as the element of the new covenant. As a result, the apostles became servants of the new covenant to minister this covenant not by knowledge but by the constitution of the all-inclusive Spirit.<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:4 and 5 Paul says, &#8220;Such confidence we have through Christ toward God. Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to account anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.&#8221; Here we see that the living God Himself is the sufficiency, competency, and qualification of the apostles&#8217; ministry for God&#8217;s New Testament economy to dispense Christ into God&#8217;s chosen people for the building up of Christ&#8217;s Body. We ourselves are of no account, and what we can do is likewise of no account. Only the Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit constituted into us is sufficient to carry on the ministry of the new covenant.<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:6 Paul, speaking of God, goes on to say, &#8220;Who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.&#8221; The Greek word rendered &#8220;made&#8221; also means enabled, qualified, made competent. The phrase &#8220;not of letter&#8221; modifies ministers; it does not modify covenant. By &#8220;letter&#8221; here Paul means the written code of the law. The Spirit is the Spirit of the living God, with whom the apostle ministers Christ into the believers. The apostolic ministry for the New Testament is not of dead letters like the Mosaic ministry for the Old Testament, but of the living Spirit, who gives life.<p>In verse 6 Paul tells us that the letter kills but the Spirit gives life. The letter which kills is the letter of the law, which only requires of man but is unable to supply man with life (Gal. 3:21). Due to man&#8217;s inability to fulfill its requirements, it kills man (Rom. 7:9-11). The Spirit, who is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the apostles and all other believers, making them ministers of a new covenant, the covenant of life. Hence, their ministry is one constituted of the Triune God of life by His life-giving Spirit.<p>The Spirit who works in the believers is the Spirit of the new covenant ministry that gives life. Within life there are many elements. The Spirit not only transforms us but also constitutes the New Testament ministry. Hence, the New Testament ministry is one with the transforming Spirit, and this ministry is a transforming ministry. Paul&#8217;s ministry was constituted of and with the transforming Spirit. When Paul was ministering, the transforming Spirit was working in the saints. Today, when we listen to a person whose speaking is the New Testament ministry, the Spirit works in us to transform us as the divine element is being dispensed into our being by the Spirit. This is the Spirit as the element that makes us sufficient ministers of the new covenant.<p>We should not think that only the apostles are sufficient as ministers of the new covenant. We all are ministering ones, and God has made us competent to minister. God has made us competent ministers not of a covenant of letters but of a covenant of the Spirit. Therefore, whatever we preach or teach should be a word constituted of the Spirit.<p>We all need to have, and we all can have, a share in the New Testament ministry. Even the youngest among us may have such a ministry. In order to have this ministry, we need to have the experience of being constituted of the living Spirit. Then we shall be ministers not of letter, doctrine, or theology; instead, we shall be ministers of the living Spirit. This is a matter of the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity.<h2 class=head2>68. Being the Element of the Ministry of the New Testament</h2><p>Not only is the Spirit the element for the apostles to be the sufficient ministers of the new covenant, but the Spirit is the element of the ministry of the New Testament itself. This means that both the ministers and the ministry are a constitution of the all-inclusive Spirit. Those who want to be co-workers in the recovery today must be constituted of the Spirit with the divine life and the spiritual truths. No one should try to do a work without being constituted in this way. The Lord&#8217;s new covenant needs ministry, not work, and ministry is a constitution of the Holy Spirit with the divine life and truths. If we have such a constitution, then wherever we are, our being will be the ministry. Therefore, the way to carry out the Lord&#8217;s recovery is not by trying to do a work but by having a spiritual constitution, a constitution of the Spirit with the divine life and the divine truths in a dedicated person. Eventually, such a dedicated person will become a living constitution of the new covenant. Such a constitution is what makes us sufficient, competent ministers of the new covenant. This constitution is desperately needed among us in the Lord&#8217;s recovery today.<p>We should not think that ministry is simply a matter of our work or preaching or teaching. Ministry is a matter of spiritual constitution. Any believer, brother or sister, who is constituted of the Spirit will be successful in the Christian life personally and in the Lord&#8217;s recovery corporately. Those who intend to participate in the work of the recovery need a thorough understanding of this. It is the spiritual constitution that makes us sufficient, competent, as ministers of the new covenant, for our ministry is a constitution of the Spirit with the divine life and the truth. Hence, we need to experience the divine life and know the divine truth. Life and truth are the materials used by the Holy Spirit to constitute us. If we realize this, we shall see that the Lord&#8217;s recovery will not receive anything that is merely a work or an activity. On the contrary, we can receive only the constitution of the Spirit with the divine life and the divine truths. To work, to minister, for the new covenant does not require that we simply learn how to act, move, and carry on a Christian work. Rather, the ministry of the New Testament requires that, as dedicated ones who love the Lord Jesus to the uttermost, we become constituted of the Spirit with the divine life and truths. Then, as those who have the constitution of the new covenant, wherever we go we shall be ministers of the all-inclusive Christ in His resurrection and ascension.<p>In the book of 2 Corinthians, especially in chapter three, the ministry of the New Testament is strongly emphasized. In 2 Corinthians 3:8 Paul speaks of &#8220;the ministry of the Spirit.&#8221; This is the apostolic ministry of the new covenant, a covenant of the living Spirit, who gives life.<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:7 and 8 Paul presents a strong contrast between the ministry of death and the ministry of the Spirit. Most of us would not contrast death with the Spirit, for death is always versus life. For us, the issue is a matter of life or death, death or life. Thus, we would expect Paul to speak not of the ministry of the Spirit but of the ministry of life. However, instead of using the word &#8220;life&#8221; in verse 8, Paul speaks of the Spirit. This indicates that the Spirit here is related to life, since life is what stands in contrast to death. In verse 6 Paul says that the Spirit gives life. Therefore, the Spirit in verse 8 points to the Spirit who gives life and also to the life given by the Spirit. The Old Testament ministry was a ministry of death; the New Testament ministry is a ministry of life embodied in the Spirit. The essence of the Spirit dispensed into us is life.<p>The reason Paul in 3:8 speaks of the ministry of the Spirit and not of the ministry of life is that the Spirit is the source, element, and sphere of life. Without the Spirit there is no source of life. Neither is there the element or sphere of life. Therefore, to speak here of the ministry of life would be to say much less than to speak of the ministry of the Spirit. Paul chose the best expression, and instead of comparing death with life, he compared death with the Spirit. If we realize that the Spirit here is of life, we shall understand the nature of the essence of which we are constituted for the New Testament ministry. In every aspect and in every way the New Testament ministry dispenses Christ into us as the life-giving Spirit. The Spirit is truly the element of the ministry of the New Testament.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(12)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover more aspects of the fourth stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers for the divine dispensing. This stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work is related to the church and includes the believers&#8217; gifts, functions, and ministries.<h2 class=head2>69. Giving Them the Utterance to Speak in Different Tongues</h2><p>On the day of Pentecost the Spirit gave the believers utterance to speak in different tongues. Acts 2:3 and 4 say, &#8220;There appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were divided and sat on each one of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave them to speak out.&#8221; The tongues of fire in verse 3 are a symbol of speaking, symbolizing that God&#8217;s economical Spirit of power is mostly for speaking. He is the speaking Spirit. In verse 4 &#8220;all&#8221; modifies only &#8220;filled&#8221; in the first clause, not &#8220;began to speak&#8221; in the second clause. The word &#8220;all&#8221; cannot be used as evidence that all the believers who were filled with the Holy Spirit began to speak in tongues.<p>According to grammar, verse 4 is not saying that all were filled with the Holy Spirit and that all began to speak in different tongues. The comma after &#8220;Holy Spirit&#8221; may help us to see that &#8220;all&#8221; does not modify both &#8220;filled&#8221; and &#8220;began to speak.&#8221; &#8220;All&#8221; modifies only the first predicate, not the second, indicating that all were filled with the Holy Spirit but not all spoke in tongues. If Luke&#8217;s meaning is that all spoke in tongues, he should have used the word &#8220;all&#8221; a second time, before the word &#8220;began.&#8221; This verse indicates that although all were filled with the Holy Spirit, not all spoke in tongues.<p>The tongues spoken in Acts 2:4 were dialects (vv. 6, 8). The disciples were Galileans (v. 7), yet they spoke the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from different parts of the world. This is strong proof that tongue-speaking must be an understandable language, not merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue.<p>The word &#8220;dialect&#8221; in verses 6 and 8 is synonymous with &#8220;tongues&#8221; in verse 4. According to verse 11, the people exclaimed, &#8220;We hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.&#8221; The Greek word for &#8220;tongues&#8221; here, as in verse 4, is glossa. In this chapter glossa is used for both the speaking organ (v. 3) and dialects (vv. 4, 11), referring to the dialects in verses 6 and 8. This indicates that tongue-speaking must be a dialect, because what the disciples spoke in tongues were all different dialects. In this sense, tongues and dialects are synonymous, inter-changeably used in these verses. On the day of Pentecost the Spirit gave the believers utterance to speak in different tongues, which were genuine human dialects, and with these tongues they uttered the things concerning Christ in His ascension with His resurrection.<h2 class=head2>70. Witnessing of the Resurrected and Exalted Christ</h2><p>The Spirit in the believers also witnesses of the resurrected and exalted Christ. Acts 5:32 says, &#8220;We are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also.&#8221; As the context indicates, &#8220;these things&#8221; refer to the resurrection and exaltation of Christ. Verse 30 says, &#8220;The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you slew, hanging Him on a tree.&#8221; Here we see Christ&#8217;s resurrection. Verse 31 continues, &#8220;This One God has exalted to His right hand.&#8221; Here we have Christ&#8217;s exaltation. The Spirit, therefore, witnesses of the resurrected and exalted Christ, giving utterance to the believers to speak concerning Christ in His resurrection and exaltation. Both the apostles and the Holy Spirit were witnesses of these things. This indicates that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles. Today we, through the all-inclusive Spirit, need to preach the deep things concerning Christ in His resurrection and exaltation.<h2 class=head2>71. As the Power for the Apostles to Preach the Gospel of Christ to the Nations</h2><p>The Spirit is the power for the apostles to preach the gospel of Christ to the nations. Paul says, &#8220;I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not accomplished by me unto the obedience of the nations, by word and work, in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit; so that from Jerusalem and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ&#8221; (Rom. 15:18-19). During Paul&#8217;s time, Illyricum was a remote region on the northeastern corner of Europe. Paul preached the gospel from Jerusalem, a cultured city, to a remote, uncultured region. Through the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit as power Paul preached the gospel to the nations in a prevailing way. In his preaching to the nations he ministered Christ as the sanctifying element that can change a person&#8217;s being. As a result of such gospel preaching, the nations became an acceptable offering, an offering sanctified by the Holy Spirit (v. 16).<h2 class=head2>72. With the Power Being Demonstrated in the Apostles&#8217; Preaching</h2><p>When the apostles preached the gospel, they did so in the demonstration of the Spirit and of power. In 1 Corinthians 2:4 Paul says, &#8220;My speech and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.&#8221; Persuasive words of wisdom issue from the human mind; demonstration of the Spirit comes from our spirit. Paul&#8217;s speech and preaching were not from his mind with words of speculation but from his spirit with the release and exhibition of the Spirit, hence of power. Paul did not exercise persuasive words of wisdom but the demonstration of the Spirit and of power. The power demonstrated by Paul was Christ crucified (1 Cor. 1:23-24). The issue of such a demonstration was that the believers&#8217; faith would not be the result of Paul&#8217;s wisdom overcoming their wisdom, but would be in God&#8217;s power, the crucified Christ (1 Cor. 2:5).<p>First Thessalonians 1:5 says, &#8220;Our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as you know what kind of men we were among you for your sake.&#8221; Here we see that the gospel preached by the apostles was preached not only in word but also in power and in the Holy Spirit. The Spirit was the reality of the gospel preached by the apostles. Verse 6 tells us that the believers accepted the gospel with joy of the Holy Spirit. The gospel was in the Spirit, and the joy with which the believers accepted the gospel was of the Holy Spirit. On the preachers&#8217; side the gospel was in the Spirit, and on the receivers&#8217; side the joy was of the Spirit. If there had been no Spirit, there would have been no reality of the gospel and no genuine joy to receive the gospel.<p>First Thessalonians 1:5 indicates that the apostles not only preached the gospel; they lived it. Their ministering of the gospel was not only by word but also by a life that displays the power of God, a life in the Holy Spirit and in the assurance of their faith. They were the model of the glad tidings they spread. We all should learn to preach the gospel in power, in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance. If we would preach the gospel in this way, we must have a life to match this kind of gospel preaching. Our manner of life must match the power, the Holy Spirit, and the assurance.<h2 class=head2>73. As the Means for Them to Speak for Christ</h2><p>In 1 Corinthians 12:3 we see that the Spirit is the means for the believers to speak for Christ: &#8220;I make known to you that no one speaking in the Spirit of God says, Jesus is accursed; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit.&#8221; Unless we are in the Spirit, we cannot speak for Christ. The Spirit is the element, the sphere, and the means for us to speak for Christ.<p>In Paul&#8217;s word in 1 Corinthians 12:3 we see the governing principle of the spiritual gifts (v. 1). Paul&#8217;s concept is that the dumb, voiceless idols in verse 2 make their worshippers dumb and voiceless, but the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit. This kind of speaking is related to the spiritual gifts. No one who speaks in the Spirit of God would say, &#8220;Jesus is accursed&#8221;; he would like to say and he is able to say, &#8220;Lord Jesus.&#8221; No worshippers of God should be silent; instead, all should use their voices to speak forth the Lord Jesus in the Spirit of God. This-to speak the Lord Jesus-is the main function of all the spiritual gifts.<p>The governing principle of the gifts is to speak by our spirit with the Spirit, that is, to utter something with the Spirit in our spirit. This kind of speaking is centered on the Lord Jesus. Therefore, what we speak should be focused on Christ. Christ should be the substance, the element, the essence, of our speaking. We all should speak for the Lord and even speak forth the Lord. We need to speak things that are centered on Christ. Furthermore, Christ must even be our speaking, our utterance. He must be the center and circumference of our speech. To speak Christ in this way is a strong proof that we are living. Because the God whom we worship is the living and speaking God, we also speak and thereby prove that we are living members of the Body of Christ.<p>Paul&#8217;s intention in 1 Corinthians 12:1-3 is to impress us with the importance of speaking in the Spirit. When we speak Christ in the Spirit, the Spirit will function for the dispensing of the Triune God into ourselves and others.<h2 class=head2>74. Giving Them Direction</h2><p>The book of Acts reveals that the Spirit gives direction to the believers. For example, Philip&#8217;s activity in preaching the gospel was under the direction, leading, and guidance of the Holy Spirit. In 8:29 &#8220;the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.&#8221; Later, &#8220;the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip&#8221; (v. 39). This indicates that the Lord&#8217;s move in spreading His kingdom through the preaching of the gospel in Acts was by the Spirit&#8217;s leading and direction, not by man&#8217;s device and schedule. Hence, it was not the act of man but of the Spirit. We should learn from this pattern to pray and keep ourselves in fellowship with the Lord that we may sense His leading at any time. Then our move and our preaching of the gospel will be according to the Spirit&#8217;s direction. We need to follow the Spirit&#8217;s direction, not our own opinion, plan, and schedule. All our activity in preaching the gospel should be under the direction and guidance of the Spirit.<p>In Acts 10 Peter was directed by the Spirit in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles. &#8220;While Peter was pondering concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are seeking you. But rise up and go down and go with them, doubting nothing, because I have sent them&#8221; (vv. 19-20). This indicates that Cornelius&#8217; sending of the three men (vv. 7-8) was the Spirit&#8217;s move and act through him. In 8:29 the Spirit spoke to Philip, and in 10:19 the Spirit spoke to Peter.<p>In 13:2 the prophets and teachers in Antioch experienced the direction of the Spirit in separating Barnabas and Saul for the work: &#8220;As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.&#8221; These prophets and teachers were not conferring and organizing; rather, they were ministering to the Lord and fasting. As they were ministering in this way, He as the Spirit came in and spoke to them, saying, &#8220;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul.&#8221; This indicates that here the Holy Spirit is the Lord.<p>However, we may think that the Spirit is separate from the Lord. Some even say that the Spirit is the agent or representative of the Lord. If the Spirit is merely the Lord&#8217;s representative, then in 13:2 the Holy Spirit should not have said, &#8220;Set apart for Me.&#8221; Instead, the Spirit should have said, &#8220;I, the Spirit, am an agent of the Lord. I represent the Lord and work for Him. Therefore, I tell you to separate Barnabas and Saul not unto Me but for the Lord, for whom I am working.&#8221;<p>In 13:2 we have the Lord, the Holy Spirit, and &#8220;Me.&#8221; Surely the Me in this verse is the Lord. Hence, the Spirit could tell them to separate Barnabas and Saul &#8220;for Me.&#8221; This Me is both the Lord and the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we should not think that the Holy Spirit is separate from the Lord. No, the Holy Spirit is the Lord to whom we minister. When we minister, we minister to the Lord. But when the Lord responds to us, He responds as the Holy Spirit. Because He is the Lord, He could say as the Holy Spirit, &#8220;Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul.&#8221;<p>In 13:2 the Holy Spirit as the pneumatic Christ, the Head of the Body, told the five to set apart Barnabas and Saul for the work to which He had called them. This was a giant step taken by the Lord for the spread of the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world. It was initiated by five faithful and seeking members of the Body who provided an opportunity, through their ministering and fasting, to the Head of the Body that He, as the Spirit, might set some apart to carry out His great commission to spread His kingdom for the establishment of His church in the Gentile world through the preaching of His gospel. This major step was absolutely a move by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit through the coordination of the faithful and seeking members of the Body on earth with the Head in the heavens.<p>In 21:4 the disciples in Tyre &#8220;told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.&#8221; This was a direct guidance of the Spirit given to Paul through certain disciples. Here the Spirit told Paul, through some members of the Body, not to go to Jerusalem. In practicing the Body life, Paul should have taken this word and obeyed it as a word from the Head.<p>All these cases show that in Acts the believers were living, moving, working, traveling, and doing everything by the direction of the Spirit. Outwardly they were filled with the Spirit of power economically for them to carry out the work of God&#8217;s New Testament economy, and inwardly they were filled with the Spirit of life essentially for them to live a life of the processed Triune God. As a result, they moved, walked, worked, acted, traveled, and did everything by the Spirit as men of the Spirit. These are the members of the Body of Christ living and moving on earth for the testimony of the resurrected and exalted Christ and the fulfillment of God&#8217;s plan according to His eternal economy.<h2 class=head2>75. As the Means for Them to Prophesy</h2><p>The Spirit is also the means for the believers to prophesy. Acts 11:28 says, &#8220;One of them named Agabus rose up and signified through the Spirit that there was about to be a great famine over the whole inhabited earth, which occurred at the time of Claudius.&#8221; To prophesy, according to the biblical sense, is not mainly to predict but to speak for God and to speak forth God. This is the main significance of the word &#8220;prophesy&#8221; in 1 Corinthians 14. To prophesy, to speak for God and to speak forth God, must be to utter something by the Spirit of God as the means. If we speak something for God and try to speak forth God without the Spirit of God, that is, in ordinary human speaking, that is not prophesying. To prophesy, either to predict something for God or to speak for God and speak forth God, must be a speaking by the Spirit of God.<h2 class=head2>76. Telling Them the Things to Come</h2><p>According to Acts, the Spirit tells the believers the things to come. Acts 20:22-23 says, &#8220;Now, behold, I am going bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what I will meet with there, except that the Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in city after city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.&#8221; Paul did not know what he would meet with in Jerusalem, but he knew one thing-that the Holy Spirit solemnly testified to him that bonds and afflictions awaited him. The Holy Spirit&#8217;s testifying was a prophecy, a foretelling, not a charge. Hence, Paul should not have taken this as a command but as a warning.<p>Another instance of the Spirit&#8217;s telling the believers the things to come is in Acts 21:11. Agabus &#8220;took Paul&#8217;s girdle; and having bound his own feet and hands, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, In this way shall the Jews in Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.&#8221; Here the Holy Spirit told Paul again, not directly but through a member of the Body, what would befall him in Jerusalem. This also was a warning in the nature of a prophecy, not a charge. It was again the Spirit speaking through the Body. In the practice of the Body life, Paul should have listened to this speaking.<p>In 1 Timothy 4:1 Paul says, &#8220;The Spirit says expressly that in later times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons.&#8221; Here the Spirit tells the believers of the coming apostasy and warns them concerning it. This is the Spirit who dwells in our spirit and speaks to us there (Rom. 8:9-11, 16). We need to exercise our spirit that it may become keen and clear to listen to the Spirit&#8217;s speaking and be kept from the deceiving spirits and the teachings of demons.<p>According to the principle of incarnation-the principle that divinity is brought into humanity and works with humanity-1 Timothy 4:1 implies our spirit. When the Spirit speaks, He speaks within our spirit, through our spirit, and out from our spirit. If there were no one who was truly one spirit with the speaking God (1 Cor. 6:17), there would be no way, according to the New Testament principle, for the Spirit to speak. The speaking of the Spirit in 4:1 is according to the way of incarnation. This means that the Spirit spoke from within Paul&#8217;s spirit.<p>If we would hear the speaking of the Spirit, we need to exercise our spirit. Only our spirit can listen to the speaking of the Spirit. The mind is not qualified for this. The Spirit speaks to our spirit, and our spirit responds to the Spirit. Therefore, we need to exercise our spirit to listen to the speaking of the Spirit from within the spirit of the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 4:1.<h2 class=head2>77. Sending Them Out to Spread the Gospel</h2><p>In Acts 13 the Spirit sent out Barnabas and Saul to preach the gospel. In verse 3 Barnabas and Saul were sent out by the other three: &#8220;When they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.&#8221; Here the laying on of hands denotes identification, signifying that they who laid their hands were one with those on whom they laid their hands. By this they declared to all that they were one with the sent ones in their going to carry out the Lord&#8217;s great commission.<p>Speaking of Barnabas and Saul, verse 4 goes on to say, &#8220;They therefore, having been sent out by the Holy Spirit.&#8221; In verse 3 Barnabas and Saul were sent by the other three, but here we are told that they were sent out by the Spirit. This proves that the three were one with the Spirit in the Lord&#8217;s move, and the Spirit honored their sending as His.<h2 class=head2>78. Working Together with the Apostles and Elders to Resolve the Problem of Keeping the Law</h2><p>In Acts 15 the Spirit worked together with the apostles and elders to solve the problem of keeping the law. There had been a great disturbance regarding the keeping of the Mosaic law and the ceremony of circumcision. Eventually, by the Spirit working together with the apostles and elders at a conference in Jerusalem this problem was solved.<p>In Acts 15 we have the unique conference held by the apostles of the universal church and the elders of the local church in Jerusalem. Both were the leading ones in the Lord&#8217;s New Testament move on earth. There was no chairman. This conference was under the presiding of the Spirit (v. 28), the pneumatic Christ, the Head of the church (Col. 1:18) and the Lord of all (Acts 10:36).<p>Some may think that this conference was the first church council. This is a mistaken understanding. Here we do not have a council but a gathering for fellowship, with the Holy Spirit as the One presiding. Therefore, verse 28 says, &#8220;It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things.&#8221; There was no voting, and there was neither autocracy nor democracy, neither of which should exist in the church life. Instead, in the church life there should simply be fellowship in the Spirit. Acts 15 is a record of this kind of fellowship.<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE NINETY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class=title>THE SPIRIT-HIS WORK</h1><h1 class=msg>(13)</h1><p>In this message we shall cover the remaining aspects of the fourth stage of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers for the divine dispensing.<h2 class=head2>79. Guiding the Apostles by Forbidding Them and Not Allowing Them</h2><p>In Acts 16:6 and 7 we see that the Spirit guided the apostles by forbidding them and not allowing them. &#8220;They passed through the country of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia&#8221; (v. 6). The move of the Apostle Paul and his co-workers for the spread of the gospel was not according to their decision and preference, nor according to any schedule made by human council, but by the Holy Spirit according to God&#8217;s counsel, as in the mission of Philip (Acts 8:29, 39). They intended to speak the word in Asia, but the Holy Spirit forbade them. Forbidding is also a part of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s leading.<p>Acts 16:7 continues, &#8220;When they had come down to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.&#8221; The Holy Spirit&#8217;s forbidding and the Spirit of Jesus&#8217; not allowing indicated that Paul and his co-workers should go directly forward, in a direction that was toward eastern Europe, in particular, toward Macedonia and Achaia. Paul, however, did not have the thought of going there. This made it necessary for the Lord to give him a vision during the night, and in this vision a Macedonian call came to Paul (v. 9).<p>The interchangeable use of the Spirit of Jesus with the Holy Spirit reveals that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament. The Spirit of Jesus is a special term, a particular expression, concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross. This indicates that in the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death. Therefore, the Spirit of Jesus involves more than the Holy Spirit does. The Holy Spirit involves the incarnation and birth of the Lord Jesus, but the Spirit of Jesus involves His humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. Because the Spirit of Jesus possesses humanity, He could guide the apostles, who were carrying out in their humanity the propagation of the resurrected and ascended Christ.<p>In Acts 16 we see that the move of the apostles in their evangelistic work was strictly speaking not by the Spirit of God. Rather, it was by the Holy Spirit, who was involved with the Lord&#8217;s incarnation and birth, and by the Spirit of Jesus, who was involved with the Lord&#8217;s humanity, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. These titles of the Spirit indicate that Paul&#8217;s move in His evangelical work was not in the way of the old dispensation. If it had been a move in the old dispensation, then the Spirit of God or the Spirit of Jehovah should have been mentioned. But in Acts 16 there is no mention either of the Spirit of God or of the Spirit of Jehovah. The fact that Luke speaks of the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus indicates that the evangelical work of the apostles was a new move in God&#8217;s New Testament economy.<p>The kind of work we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted. The all-inclusive Spirit should become our constitution, and then our work will be the expression of this Spirit. As a vessel containing the Triune God, Paul was fully constituted of the Holy Spirit and of the Spirit of Jesus. As a person constituted of the all-inclusive Spirit, he could truly preach Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head2>80. Establishing the Elders in the Churches</h2><p>The Spirit also establishes the elders in the churches. In Acts 20:28 Paul tells the elders of the church in Ephesus that the Holy Spirit had placed them among the flock as overseers. It was the apostles who had appointed the elders in every church (Acts 14:23). But here Paul, the leading one, who did the appointing says that the Holy Spirit had placed the elders as overseers to shepherd the church. This indicates that the Holy Spirit was one with the apostles in their appointing the elders and that the apostles had done this according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. This indicates that those who establish the elders in the churches must do so by following the indwelling Spirit in their spirit. In this way the arrangement of the eldership will be according to the leading and directing of the Holy Spirit.<p>From Paul&#8217;s word concerning the Holy Spirit placing overseers among the flock we see that the existence of the churches is altogether due to the Holy Spirit, not due to the apostles. Although the apostles had appointed the elders, Paul says that this was the work of the Holy Spirit. This reveals that a church comes into existence only through the work of the Holy Spirit. In other words, the work of the apostles concerning the churches should be absolutely the work of the Holy Spirit. Because the Holy Spirit establishes the elders, it is the Holy Spirit who establishes the churches.<h2 class=head2>81. Distributing Gifts to the Members of the Body of Christ</h2><p>The Spirit works in the believers to distribute gifts to them as members of the Body of Christ. First Corinthians 12:4 says, &#8220;But there are distributions of gifts, but the same Spirit.&#8221; &#8220;But&#8221; here indicates a contrast between verses 3 and 4. Verse 3 says that when we minister by speaking in the Spirit of God, we all say, &#8220;Lord Jesus,&#8221; exalting Jesus as the Lord. But there are differences in the gifts for the manifestation of the Spirit; there are diversities in these gifts. The Greek word rendered &#8220;distributions&#8221; in verse 4, as well as in verses 5 and 6, can also be translated diversities, varieties, distinctions.<p>The gifts in 1 Corinthians 12:4 refer to the outward gifts, the abilities or enablings for service. Some of them are miraculous, and some are developed out of the initial gifts mentioned in 1:7. In 1:7 &#8220;gift&#8221; refers to the inward gifts issuing from grace, such as the free gift of eternal life (Rom. 6:23) and the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38) as the heavenly gift (Heb. 6:4), not the outward, miraculous gifts. All the gifts in chapter twelve are different from the initial gifts.<p>Hebrews 2:4 speaks of distributions of the Holy Spirit. The distributions of the Holy Spirit are the things, including the Spirit Himself, which the Holy Spirit distributes to those who receive salvation by believing in Christ. This also includes the imparting of the divine life into the believers. All of us who have believed in the Lord Jesus need to realize that the divine life has been distributed into our being with the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. This is the first basic distribution of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit Himself is a distribution into us. In our experience there are also other distributions of the Holy Spirit.<p>In order for the church to be built up, there is the need for all the saints to exercise the spiritual gifts in the church meetings, in the big meetings and especially in the home meetings. If we meet without the exercise of the spiritual gifts, our meeting will simply be a social gathering, not a proper church meeting. Today many Christian meetings are in the nature of a social gathering because of the lack of spiritual gifts. This means that most Christians have lost their spiritual function. Few saints come to the meetings with the concept of exercising their gifts.<p>No believer should think that he does not have a spiritual gift. Just as we have gifts because we have human life, we also have spiritual gifts because we have the divine life. With the divine life there are certain gifts, certain abilities. According to our experience and observation, the first such gift or ability is speaking. Our God is a speaking God, and His life is a speaking life. Therefore, it is altogether contrary to the spiritual law for a Christian not to speak. We need to use our speaking ability, our speaking gift. If we learn to speak spiritually, our gifts will be developed and increased. In all meetings, large or small, we need to exercise our spiritual gifts for the building up of the church. It is for this purpose that the Spirit distributes different gifts to the members of the Body of Christ.<h2 class=head2>82. Manifesting Himself in Each One of the Members of the Body of Christ through Different Gifts</h2><p>The Spirit manifests Himself in each one of the members of the Body of Christ through different gifts (1 Cor. 12:7-11). In verse 7 Paul says, &#8220;To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit.&#8221; All the different gifts are the manifestation of the Spirit; that is, the Spirit is manifested in the believers who have received the gifts. Such manifestation of the Spirit is for the profit of the church, the Body of Christ. &#8220;For profit&#8221; in verse 7 means for the growth in life of the members of the Body of Christ and for the building up of Christ&#8217;s Body.<p>In verses 8 through 10 Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit. Verse 8 says, &#8220;To one through the Spirit is given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit.&#8221; According to the context of this book, the word of wisdom is the word concerning Christ as the deeper things of God predestined by God for our portion (1:24, 30; 2:6-10). The word of knowledge is the word that imparts a general knowledge of things concerning God and the Lord (8:1-7). The word of wisdom is mainly of our spirit through revelation; the word of knowledge is mainly of our understanding through teaching. The former is deeper than the latter. However, these two, not the speaking in tongues nor any other miraculous gift, are listed as the first gifts and topmost manifestation of the Spirit because these two are the most profitable ministries or services for the edification of the saints and the building up of the church to carry out God&#8217;s operation.<p>After the first two gifts, the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge, Paul mentions certain miraculous gifts. &#8220;To a different one faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing in the one Spirit&#8221; (v. 9). Faith here is like the faith that can remove mountains, as mentioned in 13:2 and Mark 11:22-24. The gift of healing in verse 9 is the miraculous power for healing different diseases.<p>In verse 10 we have yet another miraculous gift-&#8220;operations of works of power.&#8221; This refers to miracles, works of miraculous power other than healing. An example would be the case of Peter raising Dorcas from death (Acts 9:36-42).<p>In verse 10 Paul also mentions prophecy. This is to speak for God and to speak forth God, including foretelling, predicting. We should not understand the word &#8220;prophecy&#8221; here as primarily meaning to predict. It mainly means to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. Of course, it sometimes includes an element of prediction, of speaking for, speaking forth, and speaking beforehand. Foretelling is miraculous, but speaking for God and speaking forth God are not miraculous.<p>Paul also tells us in verse 10 that to another is given the discerning of spirits. This is to distinguish the Spirit that is of God from those that are not of God (1 Tim. 4:1; 1 John 4:1-3). This requires maturity in life.<p>Paul concludes verse 10 by saying, &#8220;To a different one various kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.&#8221; Tongues here are a proper language or dialect (Acts 2:4, 6, 8, 11) either of men or of angels (1 Cor. 13:1), not meaningless voices or sounds. The genuine and proper speaking in tongues is one of the many gifts of the Spirit, one of the many aspects of the manifestation of the Spirit. Some say that speaking in tongues is first the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit, but it afterward becomes a gift of the Spirit. According to this understanding, as the initial evidence every believer must have the gift of tongues, but as a gift of the Spirit every believer does not necessarily have it. However, this kind of teaching is groundless in the New Testament. The New Testament makes it more than clear that speaking in tongues is only one of the many gifts of the Spirit, and not all believers have it.<p>The interpretation of tongues is the gift to make the unknown tongues known, understandable (14:13). This is the ninth item of the manifestation of the Spirit listed in this chapter.<p>Although Paul lists nine manifestations of the Spirit, the manifestation of the Spirit by the believers is more than nine items. The apostleship, helps, and administrations by the Spirit listed in 12:28, seeing visions and dreaming dreams by the Spirit as mentioned in Acts 2:17, the signs and wonders referred to in Hebrews 2:4, and three of the five miraculous acts prophesied in Mark 16:17-18 are not listed here. Paul listed only nine items of the Spirit&#8217;s manifestation as an illustration. Of these nine, speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues are listed as the last two, because they are not as profitable as the other items for the building up of the church (1 Cor. 14:2-6, 18, 19). Of these nine gifts and those listed in 12:28-30, prophecy as prediction, faith, gifts of healing, works of power, speaking in tongues, and interpretation of tongues are miraculous. All the rest, a word of wisdom (like the word of the apostles), a word of knowledge (like the word of the teachers), and speaking for God and speaking forth God in prophecy by the prophets, discerning of spirits, helps, and administrations are gifts developed by the growth in life (3:6-7), as those listed in Romans 12:6-8, out of the inward, initial gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:7. The miraculous gifts, especially speaking in tongues and the interpretation of tongues, do not require any growth in life. However, the gifts developed in life require growth in life, even maturity, for the building up of the church.<p>We need to be impressed with the fact that Paul puts the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge as the first two and tongues and the interpretation of tongues as the last two. This indicates that Paul regarded the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge more highly than tongues and the interpretation of tongues. We may say that the best gift is to speak for Christ and to speak forth Christ. The word of wisdom and the word of knowledge are related to this kind of speaking. We encourage all the saints to seek the gift of speaking the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge and also the gift to speak for the Lord and the gift to speak forth the Lord. As children of God, we have the divine life, and with the divine life there is the gift of speaking. All the believers need to exercise this speaking gift.<h2 class=head2>83. Operating the Gifts in Each One of the Members of the Body of Christ</h2><p>The Spirit also operates the gifts in each one of the members of the Body of Christ. &#8220;The one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one individually as He purposes&#8221; (1 Cor. 12:11). The Spirit not only distributes and manifests but also operates. To operate is to move, to function. The life-giving Spirit works within us to make us proper, functioning members in the Body.<p>In 1 Corinthians 12 the Triune God is involved in three particular things-gifts, ministries, and operations (vv. 4-6). The gifts by the Spirit are to carry out the ministries, the services, for the Lord. The ministries for the Lord are to accomplish the operations, the works, of God. This is the Triune God moving in the believers for the accomplishment of His eternal purpose to build up the church, the Body of Christ, for His expression.<p>We have emphasized the fact that the gifts in chapter twelve are much related to our speaking. Whenever we speak, the Spirit operates. We may think that we are the ones functioning and speaking; actually, the Spirit is the one who functions. As we speak, the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers, and God operates. Our speaking, therefore, is of great importance. If we do not speak, the Spirit does not function, the Lord does not minister, and God does not operate. In a very real sense, the Triune God is waiting for us to speak something for Him.<p>The Spirit desires to function, the Lord wants to minister, and God intends to operate. But this depends on our exercising our spirit to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. Our speaking is crucial to God&#8217;s operation. The more we speak by exercising our spirit, the more the Spirit will function, the Lord will minister, and God will operate. When we speak, the Spirit functions. When the Spirit functions, the Lord ministers. When the Lord ministers, God operates. Therefore, the functioning, ministering, and operating of the Triune God depend on our speaking. Both in the meetings and in our practical daily living, the Triune God responds to our speaking in our spirit by functioning, ministering, and operating.<h2 class=head2>84. Warning Them</h2><p>The Spirit also warns the believers. &#8220;Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit says, Today if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of trial in the wilderness&#8221; (Heb. 3:7-8). This particular warning is related to the Sabbath rest. The speaking Spirit often warns the church.<h2 class=head2>85. Speaking to the Churches</h2><p>In the book of Revelation we see that the Spirit speaks to the churches (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13). Revelation 2:7 says, &#8220;He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&#8221; At the beginning of each of the seven epistles in chapters two and three, it is the Lord who speaks (2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14). At the end of all seven epistles it is the Spirit speaking to the churches. This is a strong indication that the actual speaker is the Spirit. This proves that Christ and the Spirit are one. First we have Christ speaking. Then we are told that the Spirit is the one who speaks. The speaking Christ is the Spirit. Whatever Christ speaks, that is the speaking of the Spirit. Christ is the speaking Spirit. The Spirit is the Lord, and the Lord is the Spirit.<p>If the speaker in Revelation 2 and 3 were only Christ without being the speaking Spirit, He could not speak words into our spirit, and His speaking would not be very subjective and touching. But, as our experience testifies, if we are open in our spirit to the Lord as we read these epistles, the Spirit will speak something of Christ into us. Because the speaker is not the objective Christ but the subjective Spirit, He speaks not only in the letters of the Bible but also in our spirit. Once we hear His speaking, something indelible is wrought into us. It is a marvelous fact that our Christ today is the speaking Spirit.<p>On the one hand, each of the seven epistles in Revelation 2 and 3 is the word of the Lord to a particular church; on the other hand, it is a word of the Spirit to all the churches. Hence, every church should give heed not only to the epistle written to her particularly but also to all the epistles written to the other churches. Because the Spirit today is speaking to the churches, not to a religion, denomination, or group of seeking Christians, we need to be in the churches in order to be rightly positioned to hear the Spirit&#8217;s speaking. When we are in the church and among the churches, we have the right position and angle to hear the speaking of the Spirit. Now we all need an ear to listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches.<h2 class=head2>86. Speaking with the Church</h2><p>Finally, the Spirit speaks with the church: &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, Come!&#8221; (Rev. 22:17). In chapters two and three of Revelation it was the Spirit speaking to the churches. Here, at the end of the book, it is the Spirit and the bride, the church, speaking together as one. This indicates the improvement of the church in experiencing the Spirit.<p>In the New Testament the Spirit signifies the processed Triune God. Actually the Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God. We have seen that Revelation 22:17 says, &#8220;The Spirit and the bride say, Come!&#8221; There is no expression in human language greater than this. The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man. By the time of Revelation 22:17, the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man are married and become a universal couple. This means that the processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man become one.<p>Here in Revelation 22:17 we have two consummations. Divinity has gone through a process-incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension-to become the Spirit, the totality, the consummation, of the Triune God to be the Bridegroom. Humanity also has gone through a process- redemption, regeneration, and transformation-to become the consummation of God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. The consummation of the Triune God and the consummation of God&#8217;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people become one in a universal marriage. The Triune God marries the tripartite man. Here is an eternal couple expressing the Triune God. For eternity the tripartite man will enjoy the Triune God and match Him for His full expression and satisfaction.<p>In these messages we have covered four sections of the Spirit&#8217;s work in the believers: first, the section from initial sanctification, enlightenment, and regeneration through continual sanctification; second, the section of the working of the inner life; third, the section of the work to maintain the divine fellowship; and fourth, the section of the church, ministry, service, and work. From this we see that the work of the Spirit covers all areas of the Christian life and ministry. The Christian life and ministry are altogether in the Spirit, with the Spirit, and of the Spirit. Apart from the all-inclusive Spirit, we can have neither the Christian life nor the Christian ministry. Therefore, we need the infilling of the Holy Spirit and also the outpouring of the Holy Spirit so that we may have an adequate Christian life and work.</body></html>
