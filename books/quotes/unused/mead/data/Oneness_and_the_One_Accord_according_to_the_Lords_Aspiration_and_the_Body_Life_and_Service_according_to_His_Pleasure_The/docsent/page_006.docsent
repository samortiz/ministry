   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRACTICE OF ONENESS The One Accord, Having the Same Mind, Speaking the Same Things</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we will consider the practice of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Oneness is practiced through the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord Jesus taught the disciples in Matthew 18:19, saying, "If two of you agree on earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask, it shall come to them from My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "agree" here, in the original language, means to be in a musical harmony; this is the practice of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the time of Acts 1, there were one hundred twenty people praying steadfastly in one accord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>14-15a .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All of them had one mind, which was to receive power from on high and to testify of the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Lord, whom they loved and followed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For this they were in one mind, and were thus in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the epistles, through the conditions manifested in the various local churches, the Lord shows us further what the one accord is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First Corinthians 1:10 says that we have to speak the same thing and to be attuned in the same mind and the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can we speak the same thing and have the same mind and the same opinion?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The whole book of 1 Corinthians shows us that this same speaking is Christ, and the same mind and same opinion are also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our daily life, if we take Christ as our center and everything, what we speak, think, and understand will all be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the one accord, which is the practice of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some among the Corinthian believers said they were of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Others said they were of Apollos.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Still others said that they were of Cephas.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then some were smart enough to say that they were of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They were of four things.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, there were four minds and four speakings with four results, which end in division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The oneness is gone, the Body of Christ is lost, and the building is no more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, 1 Corinthians 1:10 deals with this matter so that we would be captured by the Lord and that there would no longer be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, but only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Everyone would be thinking about Christ and speaking about Christ, having Christ as his view, Christ as his way of speaking, and Christ as his opinion and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything would be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This Christ has become the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b and has become our enjoyment within.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The practice of our oneness depends on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we speak Him, consider Him, enjoy Him, and express Him, we will be harmonious and one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thinking the Same and Having the Same Love</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, Philippians 2:2 says, "Think the same thing, having the same love, joined in soul, thinking the one thing."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What is it to think the same thing?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And what is to think the one thing?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After reading through the whole book of Philippians, and especially after reading through chapter three, we can see that this refers to the subjective knowledge and experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only Christ is the centrality and universality of our whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Everything else makes our mind different and causes disunity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For this reason we should focus our thoughts on the precious knowledge and experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, we need to have the same love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our love towards the saints should not be classified into categories.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Otherwise, our love will create problems, and there will be no way to have the genuine one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Basis, Means, and Indication of the Practice of the Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From Ephesians 4:4-6 we can see that our practice of oneness is based upon the attribute of the oneness of the church: one Spirit, one Lord, one God, one Body, one faith, one baptism, and one hope.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By this we can see that oneness is the attribute of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Based upon this attribute of the oneness of the church, we can be in one accord and can practice the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Moreover, the practice of this oneness is according to the apostles' teaching 1 Cor 4:17b; 7:17b; 11:16; 14:34a .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The apostles taught the same thing to all the saints in all the places and in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time, the practice of this oneness is also according to the same speaking of the Spirit to the churches Rev 2:7, 11a, 17a, 29; 3:6, 13, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3 were words spoken to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He who has an ear, let him hear.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Each epistle was written to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the churches have the same Bible, and everyone is practicing oneness according to the same speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finally, the practice of oneness indicates that the seven churches as the seven lampstands are completely identical Rev 1:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The churches are God's golden lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although they are distinct and self-contained, they are completely identical in nature, shape, function and expression.</S>
