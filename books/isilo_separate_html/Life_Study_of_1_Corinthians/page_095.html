If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, which you are.&rdquo; Here Paul warns us not to destroy God&rsquo;s temple. When I was a young Christian, I thought that the temple in verses 16 and 17 referred merely to the church in a broad, general sense. Later, as a result of much study and experience, I came to see that whereas the temple in verse 17 may refer to all the believers universally, the temple in verse 16 refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, as in Corinth. The unique spiritual temple of God in the universe has its expression in many localities on earth. Each expression is a temple of God in that locality. Thus, the temple must mean the built up church in a locality. The temple is built up with the believers in a practical way. Regarding the building, first we must gather the materials, and then the materials become part of the building.</p><p>In chapter three Paul warns the Corinthians to take heed how they build. On the positive side, he indicates that they should build on the foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones. On the negative side, he warns them about destroying the temple of God. The Greek word rendered destroy also means ruin, corrupt, defile, mar. To build with wood, grass, and stubble is to ruin, to mar, God&rsquo;s building. According to the context of chapter three, we may destroy the temple either by laying a foundation other than Christ, or by building on the foundation with wood, grass, and stubble. For the Corinthians to say that they were of Paul, Apollos, or Cephas was to lay another foundation and thus to mar the temple. Furthermore, to build with natural things was also to ruin the temple of God.</p><p>The problem with the Corinthians was that they had other foundations consisting of their preferences and choices. According to the context, we defile the temple of God when we boast in men and say that we are of a particular person. Those who have their own choices and preferences may consider themselves wise; actually, they are foolish. As we shall see, at the end of chapter three Paul points out that all things and all servants of the Lord are ours. There is no need for us to have preferences or choices. Therefore, we should not say that we are of anyone or anything. All are ours, we are Christ&rsquo;s, and Christ is God&rsquo;s.</p><p>If we consider the last verses of chapter three according to the context of the first three chapters of this Epistle, we shall see that Paul&rsquo;s concept is that saying we are of someone is to destroy the church. Paul seems to be saying here, &ldquo;The church is in the process of being built up. Some parts have already been built. Do not destroy the church. Do not mar it, ruin it, or defile it. If you build the church with your natural being or your natural makeup, you defile the church. You also ruin the church when you say that you are of Apollos, Cephas, or Paul. If you destroy the church in this way, God will destroy you.&rdquo; On the one hand, to be destroyed by God is to be deprived of the blessing. It is to lack the feeding, the drinking, the eating, the planting, the watering, and the growing. It is also to miss the opportunity to gain the gold, silver, and precious stones. On the other hand, to be destroyed is to be judged by fire and to have our work consumed. However, if we build with gold, silver, and precious stones, our work will remain, and we shall receive a reward (v. 14).</p><p>I encourage you to pray-read these verses in the light of what we have covered in this message. If you do this, you will be nourished and have the divine element infused into you. Then you will experience more transformation, and the church will have more building.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_094.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_096.html">Next</a> </body></html>
