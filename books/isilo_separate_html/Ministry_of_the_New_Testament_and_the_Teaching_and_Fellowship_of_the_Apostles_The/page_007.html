The second item of the spiritual things that was damaged is the teaching of the apostles. Along with this item, the matter of the apostles' fellowship was also misapplied and evilly interpreted by the dissenting ones.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEACHING OF THE APOSTLES</H2><P>In the New Testament the term the teaching of the apostles was used first in Acts 2:42.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Consisting of:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teachings of the Lord Jesus<br>in the Four Gospels</H2><P>The apostles' teaching consists of, first, the teachings of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels. In Matthew 28:19-20 the Lord charged the earlier disciples to teach the new believers all the things that He had commanded them in the four Gospels. Thus, it is clear that the teaching of the apostles includes the teachings of the Lord Jesus in the four Gospels.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>The Teachings of the Apostles in the Acts</H2><P>The teaching of the apostles also includes the teachings of the apostles in the book of Acts (Heb. 2:3). Hebrews 1:1-2a says, "God...has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son." Here it says that in the last days God speaks in the Son, that is, in the person of the Son. From this we can realize that even the speaking of the apostles in the Acts is God's speaking in the Son.</P><P>Surely the Lord's speaking in the four Gospels was God's speaking. However, we may think that it is wrong to say that the apostles' speaking in the Acts also is God's speaking. According to Hebrews 1:2, today God speaks in the Son. In the Greek text there is no article before the word Son. Hence, the verse says, literally, that God speaks "in Son." In his New Translation, J. N. Darby rendered this portion "in [the person of the] Son."</P><P>The entire New Testament economy of God is operated not in the person of the Father, but in the person of the Son through the person of the Spirit. Because all the apostles are the sons of God in the firstborn Son of God, their speaking for God is also God's speaking in the person of the Son. The firstborn Son of God and the many sons of God are considered as one in the person of the Son. Hence, all the speakings by the apostles are God's speaking.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
