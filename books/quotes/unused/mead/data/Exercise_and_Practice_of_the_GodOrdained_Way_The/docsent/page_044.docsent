   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING FLEXIBLE TO MEET VARIOUS NEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>No one can assure you that in any gospel situation there will not be problems.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may ask a person, "Are you a Christian?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He may respond to you with, "I don't like Christianity."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many answer in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have to learn how to shift to another subject.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may tell someone that you are a Christian, and he may respond with, "That's your problem."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then you could say to him, "Yes, this is my problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But, sir, we all have to realize our whole human life is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Is there a human being without a problem?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Having a wife is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not having a wife is also a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Having children is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not having children is also a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Having money is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not having money is also a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In our human life, everything is a problem."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of practical talk should convince him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He may not admit it, but in his heart he will be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then from this point you can turn to the mystery of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"So, sir, human life is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not know where we came from, and we do not know where we will go.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>None of us knows how long we will live."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of normal speaking will open a wide field for you to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One brother related an experience of going with some other brothers to visit a man who had come from mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The brothers first talked to him a little bit about the situation in China.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This opened him up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then they tried to preach the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When they brought out the booklet The Mystery of Human Life, he became very defensive, saying that he was an atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He believed absolutely in communism, and he did not want them to say anything about religion and things of that nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He said they could talk about anything else but not that subject.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, he mentioned that he was trying to learn certain aspects about computers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What he was trying to learn happened to be the field of one of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This caused him to open more and invite them to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the brothers began to wonder if it was really worthwhile to go back to see him again since he told them that he was an atheist.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is definitely worthwhile to go back to see such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His talk has opened a very wide gate for him to be gained.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when the brothers go to him the next time, they should only talk about computer hardware and software.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Later, there will be a proper time for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It may be the third or fourth time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers have to wait for a chance.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If there is a little crack, the living water can get in. They can then take advantage of that little crack to speak the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must go to practice preaching the gospel with much patience by having a spirit to learn, to be discipled.</S>
