        <h2 class="head2">The Lord&rsquo;s Recovery Being at a Standstill</h2>
<p>Taiwan is the birthplace of my work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of China. Hall one of the church in Taipei was built under my supervision. I designed the blueprint. I began the work in Taiwan more than thirty-eight years ago on August 1, 1948. When I visited Taiwan three and a half years ago, I was shocked by the attendance figures. When I left Taiwan for America in 1961, there were over twenty thousand saints in the church in Taipei, and about one-fourth of them were active and meeting regularly. Twenty-three years later the number in the church in Taipei dropped to a little over ten thousand. When I inquired of the brothers, they said that quite a few had died, many had gone abroad, and others had moved or lost contact with us and could not be located. No matter how many reasons we may have, the unique reason for the decrease in the number of saints is our lack of fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>In the early days I worked in San Francisco in America. In 1958 some brothers requested me to appoint a few elders for the church. At that time there were over twenty saints meeting regularly. After thirty years the church has approximately two hundred saints, including Chinese and Caucasians. This is an increase, but it is very slow. This slow increase is due to our lack of fruit-bearing.</p>
<p>The brothers in Taiwan told me that they have baptized many people and brought many to salvation. Where are all these ones today? Most of them &ldquo;died&rdquo; prematurely because they lacked care. Hence, we have two weak points: we do not bear enough fruit, and our fruit does not remain.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Contradicting the Lord&rsquo;s Law</h2>
<p>These two weak points are the result of contradicting the Lord&rsquo;s law. The Lord commissioned us to go forth and bear remaining fruit. However, we made the big mistake of inviting people to come instead of going forth. After the previous message a saint testified that his small group had a love feast to preach the gospel. The sisters prepared several dishes, and the brothers gave out invitations to people, but eventually only two people came. Another brother testified that he also prepared love feasts for the gospel, but no one came. These things happen because we have contradicted the Lord&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s charge at the end of Matthew is a great word: &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and disciple all the nations&rdquo; (28:18-19). We need to go by the authority that has been given to the Lord. At the end of Mark the Lord said, &ldquo;Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all the creation&rdquo; (16:15). We have acted contrary to the Lord&rsquo;s law: instead of going forth, we ask and compel people to come. We exert much effort to drag people to hear the gospel. This is our first mistake.</p>
<p>It is true that some people come when we invite them. When I was in Taipei, we invited many people who came and were baptized, but few remained. If a hundred were baptized, they would eventually die one by one until less than five remained. The reason is that they were not given proper care. The new ones did not die immediately, but they died after a period of time. We must give newborn babes long-term care if we want them to remain. If we do not take care of them, we are contrary to the law of nature. This is our second mistake.</p>
<p>In 1984 I noticed that there was no increase in most of the churches in the East and in the West. The churches that had some increase had a very slow rate of increase. This situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is not limited to one place; it is everywhere. In 1984 we had nearly eight hundred churches in six continents, but there has not been an increase in the number of saints. In other words, we are not bearing fruit, because we do not go forth.</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that we must go forth. The Lord Jesus preached the gospel by coming down from heaven. From His point of view, He came to us. When He preached the gospel in His earthly ministry, He went from Galilee to the land of Judea and from the land of Judea to Galilee. He visited the home of Zaccheus, and He waited for the woman in Samaria. He went with the gospel. Later, the Lord sent out seventy disciples and charged them to go from house to house to look for the sons of peace. This is the principle in the Bible: go to preach the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head2">An Effective Way</h2>
<p>During the last one and a half years of the full-time training in Taipei, there have been about eight hundred trainees. Their experiences have helped us in our study of the new way in order to find out some guidelines. We discovered that many people will not get saved unless we visit them in their homes. Many of these people are college professors who are between fifty and sixty years old. These people would not come to a gospel event. However, we can gain them if we go to their homes. Going from house to house is the most effective way to find the sons of peace.</p>
<p>Six months ago more than fifteen hundred saints attended the summer training in Anaheim. Instead of having evening training meetings, we asked the trainees to form groups and go out to knock on doors. As a result, we baptized over thirty-seven hundred new ones, sixty percent of whom were Spanish-speaking people who were formerly Catholics. This news probably spread to the Catholic authorities, because in September and October of last year three hundred Catholic bishops gathered for a conference to discuss how to cope with this situation. As a conclusion to the conference, the chairman said, &ldquo;Unless a person goes out to knock on doors, he has not yet given himself to the gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the ten days of door-knocking during the summer training, we had an elders&rsquo; meeting for the elders in the United States. The elders admitted that the training brought great joy to all the saints. Based on the brothers&rsquo; fellowship, I said that our practice may be compared to the children of Israel keeping a feast; hence, we should practice door-knocking. Many localities responded to this fellowship. In September the churches in the San Gabriel Valley held a door-knocking festival, and many saints were revived. However, I am concerned that such a fire of revival may burn for only a moment, and then the saints will become colder than they were previously. Although it is good to have a festival, we need to live a normal life.</p>
<p>Six months ago over thirty-seven hundred people were baptized, and at least another eight hundred were baptized through them. Therefore, a total of forty-six hundred people are being taken care of by about seventy saints who finished two or three terms of full-time training in Taiwan. Babies need to be nourished; otherwise, they will die prematurely. As a result of the endeavoring of the seventy saints, about fifteen hundred new ones have remained. Half of them attend meetings about once or twice a month, so their situation is not too good. The other half, however, have home meetings at least once a week. These seven hundred are the best harvest. Through them several new local churches have been raised up. Other new ones have been added to existing churches.</p>
<p>Through the door-knocking festival that was carried out by the churches in the San Gabriel Valley, over one thousand people were gained. Some saints who have been to the training in Taipei went to San Gabriel to care for the new ones. Eventually, over two hundred new ones have remained, and the churches in Monterey Park and in San Gabriel City have been raised up. Therefore, within less than a year we gained around one thousand new ones in Southern California. This almost equals the total number of saints in all the churches in Southern California. In less than a year the churches have increased more than twofold. For the past fourteen years we have not had a one-percent increase, let alone a twofold increase, or an increase of one hundred percent. Through two door-knocking festivals we gained one thousand remaining fruit even though people rejected the gospel, and there were negative situations. This proves that knocking on doors is the most effective way. Visiting people in their homes is the most excellent way to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>This way is revealed in the Bible, and it is also logical. People do not come when we invite them; they do not want to come. But when we visit them, they are hesitant to refuse. If they refuse to open the door, we still can say a few words to them. It may be easier to knock on doors in Taiwan than in America. According to the statistics gathered by the training in Taipei, only three out of ten doors refused to open to us. Sometimes when someone opened the door, the saints simply stepped inside with smiles beaming on their faces. Once inside they would sit down and talk with the person for a short while and then bring out <em>The Mystery of Human Life.</em> In less than ten minutes this person would begin to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name, and in another five minutes he would be baptized. For every twenty doors that we knocked on, at least one person was baptized. In the last year and a half we have knocked on seven hundred fifty thousand doors and baptized forty thousand people. We have knocked on some doors three or four different times. Some trainees knocked on the door of a home that is very close to the meeting hall, and the owner said, &ldquo;This is the fifth time you have come to knock on my door. I admire your persistence, so I have decided to be baptized. You do not have to persuade me anymore. If I am not baptized, you will come again.&rdquo; He knows us. Some may say that he was baptized because he was embarrassed to turn us down; therefore, he is not truly saved. However, according to the Lord&rsquo;s words, we do not have the right to discern between true believers and false believers (Matt. 13:24-30, 37-43). If someone calls on the Lord&rsquo;s name, confesses his sins, repents, and desires to be baptized, we should baptize him in the name of the Lord (Acts 8:36-38).</p>
<p>From our research we know that there will be one son of peace for every twenty doors that we knock on. Therefore, as long as there are twenty homes in an apartment building, we will baptize at least one person if we go there to knock on doors.</p>
<p>We should not be bothered if someone refuses to open the door or gives us a dirty look. Instead, we should politely say, &ldquo;We will come at another time.&rdquo; Door-knocking does not violate the law; hence, if he calls the policeman, we will not be arrested. If we visit him again, he may eventually &ldquo;surrender,&rdquo; accept, and become a son of peace. This is truly the best way. It is not a wonder that the Bible compares leading people to salvation to fishing. The most foolish way to go fishing is to prepare a lot of bait on the shore and ask the fish to jump out of the water to bite the bait. We must admit that we have been foolish. The Lord said that those who preach the gospel are fishermen, &ldquo;fishers of men&rdquo; (Matt. 4:19). We should therefore go to the fishpond to catch fish instead of foolishly asking the fish to jump out of the water.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
