<h1 class="title">BEING UP TO DATE WITH THE AGE<br />
TO PERFECT THE SAINTS</h1>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s recovery has been advancing in the divine revelation. We also need to advance in practice so that we match the revelation that the Lord has shown us. In particular, the co-workers should seek the Lord regarding how to be up to date with the age and how to have an effective work for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HOLDING ON TO THE OLD FOUNDATION<br />
AND RESOLUTELY SEEKING CHANGE</h2>
<p>God created the earth; hence, it cannot be changed by man. However, methods of transportation can change and have been advancing. In order to travel on the earth, mankind first invented wheels and then all kinds of vehicles, including the horse-drawn wagon, the bicycle, and the automobile. Today there are not only cars but also airplanes, and the manufacturing of airplanes is also improving. Likewise, the Bible has not changed in the past two thousand years, but our knowledge of the Bible is continually progressing. We cannot change the Bible, nor can we change the Lord&rsquo;s way, but our knowledge of the Bible and how we carry out the Lord&rsquo;s work should progress. If we still work in the way that we were trained twenty years ago, we will become outdated. If a military school teaches the same thing for twenty years, it will become outdated because strategies, tactics, and weapons change. Old knowledge can only serve as a foundation upon which we need to continue to study and advance.</p>
<p>Old knowledge can be useful and also harmful. Consider a young man who goes to a military school for training but who has never received a military education. His weakness is that he does not have a foundation in military knowledge, but his strength is that he can learn quickly because he is not limited by background knowledge. In contrast, a soldier who has received military education has a foundation of military knowledge. This is a strength, but if he insists on the old ways, his strength will become a weakness. However, if he does not insist on the old ways but uses this foundation as a means to learn new material, he can advance quickly.</p>
<p>By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, over the past years we have had some changes in our work for the Lord, but we are not resolute. We should be so resolute that we would willingly not hold on to the old foundation. It is difficult to completely let go of a foundation, but if we continue to rely on the old ways, they will become a hindrance to our moving forward.</p>
<p>The co-workers have not made a thorough turn. They still hold old concepts. When the age turns, whoever turns quickly will have the upper hand, and whoever turns slowly will fall behind. Because my mother received a modern education and had some knowledge of the modern age, she insisted that I learn English. My hometown was not a modern city. At that time whoever learned English was mocked as having a foreign accent. Later, however, it was acknowledged that those who speak better English have the upper hand. Those who can turn quickly and thoroughly with the age will have the upper hand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOGNIZING THE SITUATION,<br />
KNOWING THE TIMES, AND TURNING WITH THE AGE</h2>
<p>The present situation indicates that the Lord has turned the age. Some of the younger generation have surpassed us in their abilities. When I listen to them speak for the Lord in the meetings, I feel that the older generation lacks their portion. According to Matthew 25, the producing of the gifts is related to ability. Verse 15 says, &ldquo;To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability.&rdquo; <em>Talents</em> refers to spiritual gifts, and <em>ability</em> refers to natural capabilities. The gifts given to us by the Lord differ according to our natural capabilities. For example, if I am dumb, the Lord will not give me the gift of speaking, because I do not possess that ability. The Chinese have a saying: &ldquo;There are only champion students but not champion teachers.&rdquo; This means that a teacher who is not a champion should not think that his students cannot become champions. Champion students are often taught by teachers who are not champions. However, teachers with champion students should not become proud. Teachers have knowledge and common sense, but their students have talent. Teachers pass their knowledge and common sense to the students, and when the students begin to apply what they learn, their talent is manifested.</p>
<p>The age is turning, the Lord is moving, the church is turning, and the young adults are rising up. What should the co-workers do? The co-workers must recognize and know the times, the trend of the age. In other words, the co-workers must know themselves and their situation. More than twenty years ago the churches in Taiwan were in a beginning stage. The churches needed trained co-workers to help them, and the co-workers were able to help the churches. This was the case in Taiwan and in other places in Southeast Asia. However, the age has turned. The co-workers need to reconsider their situation and their function. I am afraid that some co-workers still have the concept that the churches should listen to them and accept their leading because they have been serving full time for many years. Such a concept might not have been a problem twenty years ago, but it will bring in conflicts today.</p>
<p>Those who are rising up today are better than we are in many ways. If the co-workers are not up to date, they will eventually create conflicts. This can be compared to insisting on teaching an airplane pilot how to ride a horse. The co-workers have the seniority, but it is no longer the age of riding horses; it is the age of jet planes. It is useless for co-workers to give old messages. Not everyone in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is prudent, but some in the younger generation are prudent and up to date with the age. If they are learning how to pilot an airplane, we should not teach them how to ride a horse.</p>
<p>The age is turning, and we must keep up with the age. If we continue to teach the doctrines that we learned in the past, we are not up to date with the age. What we learned in the past can only be a foundation. We must keep up with the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date way in order to perfect the young adults.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_010.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_012.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Age of the One New Man &nbsp; pg 11</div><br></body></html>
