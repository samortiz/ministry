<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>With this lesson we will begin to consider the believers&rsquo; future. In their past in eternity, the believers were foreknown, chosen, and predestinated by God. Furthermore, in the past they were created by God but became fallen and dead in offenses and sins. The believers&rsquo; present comprises both the initial stage and the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation. In the initial stage, the stage of regeneration, the believers have been called by God and separated unto Him; they have repented, believed, and been baptized; and they have been joined to the processed Triune God, redeemed, made a new creation, and saved. Finally, in the initial stage, they have cleared the past. In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience and enjoy the processed Triune God in His triune dispensing. They experience God&rsquo;s redemption continuously, they enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation, they experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity corporately, and they experience this dispensing in other aspects. Eventually, at the end of the progressing stage, the believers will be conformed to the image of Christ, the firstborn Son of God, and look to and wait for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming back to usher them into their future.</p>
<p>The first aspect of the believers&rsquo; future is in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification. The initial stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation is the stage of regeneration, the progressing stage is the stage of transformation, and the completing stage is the stage of glorification. We have experienced a good deal of transformation and are heading toward the goal of glorification. The seed of the divine life has been sown into us. Now this seed is growing, developing gradually until it reaches full growth, the maturity in life. At that time there will be a &ldquo;blossoming&rdquo; of the divine seed within us. That will be our glorification. Glorification is the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<p>Many believers have only an objective concept of glorification. According to this concept, one day those who have been saved and regenerated will suddenly be glorified. They claim that the glorification of the believers will take place instantaneously at the coming of the Lord Jesus. Certain Scriptures seem to prove this. For example, Colossians 3:4 says, &ldquo;When Christ our life is manifested, then you also will be manifested with Him in glory.&rdquo; However, our glorification will actually be the consummation of a process of gradual growth and development in the divine life. First, we are regenerated; that is, we receive the divine life into us. Then, as the divine life grows in us, it saturates us with the divine element, and this element changes us metabolically so that we are transformed organically. In our Christian experience transformation is simply the growth in the divine life. This can be compared to a plant; as it grows, it is transformed from one appearance to another. This process of growth and transformation continues until the plant reaches maturity, glorification. In like manner, our regeneration is followed by transformation, and transformation issues in glorification. Without regeneration there is no possibility of transformation. Furthermore, if we are lacking in transformation, there will be no glorification. Glorification is the issue of transformation, and transformation is accomplished through the gradual and continuous growth in life. Just as the blossoming of a carnation flower is the issue of the gradual growth of a carnation plant, so our glorification will not be an accident; it will be the issue of our growth in the divine life unto maturity. A carnation does not blossom until it has reached maturity, and in like manner, the believers will not be glorified, brought into the full expression of the Triune God, until they reach maturity in life.</p><h2 class="head1">I. BEING GLORIFIED</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will be glorified. God has predestinated and justified us, and now He is conforming us to the image of His firstborn Son. Eventually, we will be fully glorified. Concerning this, Romans 8:29-30 clearly says, &ldquo;Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers; and those whom He predestinated, these He also called; and those whom He called, these He also justified; and those whom He justified, these He also glorified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Paul speaks of predestination, calling, justification, and glorification in this portion of the Scriptures, he uses the past tense: predestinated, called, justified, and glorified. This indicates that every item in these verses, including even glorification, is an accomplished fact. Although we think that glorification is something that will happen only in the future and that in our experience we still have not been glorified, the Bible says that we have already been glorified. Paul speaks in this way because even though as created beings we are subject to time, God is not. He is the God of eternity. With Him there is no time factor. Therefore, in the sight of God, we have already been predestinated, called, justified, and glorified. These matters were accomplished in eternity. This also indicates that our glorification is secured and ensured in the eternal God.</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s sight we have already been glorified. Nevertheless, according to our experience glorification will take place in the future. Christ, the hope of glory (Col. 1:27), has been sown into us as the seed of glory, and this seed will grow until it reaches the stage of blossoming. For God to glorify us means that He causes the glory that has been sown into us to saturate our entire being and to be expressed through us. When our entire being has been permeated and saturated with the element of glory, that glory will come out of us. This is what it means for the believers to be glorified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Receiving the Incomparable Glory</h2>
<p>For the believers to be glorified is to receive the incomparable glory. In Romans 8:18 Paul says, &ldquo;I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed upon us.&rdquo; We have not yet been glorified and cannot imagine what this incomparable glory is, but we strongly believe, according to the revelation of the New Testament, that the glory we are to receive in the future is incomparable. Present sufferings mean nothing in comparison to the coming glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Manifesting Christ as<br />
the Hope of Glory within Us</h2>
<p>We have been predestinated to be glorified. This is our future. Today Christ is living in us as our hope of glory. Colossians 1:27 says, &ldquo;Christ in you, the hope of glory.&rdquo; <em>Glory</em> in this verse is &ldquo;the glory&rdquo; in Greek and denotes Christ, who is God&rsquo;s expression, the effulgence of God&rsquo;s glory (Heb. 1:3). Hence, this glory is not a thing but a living person, the indwelling Christ, the all-inclusive embodiment of the processed Triune God. Through regeneration Christ as the glory came into us, and now we have the seed of glory in us as our hope of glory. When Christ returns to glorify us, this glory will come out of us and will be manifested to the fullest extent. Hence, the glory is a hope; it is the hope of glory. Christ Himself is this hope of glory.</p>
<p>Christ can be our hope of glory because He dwells in our spirit to be our life and our person. In Colossians 3:4 Paul says that when Christ our life is manifested, then we also will be manifested with Him in glory. When Christ comes again and is manifested, we will be glorified in Him, and He will be glorified in us, that is, in our redeemed and transfigured body (Rom. 8:23; Phil. 3:21; 2 Thes. 1:10). This indicates that the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being, including our physical body. This will cause our body to be transfigured and to become like His glorious body. At that time Christ will be glorified in us.</p>
<p>Today this glory is still a hope to us because it has not come out of us. Since the seed of glory has been sown into us, we hope to see it blossoming. On the one hand, Christ will come from outside of us; on the other hand, He will come from within us. One day, at His return, Christ as the glory within us will come out of us and be fully manifested. He will be glorified in us, and we will be fully in the expression of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Reaching the Goal of God&rsquo;s Predestination</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers reach the goal of God&rsquo;s predestination. This goal is our glorification. God has predestinated us for this goal. Hence, God&rsquo;s predestination is our destiny. Our glorification will be our participation in the goal of God&rsquo;s predestination (1 Cor. 2:7). We are vessels of mercy, which God has before prepared unto glory (Rom. 9:23), and He has called us into this glory (2 Thes. 2:14; 1 Pet. 5:10). Christ Himself is our hope of glory, and today we exult and boast in this hope of glory (Rom. 5:2). When this hope, Christ, is manifested, we &ldquo;also will be manifested with Him in glory&rdquo; (Col. 3:4). At that time, God&rsquo;s glory will not only have spread from our spirit into our soul but will also be expressed through our body. The three parts of our being&mdash;spirit, soul, body&mdash;will be the same as Christ is and will be fully saturated with God&rsquo;s glory. This is our participation in the ultimate goal to which God has predestinated us in eternity.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Being Called into the Eternal Glory,<br />
the Glory of Our Lord Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>Our glorification is also our being called by the God of all grace &ldquo;into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:10). God&rsquo;s calling us in Christ Jesus indicates that God has passed through the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish a complete and full redemption so that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself. Thus, we may participate in the riches of the processed Triune God as our enjoyment. Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us. It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that the God of all grace can call us into the enjoyment of His eternal glory and perfect, establish, strengthen, root, and ground us in the Triune God, thus, enabling us to attain His glorious goal. What a miracle that fallen sinners like us can be brought into God&rsquo;s eternal glory!</p>
<p>Moreover, 2 Thessalonians 2:14 says that God has called us through the gospel so that we may obtain the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ. The glory of the Lord Jesus Christ is the glory given to the Son by the Father (John 17:22), which is the sonship with the Father&rsquo;s divine life and nature (5:26) to express the Father in His fullness (1:18; 14:9; Col. 2:9; Heb. 1:3). The Son has given this glory to us so that we also may have the sonship with the Father&rsquo;s divine life and nature (John 17:2; 2 Pet. 1:4) to express the Father in the Son in the Son&rsquo;s fullness (John 1:16). What a glory! God has called us to obtain this glory, the glory of the divine life and the divine nature to express the Divine Being.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Enjoying the Glory of the Children<br />
of God with Its Freedom</h2>
<p>According to Romans 8:21, when the believers are glorified, they will enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom. Although we are sons of God, we have not yet been manifested, for we are still under a veil. One day the veil will be removed, and that will be our glorification. The sons of God will come out from under the veil and will be revealed to the whole creation. Then the sons of God will enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom, and the whole universe will behold the sons of God in glory and participate in the freedom of this glory.</p>
<p>As a result of the fall of Adam, the entire creation is under bondage and corruption. All creation, which has been subjected to vanity, is groaning, and it is travailing together in pain until now. Therefore, creation is anxiously watching, eagerly awaiting the revelation of the sons of God in the hope that it will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (vv. 19-23). This indicates that God has promised that we, the believers in Christ, will be glorified and will enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom. However, creation will share only in the freedom of our glory, not in the glory itself. Although creation will not share in our glory, it will enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God. In the future we will enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being in the Glory of the Divine Sonship</h2>
<p>When the believers are glorified, they will be in the glory of the divine sonship. Hebrews 2:10 says that the Father with the Son is leading us, the many sons, into glory. We are sons of God, but we are not yet in glory. Just as a caterpillar is transformed into a butterfly, we are being led into glory. One day we will be in glory as the many sons of God. Our glorification will be our full sonship. We will be glorified in the divine life and the divine nature to bear the glory of the Triune God for His expression.</p>
<p>Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus will eventually become a glorified son of God. We will all be brought into the glory of God and shine with His glory. This is the full salvation of all those who believe in Christ. At that time, we will bear the righteousness of God outwardly, be saturated with the holiness of God inwardly, and shine in the realm of His full glory as His sons. In this glory God will be expressed in a full way in His redeemed, transformed, and glorified people. This will be the ultimate issue of the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the believers&rsquo; future is in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification. Our glorification will be the consummation of the process of gradual growth and development in life. First, we are regenerated; then, as the divine life grows in us, it saturates us with the divine element, and this element changes us metabolically so that we are transformed organically. This process of growth and transformation continues until we reach maturity, glorification. This is to be brought into the full expression of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will first be glorified. Our glorification is an accomplished fact. In the sight of God, we have already been predestinated, called, justified, and glorified. In eternity these items have already been accomplished. Therefore, our glorification is secured and ensured in the eternal God.</p>
<p>For the believers to be glorified is for them to receive the incomparable glory. Present sufferings mean nothing in comparison to the coming glory. We have been predestinated to be glorified. Today Christ is in us as our hope of glory. When Christ comes again and is manifested, the indwelling Christ will saturate our entire being, including our physical body. This will cause our body to be transfigured and become like His glorious body. At that time, Christ will be glorified in us. Our glorification will be our participation in the goal of God&rsquo;s predestination. The God of all grace has called us in Christ Jesus into His eternal glory and is also perfecting, establishing, strengthening, rooting, and grounding us, thus, enabling us to attain His glorious goal. When we are glorified, we will enjoy the glory of the children of God with its freedom. When all the sons of God are manifested to all of creation, the whole universe will behold the sons of God in glory and participate in the freedom of this glory. When we, the believers, are glorified, we will be in the glory of the divine sonship. Today the Father with the Son is leading us, the many sons, into glory. Everyone who believes in the Lord Jesus will eventually become a glorified son of God. We will all be brought into the glory of God and shine with His glory. In this glory God will be expressed in a full way in His redeemed, transformed, and glorified people. This will be the ultimate issue of the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will see that in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will experience the redemption of their body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. BEING REDEEMED IN THEIR BODY</h2>
<p>In Romans 8:23 Paul speaks of &ldquo;the redemption of our body.&rdquo; To be redeemed in our body is to be glorified (v. 30). Hence, glorification and the redemption of our body are synonymous. No matter how mature we may become in the divine life, as long as we have not been glorified, we have not been redeemed in our body. Only when we are glorified will our body be redeemed. Therefore, the believers will be glorified and redeemed in their body simultaneously.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 1:30 says that Christ has become &ldquo;wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&rdquo; This indicates that in God&rsquo;s full salvation Christ is righteousness (for our past), by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life (Rom. 5:18). Then He is sanctification (for our present), by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with His divine life (6:19, 22). Eventually, Christ will become our redemption (for our future), that is, the redemption of our body, by which we will be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness (Phil. 3:21). God&rsquo;s complete and perfect salvation will make our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;organically one with Christ and will make Christ everything to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Enjoying the Full Divine Sonship</h2>
<p>When the believers are redeemed in their body, glorified, they will enjoy the full divine sonship, of which the Holy Spirit is the foretaste, the firstfruits. Romans 8:23 says, &ldquo;Not only so, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body.&rdquo; The firstfruits of the Spirit are simply the Spirit as the firstfruits of the coming harvest of what God is to us. The firstfruits are the Holy Spirit as a sampling of the full taste of God, that is, as the foretaste of the full blessing to come. We have received and are enjoying the Spirit; we are enjoying the processed Triune God as our everything. The full taste of this will come in the day of glory. Before the full taste comes, God gives us a foretaste today. This foretaste is the Spirit as the firstfruits of the harvest of the full enjoyment of all that the processed Triune God is to us.</p>
<p>The issue of our enjoyment of the Spirit as the firstfruits is the redemption of our body, which is the full sonship. We have sonship in our spirit through regeneration, and we may also have sonship in our soul through transformation, but we do not yet have sonship in our body through transfiguration. Therefore, although we have received the sonship, having the beginning of the sonship spoken of in Galatians 4:5, we will not obtain the full sonship until our body is transfigured to be conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory (Phil. 3:21). As we are enjoying the Spirit as the foretaste, we are still groaning, hoping for, and eagerly awaiting the sonship in our body, that is, the redemption of our body, in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Redeemed<br />
as God&rsquo;s Acquired Possession</h2>
<p>The redemption of the believers&rsquo; body is for redeeming God&rsquo;s acquired possession. Ephesians 1:14 says that the Holy Spirit &ldquo;is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession.&rdquo; As God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, we are His possession, which He acquired with the precious blood of Christ (Acts 20:28). In God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, the processed Triune God has become our inheritance, and we have become God&rsquo;s possession. How marvelous! We give nothing, and we get everything! God acquired us at a cost, but we inherit God at no cost.</p>
<p>Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption God has acquired, secured, purchased us to be His possession. Therefore, the redemption of our body, that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious one (Phil. 3:21), is for redeeming God&rsquo;s acquired possession. In His salvation God first gives Himself to us as our inheritance with the Holy Spirit as a pledge. Then we begin to enjoy God as our inheritance. Actually, our experience of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is our enjoyment of God as our inheritance in a practical way. As we enjoy God as our inheritance, His element comes into our being and transforms us to make us His inheritance for His enjoyment. Therefore, the coming glorification will not be only for us but also for God. The redemption of our body will be both for our enjoyment and God&rsquo;s enjoyment. The Holy Spirit within us is not only a foretaste but also a pledge, guaranteeing that God is ours and that we will be His. He is our inheritance for our enjoyment, and we will become His inheritance for His enjoyment.</p>
<p>The Triune God has put His Spirit into us as a pledge, guaranteeing that He will be our inheritance unto the redemption of our body. We are God&rsquo;s possession, yet our body is still in the old creation. Therefore, we still need to be redeemed in our body unto the redemption of God&rsquo;s possession. Daily we enjoy the Triune God in the way of the Spirit&rsquo;s pledging. To enjoy God in this way as our inheritance is to receive the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us. Eventually, we will be saturated with Him and constituted of Him as our inheritance. This enjoyment and constitution will make us His inheritance. One day, as God&rsquo;s inheritance, we will be redeemed in our body into His glory to be His possession in glory for Him to gain us and enjoy us in full.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being the Issue of the Sealing<br />
of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>The redemption of the believers&rsquo; body is the issue of the sealing of the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30). The Holy Spirit is the seal and also the sealing. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit as the seal is put in us once for all. The sealing of the Holy Spirit, however, is not a once-for-all matter. Rather, this sealing is still taking place in us today. At the time of our salvation we were sealed, and even until now we are still being sealed. Paul says in Ephesians 4:30 that we were &ldquo;sealed unto the day of redemption.&rdquo; The word <em>unto</em> indicates that our being sealed continually with the Holy Spirit results in, or issues in, the redemption of our body. We were sealed with the Holy Spirit, and we are continually experiencing the sealing of the Holy Spirit with a view to the redemption of our body.</p>
<p>When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we were sealed in our spirit and began to experience the sealing. However, we have not yet been sealed with the Holy Spirit in the various parts of our soul&mdash;our mind, emotion, and will. Hence, this sealing, which begins in our spirit, is spreading into our mind, emotion, and will to saturate us and transform us with the divine element through the divine dispensing. One day even our body will be sealed with the Spirit, for our body will be saturated with the Spirit. That will be the day of the redemption of our body. Thus, we will be made God&rsquo;s inheritance.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being to the Praise of God&rsquo;s Glory</h2>
<p>The redemption of our body will be to the praise of God&rsquo;s glory (1:14). God&rsquo;s glory is God expressed. God wants to be glorified, expressed, in His New Testament believers. Today this expression is not visible, but one day it will be visible. At that time our God will be fully glorified and expressed though us and among us. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s expression through His New Testament believers will call forth universal praise. We will become a corporate body to express God, and the entire universe will praise His glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Their Body of Humiliation Being Transfigured<br />
and Conformed to the Body of Christ&rsquo;s Glory</h2>
<p>For us to be redeemed in our body is not only to enjoy the full divine sonship but also to have our body of humiliation transfigured and conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory (Phil. 3:21). When the Lord Jesus returns, our body will be transfigured, fully redeemed, glorified. This is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation. After we are transfigured, we will be the same as Christ in all three parts of our being.</p>
<p>In Philippians 3:21 Paul refers to our body as &ldquo;the body of our humiliation.&rdquo; This describes our natural body, which is made of worthless dust (Gen. 2:7) and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death (Rom. 6:6; 7:24; 8:11). But one day this body will be transfigured and conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. Christ&rsquo;s body of glory is His resurrected body, which is a mystery. On the day of His resurrection, He appeared to His disciples with such a body. Although He had a body that could be seen and touched, He came into a room while the doors were shut (John 20:19). Christ&rsquo;s resurrected body, the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory, is saturated with God&rsquo;s glory (Luke 24:26) and transcendent over corruption and death (Rom. 6:9).</p>
<p>Our spirit has been regenerated and our soul may be fully transformed, but our body remains old. With all its physical weaknesses and illnesses, our body is under the power of death. It is mortal and subject to infirmity and death. Our body may be enlivened by the Spirit who indwells us (Rom. 8:11), but it is still a mortal body subject to death and needing to be redeemed. By cooperating with the Spirit in our spirit, we may experience the Lord&rsquo;s spreading of the divine life into our body to enliven and even to saturate it to a certain degree. Nevertheless, no matter how much our body may be enlivened and even saturated by the Spirit, it still requires the Lord&rsquo;s full redemption. This is the reason that we often groan in ourselves (v. 23). When the Lord comes back, He will transfigure the body of our humiliation. Then &ldquo;we will be like Him&rdquo; (1 John 3:2) not only in our spirit and in our soul but also in our body. At that time we will be in His full likeness both inwardly and outwardly, from the center of our entire being to the circumference, from our innermost part, our spirit, to our outermost part, our body. That will be the ultimate consummation of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. According to the Operation of Christ, by Which<br />
He Is Able Even to Subject All Things to Himself</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s transfiguring the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory, will be &ldquo;according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo; (Phil. 3:21; cf. Eph. 1:19-22). To transfigure our body of humiliation is a difficult matter and needs the operation of the One who is able to subject all things to Himself. This is the almighty power in the whole universe.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Being at Christ&rsquo;s Appearing<br />
from the Heavens</h2>
<p>The transfiguration of our body will take place at Christ&rsquo;s appearing from the heavens (Phil. 3:20). At the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, He will transfigure our body of humiliation. Hence, we are waiting for Christ to come back so that we may be brought into the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;the transfiguration of our body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Death in Their Entire Being Swallowed Up<br />
by the Resurrection Life unto Victory</h2>
<p>For the believers to be redeemed in their body is also to have death in their entire being swallowed up by the resurrection life unto victory. First Corinthians 15:54 says, &ldquo;When this corruptible will put on incorruption and this mortal will put on immortality, then the word which is written will come to pass, &lsquo;Death has been swallowed up unto victory.&rsquo;&rdquo; Death means defeat to man. Through Christ&rsquo;s salvation in the resurrection life, death will be swallowed up unto victory to us, the beneficiaries of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life. Hence, the time is coming when the last enemy, death, will not only be destroyed but also swallowed up by resurrection life.</p>
<p>When our corrupted and mortal body is resurrected, that is, transfigured from corruption and death into glory and life, then death will be swallowed up unto victory. This is the consummation of the resurrection that we partake of in God&rsquo;s New Testimony economy through the redemption and salvation we enjoy in Christ. This resurrection begins with the enlivening of our dead spirit and is completed with the transfiguration of our corruptible body. In between is the process of the metabolic transformation of our fallen soul by Christ as the life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18), who is the reality of resurrection. Resurrection is the victory of life over death.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Corruptible Putting On Incorruption</h2>
<p>When death in our entire being is swallowed up by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, &ldquo;this corruptible will put on incorruption&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:54). Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit; incorruption is the consequence of life saturating our body (Rom. 8:11). At present, we have a corruptible body. But when, by being saturated with life, our body is transfigured at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming, our body will become incorruptible. In this way, the corruptible will put on incorruption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Mortal Putting On Immortality</h2>
<p>Furthermore, when the death in our entire being is swallowed up by the resurrection life, &ldquo;this mortal will put on immortality&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:54). In 2 Corinthians 5:4 Paul says, &ldquo;We who are in this tabernacle groan, being burdened, in that we do not desire to be unclothed, but clothed upon, that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.&rdquo; &ldquo;What is mortal&rdquo; denotes our mortal body (4:11; Rom. 8:11; 1 Cor. 15:53). To be burdened means to be weighed down, depressed, oppressed. Our fallen, mortal body is a great burden to us. Under such a great burden, the apostle groaned in his desire not to be unclothed, disembodied, or found naked, that is, not to die, but to be clothed upon, to put on a transfigured body. Like Paul, although we groan under the great burden of our body, our desire is not to be disembodied, not to die, but to be clothed with a spiritual body, to be transfigured. When we are transfigured and clothed with the heavenly, spiritual, and resurrected body, then what is mortal will be swallowed up by life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will experience the redemption of their body. To be redeemed in our body is to be glorified. As long as we have not been glorified, we have not been redeemed in our body. Therefore, we will be glorified and redeemed in our body simultaneously. God&rsquo;s complete and perfect salvation is to make our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;organically one with Christ and to make Christ everything to us.</p>
<p>When the believers are redeemed in their body, they will enjoy the full divine sonship. We have sonship in our spirit through regeneration, and we may also have sonship in our soul through transformation. We will obtain the full sonship when our body is transfigured to be conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. The redemption of our body is the redeeming of God&rsquo;s acquired possession. Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God has acquired, secured, purchased us to be His possession. Therefore, the redemption of our body, that is, the transfiguration of our body of humiliation into a glorious one, is for God&rsquo;s acquired possession to be redeemed. This is the issue of the sealing of the Holy Spirit. At the time of our salvation we were sealed. However, even until now we are still being sealed unto the day of redemption. The redemption of our body will be to the praise of God&rsquo;s glory. One day we will become a corporate body to express God, and the entire universe will praise His glory.</p>
<p>The redemption of our body is also to have our body of humiliation transfigured and conformed to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory so that we will be the same as Christ in all three parts of our being. This is the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation. When the Lord comes back, His transfiguring the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory, will be according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself. Therefore, we are waiting for Christ to come back so that we may be brought into the ultimate consummation of God&rsquo;s salvation&mdash;the transfiguration of our body.</p>
<p>For the believers to be redeemed in their body is also to have death in their entire being swallowed up by the resurrection life unto victory. The time is coming when the last enemy, death, will not only be destroyed but also swallowed up by resurrection life. When death in our entire being is swallowed up by Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life, the corruptible will put on incorruption, and the mortal will put on immortality.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson and in the following lesson we will consider the rapture of the believers, which is the third item of the believers&rsquo; future in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BEING RAPTURED</h2>
<p>Being glorified, redeemed in our body, and raptured are actually three aspects of one thing. To be glorified is to be redeemed in our body, and to be redeemed in our body is to be raptured.</p>
<p>The rapture of the believers is a great matter in the Bible and is emphasized strongly in the New Testament. Generally speaking, during the past century and a half there have been three main schools of understanding among Christians concerning the rapture: the pretribulation school, the posttribulation school, and the so-called partial rapture school. Those of the pretribulation school say that the believers&rsquo; rapture will take place before the great tribulation, which, strictly speaking, will be the last three and a half years of this age. These three and a half years will be the second half of the last week of the seventy weeks revealed in Daniel 9. Those in the posttribulation school say that the rapture will take place at the end of the great tribulation. Those in the partial rapture school say that the overcomers will be raptured earlier than the majority of the believers. The Bible teachers in this school include G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton. They taught that, according to the New Testament, the believers who are overcomers and who mature earlier will be raptured before the great tribulation, but the remainder of the believers will pass through most of the great tribulation so that they may be helped to mature. These believers will be raptured close to the end of the great tribulation. The teachers in this last school have accurately seen the details concerning the Lord&rsquo;s coming back and the believers&rsquo; rapture.</p>
<p>The Bible presents two main aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers. Leviticus 23:10 presents a type related to the two aspects of the believers&rsquo; rapture&mdash;the type of crops ripening in the field. Some crops ripen earlier, and others ripen later. The crops that ripen first are the firstfruits, and those that ripen later are the harvest. In Old Testament times the firstfruits were brought from the field not to the barn but to the temple of God. This is seen in Exodus 23:19, which says, &ldquo;The first of the firstfruits of your ground you shall bring into the house of Jehovah your God.&rdquo; The firstfruits were brought into the temple of God for His enjoyment and satisfaction. When the rest of the crop in the field was completely ripe, that was the time of the harvest. After the harvest was reaped, it was brought into the barn. The crop signifies God&rsquo;s people (1 Cor. 3:9). The first of the crop to ripen is the firstfruits, the overcoming believers, who will be brought directly to God&rsquo;s temple in the heavens. Later, after the rest of the crop has ripened, the majority of the believers will be harvested and taken to the air (1 Thes. 4:15-17).</p>
<p>Now, we will consider in a brief and simple way the rapture of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Dead Overcomers<br />
through All the Generations, as the Man-child, Being Resurrected and Caught Up</h2>
<p>Revelation 12:5 says that the woman &ldquo;brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo; The female, according to nature in God&rsquo;s creation, is weaker than the male, physically and psychologically (1 Pet. 3:7). Hence, the man-child in Revelation 12:5 signifies the stronger part of God&rsquo;s people. The fact that the man-child &ldquo;is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod&rdquo; indicates that the man-child is composed of the overcomers spoken of in 2:26-27. These overcomers are the dead overcoming saints, who will be resurrected before the last three and a half years, the period of the great tribulation. The man-child should also include the martyred saints who cry out to the Lord in the fifth seal (6:9-11). These believers &ldquo;loved not their soul-life even unto death&rdquo; (12:11). <em>Unto death</em> indicates martyrdom. Beginning with Abel, who was the first martyr, all the martyred overcomers throughout the generations are waiting for the time of resurrection (see &ldquo;The Chart of the Seventy Weeks and the Coming of Christ, with the Rapture of the Saints&rdquo; in the Recovery Version of the Bible). The resurrection of the dead overcomers will be the delivery of the man-child. After the dead overcomers are resurrected, they will be raptured to God and to His throne.</p><h2 class="head3">1. To God and to His Throne</h2>
<p>The man-child will be raptured to God and to His throne. Their rapture differs from that of the majority of the believers in 1 Thessalonians 4:17. The rapture of the majority of the believers will be to the air, whereas the rapture of the man-child will be to the throne of God in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Before the Last Three and a Half Years,<br />
the Period of the Great Tribulation</h2>
<p>The man-child will be raptured before the last three and a half years, twelve hundred sixty days, which is the period of the great tribulation (Rev. 12:5-6, 14).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The One Hundred and Forty-four Thousand<br />
Living Overcomers, as the Firstfruits<br />
of God&rsquo;s Harvest on the Earth, Being Raptured</h2>
<p>Revelation 14:1 says, &ldquo;I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.&rdquo; Verse 4 says, &ldquo;These were purchased from among men as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.&rdquo; Among God&rsquo;s people, a group of early overcomers will be reaped before the harvest as firstfruits, like the firstfruits in the good land, and brought into the temple of God to be offered to God and to the Lamb. This means that the living overcomers, who have been purchased from among men and who followed the Lamb absolutely, will be raptured to God&rsquo;s temple in the heavens before the rapture of the majority of the believers. One hundred and forty-four thousand in verse 1 is an actual number but with a symbolic meaning: it has a spiritual significance. One hundred and forty-four thousand is one thousand multiplied by twelve times twelve. Twelve is the number of completion in God&rsquo;s eternal administration. One hundred and forty-four (21:17) is twelve times twelve, which signifies the completion of completions, the ultimate completion in the fullest way. The one hundred and forty-four thousand firstfruits signify the believers who accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Among the believers living on earth at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, some will have ripened early, and, being the first to mature, they will become the firstfruits in God&rsquo;s field.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. To Mount Zion in the Heavens</h2>
<p>The one hundred and forty-four thousand firstfruits will stand with the Lamb, Christ, on Mount Zion. Zion in Revelation 14:1 is the Zion in the heavens (Heb. 12:22), where God and His throne are and where Christ is.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. For the Fresh Enjoyment of God and Christ</h2>
<p>The one hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers will be raptured for the fresh enjoyment of God and Christ. This shows the difference between the man-child in Revelation 12 and the firstfruits in chapter 14. The man-child is for fighting and for defeating Satan. Hence, the man-child deals with the enemy. The firstfruits are not for fighting but for the satisfaction of God and the Lamb. The enemy, the devil, must be cast down from heaven by the man-child, who will execute God&rsquo;s judgment over the enemy. But there is another need in the heavens&mdash;God and Christ must have the firstfruits in order to obtain fresh enjoyment and satisfaction. God and Christ desire to taste some firstfruits for Their satisfaction. If we realize this, we will desire to ripen earlier for the satisfaction of God and Christ. This is the attitude of the living overcomers, the earliest ones of God&rsquo;s crop to mature, those who satisfy the hunger and thirst of God the Father and of the Lamb, the Redeemer.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Before the Great Tribulation</h2>
<p>The one hundred and forty-four thousand living overcomers will be raptured to Mount Zion in the heavens before the great tribulation (14:1-13). They are the living overcomers, the firstfruits. The majority of the believers, signified by the harvest (vv. 14-16), will be raptured toward the end of the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Rest of the Overcoming Believers,<br />
Who Will Be Living at the Time of<br />
the Lord&rsquo;s Parousia, Being Raptured</h2>
<p>The rapture of the overcomers will also include the rest of the overcoming believers who will be living at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. They are signified by one of the two men working in the field and one of the two women grinding at the mill in the day and also by one of the two on one bed (Matt. 24:40-41; Luke 17:34). The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;At that time two men will be in the field; one is taken and one is left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one is taken and one is left&rdquo; (Matt. 24:40-41). The reason one is taken and one is left is that there is a difference between them in the matter of life. The growth in life unto maturity makes the difference. Those who are mature will be taken, raptured, before the great tribulation. Those who are immature will be left to pass through the great tribulation, which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth (Rev. 3:10) and a snare that comes suddenly upon all those dwelling on the face of the earth (Luke 21:34-35). The rapture of the overcoming believers will occur secretly, even unexpectedly, and it will be in different places and at different times. Therefore, we need to be watchful and take heed of our growth in life because we do not know on what day our Lord comes.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Standing before the Son of Man in the Heavens</h2>
<p>The rest of the overcoming believers, who will be living at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, will be raptured to stand before the Son of Man in the heavens. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man&rdquo; (v. 36). <em>Stand</em> in this verse has the meaning of being put in a certain place. This refers to our being raptured to the presence of Christ. <em>Stand before the Son of Man</em> corresponds to the standing of the overcomers in Revelation 14:1. At the time of the rapture of the living overcomers, Christ will not yet have left heaven to come down to the air. Therefore, the minority of those who are taken, the living overcomers, will stand before the Savior on Mount Zion in the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Escaping All the Things of<br />
the Great Tribulation and Being Kept<br />
out of the Time of the Great Tribulation</h2>
<p>The Lord promises that if we are watchful and beseeching at every time, we will &ldquo;prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen&rdquo; (Luke 21:36). &ldquo;All these things which are about to happen&rdquo; are the things of the great tribulation. <em>Escape</em> signifies being taken, raptured, before the great tribulation. If we are able to escape or are counted worthy to escape the coming tribulation, we will be raptured to, placed in, His presence.</p>
<p>In Revelation 3:10 the Lord said, &ldquo;Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth.&rdquo; <em>Trial</em> in this verse undoubtedly denotes the great tribulation that is about to come on the whole inhabited earth (Matt. 24:21). The Lord promised the overcoming believers in Philadelphia that He will keep them out of the hour of trial (not just out of the trial but out of the <em>hour</em> of trial) because they have kept the word of His endurance, the word of His suffering. This implies that those who have not kept the word of His endurance will be left in the great tribulation. Therefore, to be kept out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, is to be kept out of the great tribulation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The rapture of the believers is a great matter and is emphasized strongly in the New Testament. There are two main aspects of the rapture: the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of the majority of the believers. Leviticus 23:10 presents a type related to the two aspects of the believers&rsquo; rapture; it is a type of crops ripening in the field. Some crops ripen earlier and others ripen later. Those that ripen first are the firstfruits, and those that ripen later are the harvest. The firstfruits, the overcoming believers, will be brought directly to God&rsquo;s temple in the heavens. Later the crop, the majority of the believers, will ripen, be harvested, and taken to the air.</p>
<p>The overcomers through all the generations who have died, as the man-child among the believers, will be resurrected and caught up before the last three and half years, the period of the great tribulation. The man-child should also include the martyred saints who cry out to the Lord in the fifth seal. These believers loved not their soul-life even unto death. After their resurrection, they will be raptured to God and to His throne. In addition, among God&rsquo;s people there will be a group of living overcomers who have been purchased from among men and who followed the Lamb absolutely. They are the one hundred and forty-four thousand firstfruits who will be raptured before the majority of the believers to stand with the Lamb, Christ, on Mount Zion for the fresh enjoyment of God and Christ. There is a difference between the man-child and the firstfruits. The man-child is for fighting and for defeating Satan. Hence, the man-child deals with the enemy.

The rest, the minority, of the overcoming believers, who will be living at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, will be raptured to stand before the Son of Man in the heavens. The Lord promises that if we are watchful and beseeching at every time, we will prevail to escape all the things of the great tribulation.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue from the previous lesson to consider other aspects of the rapture of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. The Majority of the Believers,<br />
Who Have Died through All the Generations,<br />
Signified by the Ten Virgins,<br />
Rising Up from the Dead</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus returns, the believers will be of two classes, signified by the numbers two in Matthew 24 and ten in Matthew 25. The totality of the believers is signified by the number twelve. Because the two men and two women are working (24:40-41), they represent the believers who will be alive when the Lord returns. The ten virgins, on the contrary, were asleep (25:1, 5), indicating that the majority of the believers will have died by the time the Lord returns. When the Lord returns, the majority of the believers, who have died through all the generations, as signified by the ten virgins, will rise up from the dead.</p>
<p>Matthew 25:1 says, &ldquo;At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.&rdquo; Virgins signify believers in the aspect of life (2 Cor. 11:2). The believers are like pure virgins, bearing the Lord&rsquo;s testimony (the lamp) in the dark age and going out of the world to meet the Lord. The lamps in Matthew 25:1 signify the spirit of the believers (Prov. 20:27), which contains the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:16) as the oil. The believers shine with the light of the Spirit of God from within their spirit. Thus, they become the light of the world, like a lamp shining in the darkness of this age (Matt. 5:14-16; Phil. 2:15-16) to bear the testimony of the Lord for the glorification of God. The virgins &ldquo;went forth to meet the bridegroom.&rdquo; This signifies that the believers are going out of the world to meet the coming Christ as the Bridegroom, as the most pleasant and attractive person (John 3:29; Matt. 9:15).</p>
<p>The Lord promised to come quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed, and still He delays His coming. Because of this delay the virgins &ldquo;became drowsy and slept&rdquo; (25:5). Becoming drowsy signifies becoming sick (Acts 9:37; 1 Cor. 11:30), and going to sleep signifies dying (1 Thes. 4:13-16; John 11:11-13). While the Lord delays His coming back, the majority of the believers first become sick and then die. Matthew 25:6 says, &ldquo;At midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Go forth to meet him!&rdquo; Midnight signifies the darkest time of this dark age (night). That will be the end of this age, the time of the great tribulation. The cry signifies the voice of the archangel (1 Thes. 4:16). &ldquo;Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps&rdquo; (Matt. 25:7). <em>Arose</em> signifies resurrection from the dead (1 Thes. 4:14). This is the resurrection predicted in 1 Thessalonians 4:16 and 1 Corinthians 15:52. After the virgins arose, they trimmed their lamps. This signifies the virgins&rsquo; dealing with the testimony in their living and indicates that after their resurrection, the believers still need to deal with the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in their living.</p>
<p>Matthew 25:2 says that five of the virgins were &ldquo;foolish&rdquo; and five were &ldquo;prudent.&rdquo; Five is composed of four plus one, signifying that man (signified by four) is added with God (signified by one) to bear responsibility. Five virgins being foolish and five being prudent does not indicate that half the believers are foolish and the other half are prudent. It indicates that all believers bear the responsibility to be filled with the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Prudent Ones, Who Take Oil in Their Vessels<br />

<p>Verse 4 says, &ldquo;The prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.&rdquo; Man is a vessel made for God (Rom. 9:21, 23-24), and man&rsquo;s personality is in his soul. Hence, <em>vessels</em> in Matthew 25:4 signifies the soul of the believers. The five prudent virgins not only had oil in their lamps but also took oil in their vessels. Having oil in their lamps signifies that they have the Spirit of God dwelling in their spirit (Rom. 8:9, 16), and taking oil in their vessels signifies that they have the infilling of the Spirit of God saturating their souls.</p>
<p>Through regeneration we have the Spirit of God in our spirit. This causes our lamps to burn. However, the question is whether we have the extra portion of the Holy Spirit filling our soul. Although we have oil in our lamp, we still need an extra portion of oil in our vessel, our soul. This means that the Spirit must spread from within our spirit to every part of our soul. Then we will have an extra portion of the Holy Spirit in our soul. If we have this extra portion, we are prudent. Without this extra portion of the Spirit, we cannot be watchful and ready. In order to be watchful and ready, we need the infilling of the Holy Spirit, the spreading of the Spirit Himself from our spirit to every part of our inward being.</p>
<p>The virgins who were ready were invited to go in with the bridegroom to the wedding feast, and the door was shut (Matt. 25:10). This wedding feast is the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:9), which will be spread in the air (1 Thes. 4:17) on the path of the Lord&rsquo;s coming (parousia). The wedding feast will occur before the manifestation of the kingdom as a reward of mutual enjoyment with the Lord to the believers who are ready, who have been equipped with the infilling of the Holy Spirit before they die.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Foolish Ones,<br />
Who Take No Oil in Their Vessels<br />
with Their Lamps and Who Are Not Ready,<br />
Also Coming to the Lord but Being Rejected<br />
from His Wedding Feast</h2>
<p>Matthew 25:3 says, &ldquo;The foolish, when they took their lamps, did not take oil with them.&rdquo; Oil signifies the Holy Spirit (Isa. 61:1; Heb. 1:9). The foolish virgins were foolish because they had oil only in their lamps but not an extra portion of oil in their vessels. In addition to the regenerating Spirit, they did not have the infilling Spirit, the extra portion of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. Needing to Go and Buy the Oil for Their Vessels</h2>
<p>The foolish virgins represent the believers who have been regenerated by the Spirit of God and have the Spirit of God indwelling them but are not filled with the Spirit of God so that He saturates their whole being. After their resurrection, they will still need to pay a price to obtain the infilling of the Holy Spirit. We need to understand that the infilling of the Holy Spirit is obtained at a cost, such as giving up the world, dealing with the self, loving the Lord above all, and counting all things loss for Christ. If we do not pay the price today, we must pay it after our resurrection, because others cannot obtain the infilling of the Holy Spirit for us (Matt. 25:9). Those who do not pay the price do not have an extra portion of the Holy Spirit. Eventually, after their resurrection the foolish virgins must pay the price to buy the oil to fill their vessels.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Missing the Wedding Feast of the Lamb</h2>
<p>The foolish virgins, who do not take oil in their vessels and are not ready when the Lord Jesus comes, will miss the wedding feast of the Lamb (v. 10). Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Later the rest of the virgins came also, saying, Lord, lord, open to us!&rdquo; The foolish virgins arrive after going to buy the oil. The later coming of the foolish virgins refers to the later rapture of the resurrected believers. They paid the price for the extra portion of oil, but they obtained the oil too late; hence, when they arrived at the wedding feast, the door was shut. When they asked the Lord to open the door for them, the Lord said, &ldquo;I do not know you&rdquo; (v. 12). To not know in this verse indicates not recognizing, not approving. This means that the believers who do not pay the price to gain the oil in their vessels will miss the reward dispensationally, but they do not lose their salvation eternally.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being Raptured into the Lord&rsquo;s Parousia</h2>
<p>According to the New Testament, Christ&rsquo;s coming will be His presence with His believers; this is His parousia. In 1 Thessalonians 4:15 Paul says, &ldquo;This we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord, shall by no means precede those who have fallen asleep.&rdquo; The Greek word translated &ldquo;coming&rdquo; in this verse is <em>parousia.</em> The Lord&rsquo;s presence, the Lord&rsquo;s parousia, will continue for a period of time. His parousia will begin when the overcomers are raptured to the throne of God in the heavens (Rev. 12:5; 14:1), it will continue with the Lord&rsquo;s coming to the air (10:1), and it will end with His coming to the earth (Matt. 24:27, 30; Rev. 1:7). During the Lord&rsquo;s parousia, there will be the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air (1 Thes. 4:15-17), the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10), and the marriage of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9).</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Dead Believers Rising Up First</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 4:16 says, &ldquo;The dead in Christ will rise first.&rdquo; The dead believers, signified by the ten virgins, will be the first to rise up and be raptured into the Lord&rsquo;s parousia.</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. The Resurrection of Those Who Are Christ&rsquo;s</h2>
<p>Speaking of resurrection, Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:23, &ldquo;Each one in his own order: the firstfruits, Christ; then those who are Christ&rsquo;s at His coming.&rdquo; Those who are Christ&rsquo;s are the believers in Christ, the righteous ones, who will be resurrected unto life at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back before the millennium (John 5:29; Luke 14:14; 1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:52; Rev. 20:4-6).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. The Resurrection of Life</h2>
<p>In John 5:28 and 29 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;An hour is coming in which all in the tombs will hear His voice and will come forth: those who have done good, to the resurrection of life; and those who have practiced evil, to the resurrection of judgment.&rdquo; In these verses we have two kinds of physical resurrection. The resurrection of life is the resurrection of the saved believers before the millennium. The dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the return of the Lord Jesus. Hence, their resurrection is called the resurrection of life. When the Lord Jesus comes back, all the dead believers will be resurrected and will be taken along with the living believers to the air (1 Thes. 4:16-17). However, the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the millennium in order to be judged at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-15). Hence, their resurrection is called the resurrection of judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. The Resurrection of the Righteous</h2>
<p>In Luke 14:14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;It will be repaid to you in the resurrection of the righteous.&rdquo; The resurrection of the righteous is the resurrection of life; it is the time when God will reward the saints at the Lord&rsquo;s return (Rev. 11:18; 1 Cor. 4:5). Therefore, the resurrection of the righteous is a resurrection with a reward.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. The First Resurrection</h2>
<p>Revelation 20:4-6 says, &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years...This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection; over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.&rdquo; Here the word <em>lived</em> means &ldquo;were resurrected&rdquo;; it refers to the first resurrection and the best resurrection. It is not only the resurrection of life (John 5:29; 1 Cor. 15:23; 1 Thes. 4:16) but also the resurrection of reward (Luke 14:14), the out-resurrection, that is, the extraordinary resurrection, which the apostle Paul sought (Phil. 3:11), the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers so that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom. Therefore, &ldquo;blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.&rdquo; This is the highest blessing&mdash;to inherit the kingdom of God manifested on earth and even to be co-kings with Christ within the kingdom. Not only the resurrected overcomers, such as the man-child in Revelation 12:5 and the later martyrs in 15:2, but also the raptured living believers, such as the firstfruits in 14:1-5, will have part in this first resurrection. We should not be content merely to be in the general resurrection; rather, we should aspire to be in the first, the best, resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head4">e. The Out-resurrection</h2>
<p>In Philippians 3:11 Paul says, &ldquo;If perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.&rdquo; The out-resurrection from the dead denotes the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints. This means that it is the resurrection set apart from the common resurrection. It is the resurrection with honor and respect and is comparable to a graduation with honors. This is a resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers so that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom. All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from the dead at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, but the overcoming believers will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection. This is the better resurrection spoken of in Hebrews 11:35. The better resurrection is not only the first resurrection, the resurrection of life, but also the out-resurrection, the extra-resurrection, the resurrection in which the Lord&rsquo;s overcomers will receive the reward of the kingdom (v. 26).</p>
<p>To arrive at the out-resurrection means that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected. God first resurrected our deadened spirit (Eph. 2:5-6). Then from our spirit He proceeds to resurrect our soul (Rom. 8:6) and our mortal body (v. 11), until our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;is fully resurrected out of our old being by His life and with His life. This is a process in life through which we must pass until we arrive at the out-resurrection as the prize. Hence, the out-resurrection should be the goal and purpose of our Christian life.</p><h2 class="head3">2. The Living Believers, Who Are Left and<br />
Who Will Still Remain until the Lord&rsquo;s Coming, Being Caught Up at the Same Time Together<br />
with the Resurrected Ones</h2>
<p>After the dead ones among the believers, signified by the ten virgins, have been resurrected, the living believers, signified by one of the two men and one of the two women in Matthew 24:40 and 41 and one of the two in Luke 17:34, who are left and who will still remain until the Lord&rsquo;s coming, will be caught up at the same time together with the resurrected ones. First Thessalonians 4:17 says, &ldquo;We who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and thus we will be always with the Lord.&rdquo; According to this verse, both the dead and the living believers will be caught up to the Lord. First the dead will be raised, and then together we will be caught up to meet the Lord in the air.</p>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 4:15 and 17 Paul speaks of those &ldquo;who are living, who are left remaining unto the coming of the Lord&rdquo; and of those &ldquo;who are living, who are left remaining.&rdquo; This indicates, or at least implies, that there are some living ones who do not remain. These living ones who do not remain are overcomers. There is a difference between the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of those believers who are alive and remain until the Lord&rsquo;s coming. The rapture of the overcomers will take place before the last three and a half years, a period known as the great tribulation. In other words, the overcomers will be raptured before the tribulation (Rev. 3:10). But those who are alive and remain will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation, that is, at the last trumpet (1 Cor. 15:52).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. In the Clouds</h2>
<p>The believers who are alive and remain will be caught up &ldquo;in the clouds&rdquo; (1 Thes. 4:17).</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Meeting the Lord in the Air</h2>
<p>Verse 17 also says that those believers who are alive and remain unto the Lord&rsquo;s coming will be caught up &ldquo;to meet the Lord in the air.&rdquo; This shows that the difference between the rapture of the overcomers and the rapture of those believers who are alive and remain until the Lord&rsquo;s coming is not only regarding time but also regarding location. In Revelation 12 the overcomers are raptured to the throne of God in the third heaven (vv. 5-6, 14), but in 1 Thessalonians 4:17 the rapture of those who are alive and remain will be to the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Being Always with the Lord</h2>
<p>The majority of the believers, both the dead and resurrected ones and the living ones at the Lord&rsquo;s coming, after being raptured to meet the Lord in the air, will be always with the Lord to enjoy His presence by seeing Him face to face (1 John 3:2). Then they will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence much more than what they enjoyed of His presence in their spirit while they lived on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus returns, the majority of the believers who have died through all the generations will rise up from the dead. Among them, some are foolish and some are prudent. The prudent ones are ready and will be invited to go in with the Bridegroom to the wedding feast, the marriage dinner of the Lamb. This marriage dinner will occur before the manifestation of the kingdom as a reward of mutual enjoyment with the Lord to the believers who are ready, who are equipped with the infilling of the Holy Spirit before they die. After they go in to the marriage feast, the door will be shut. The foolish ones, who are not ready, will also come to the Lord at His wedding feast but will be rejected. These believers have been regenerated by the Spirit of God and have the Spirit of God indwelling them but are not filled with the Spirit of God such that He saturates their whole being. Hence, after their resurrection, they will still need to pay a price to obtain the infilling of the Holy Spirit. Furthermore, because of their need to obtain the infilling of the Spirit, they will miss the wedding feast of the Lamb and lose the reward dispensationally.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, Christ&rsquo;s coming will be His presence with His believers; this is His parousia. During the Lord&rsquo;s coming, the dead believers will be the first to rise up and be raptured into His parousia. Those who are Christ&rsquo;s, that is, the believers in Christ, will be resurrected unto life at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back before the millennium. This is the resurrection of life. In addition, when the Lord comes back to reward the saints, the overcoming believers will receive the resurrection of the righteous. This resurrection is not only the resurrection of life but also the first resurrection, the best resurrection, the resurrection of reward. This extraordinary resurrection is the out-resurrection, which the apostle Paul sought. It is the resurrection of kingship as a reward to the overcomers so that they may reign as co-kings with Christ in the millennial kingdom. Therefore, blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. This is the highest blessing&mdash;to inherit the kingdom of God manifested on earth and even to be co-kings with Christ within the kingdom. This out-resurrection should be the goal and purpose of our Christian life.</p>
<p>After the dead ones among the believers have been resurrected, some of the living believers, those who are left and who will still remain until the Lord&rsquo;s coming, will be caught up at the same time together with the resurrected ones in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Those who are alive and remain will be raptured at the end of the great tribulation, that is, at the last trumpet. After being raptured to meet the Lord in the air, they will be always with the Lord to enjoy His presence by seeing Him face to face. Then they will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence much more than what they enjoyed of His presence in their spirit while they lived on earth.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will see in detail how the believers, in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ, which is the judgment seat of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. BEING JUDGED AT<br />
THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST&mdash;<br />
THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will be glorified, redeemed in their body, resurrected, and raptured. Being glorified, redeemed, resurrected, and raptured is a procedure that will bring the believers to the judgment seat of Christ for them to be judged.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Five Judgments Revealed<br />
in the New Testament</h2>
<p>Some believers think that there is only one kind of judgment in the New Testament&mdash;to decide whether people will perish or be saved. However, the truth revealed in the Bible concerning God&rsquo;s judgment is much more detailed. In the New Testament there are at least five kinds of judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Lord Jesus Being Judged<br />
on the Cross by God</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the Lord Jesus was judged on the cross by God. The crucifixion of the Lord was a judgment, for the righteous God judged the Lord Jesus as our Substitute. Hence, the Lord Jesus was judged by God on our behalf.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. As the House of God, the Believers Being Judged by God in the Church Age</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that as the house of God, the believers are being judged by God in the church age. First Peter 4:17 says, &ldquo;It is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s house, or household, is the church, which is composed of the believers (2:5; 1 Tim. 3:15). God judges His people so that they may be disciplined, purified, and sanctified from the unbelievers. Such disciplinary judgment begins from God&rsquo;s own household. Therefore, if we are careless in doing things, we will be judged. Instead of using the word <em>judgment,</em> we may speak of being disciplined, chastised, and corrected. However, discipline, chastisement, and correction are actually God&rsquo;s judgment. God is always right and righteous, and He will not allow anything under His rule to be wrong. For this reason, when we have unseemly conditions, He sometimes judges us so that we may be disciplined.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Believers Being Judged<br />
at the Judgment Seat<br />
of Christ at His Coming Back</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the believers will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ at His coming back. After all the dead saints have been resurrected and raptured and all the living ones have been raptured, a judgment seat will be set up for Christ to judge all His genuine believers. This judgment will determine whether the believers will receive a reward or some kind of dispensational punishment. Paul says, &ldquo;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:10). The judgment seat spoken of in this verse is the place where Christ will judge His believers at His coming back. This judgment is not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15).</p>
<p>Romans 14:10 also speaks of the believers being judged: &ldquo;We will all stand before the judgment seat of God.&rdquo; The judgment in this verse is different from the eternal judgment of God spoken of in 2:2-3, 5, 16, and 3:8, which will be carried out at the great white throne revealed in Revelation 20:11-15. The eternal judgment at the great white throne will be after the millennium. It will be to judge all the dead unbelievers, and it will be for eternal punishment in the lake of fire. However, the judgment at the judgment seat of God, or the judgment seat of Christ, will be before the millennium, immediately after Christ&rsquo;s coming back. It will be to judge all the resurrected and raptured believers, and it will be for reward or punishment in the millennial kingdom.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Living Being Judged<br />
at Christ&rsquo;s Throne of Glory before the Millennium</h2>
<p>The New Testament reveals that the living will be judged at Christ&rsquo;s throne of glory before the millennium (Matt. 25:31-46). When the Lord Jesus, together with His overcomers, defeats Antichrist and his army, many Gentiles will still be living on earth. The Lord will gather these Gentiles to Himself and judge them. &ldquo;When the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory. And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats&rdquo; (vv. 31-32). Those who are regarded as sheep will be transferred into the millennium to be the people under the kingly ruling of Christ and His overcoming believers (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5; 20:4-6) and under the priestly ministry of the saved Jews (Zech. 8:20-23). Those who are regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, &ldquo;into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels&rdquo; (Matt. 25:41).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Dead Unbelievers Being Judged by Christ<br />
at the Great White Throne after the Millennium</h2>
<p>Finally, the New Testament reveals that the dead unbelievers will be judged by Christ at the great white throne after the millennium. Christ is the Judge of the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1). The living unbelievers will be judged before the millennium, but the dead will be judged afterward at the great white throne, as revealed in Revelation 20:11-15. The dead unbelievers will be condemned by the Lord because of their evil deeds and will perish because of their unbelief, not having their names written in the book of life. Christ will judge the dead unbelievers in order to determine their eternal perdition.</p>
<p>Three of the five judgments in the New Testament are concerned with the believers. We should put ourselves under the judgment that was carried out through the cross of Christ. As believers, we have already been judged eternally, for we were judged in Christ on the cross. Just as Noah and his family were judged by the flood but were inside the ark, so we have been judged by God on the cross in Christ. Furthermore, since we are saved and have become members of God&rsquo;s family, we are under God&rsquo;s family judgment. God is judging His own house, and we are members of His family. Every day we need to realize that we are under this judgment, a judgment that is not for perdition or salvation but for correction and transformation. We need this judgment. Finally, we will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ in the air. This judgment will determine our destiny in the millennium; it will decide whether we will be rewarded to enter into the kingdom in order to enjoy the blessing of eternal life, or we will suffer some kind of punishment in the coming age. Therefore, as believers we are involved with three judgments: the judgment on the cross, the judgment in God&rsquo;s house, and the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p>In all His judgments the Lord is righteous. He is wise and just, and He will not allow His people to be loose or wrong. Formerly we were sinners, but now we have become God&rsquo;s children. As God&rsquo;s children, we are not free to do things in a loose way. God is very strict with His people. He exercises His family judgment in His house according to His will to correct us so that we may grow and experience more transformation. Eventually, at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, He will judge us to decide whether we will receive a reward or punishment in the coming age. This judgment will take place after our rapture.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Believers Being Judged<br />
at the Judgment Seat of Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Recompensed<br />
for the Things That They Have Done,<br />
according to What They Have Practiced,<br />
Whether Good or Bad</h2>
<p>The believers will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ in order to be recompensed for the things that they have done. In 2 Corinthians 5:10 Paul says that every believer will be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ so that &ldquo;each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad.&rdquo; Dean Alford points out that the word <em>receive</em> is the technical word for receiving wages. While we are still at home in our body, we should do things through our body to please the Lord so that at His coming the Lord may reward us for our deeds.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Each One Giving<br />
an Account of Himself to God<br />
for the Lord to Settle Accounts with Him</h2>
<p>At the judgment seat of Christ, each believer will give an account of himself to God in order for the Lord to settle accounts with him. Matthew 25:19 speaks of this: &ldquo;After a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them.&rdquo; <em>A long time</em> signifies the entire church age, and <em>came</em> signifies the Lord&rsquo;s descending to the air (1 Thes. 4:16) in His coming (parousia). <em>Settled accounts</em> signifies the Lord&rsquo;s judgment at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; Rom 14:10) in the air (within His parousia), where the believers&rsquo; living, conduct, and work will be judged for reward or punishment (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 3:13-15; 4:5).</p>
<p>When the believers appear before the judgment seat of Christ, they will give an account of how they lived before the Lord and what kind of work they did for the Lord after they were saved. We will have to tell Him what we did and what we gained for Him. This will be very difficult, for we will have to relate to the Lord what we did in our life as believers. This is to give an account of ourselves to God for the Lord to settle accounts with us.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Being Examined by the Lord,<br />
Who Will Both Bring to Light<br />
the Hidden Things of Darkness and<br />
Make Manifest the Counsels of the Hearts,<br />
That Praise May Be to Each One from God</h2>
<p>At the judgment seat of Christ the believers will be examined by the Lord. In 1 Corinthians 4:4-5 Paul says, &ldquo;He who examines me is the Lord. So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God.&rdquo; <em>Before the time</em> means before the day of the Lord (3:13). We often hide the things of darkness and the counsels of our heart. But these will be brought to light and made manifest at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. One day, at the judgment seat of Christ, the things in our heart will be made manifest. If our heart is right, good, pure, and for God, then at the judgment seat of Christ we will be rewarded with praise from God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Lord Rendering a Reward to Each One according to His Work</h2>
<p>At the judgment seat of Christ, the Lord will reward each one of His believers according to his work. In Revelation 22:12 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is.&rdquo; The phrase <em>I come quickly</em> is the Lord&rsquo;s repeated warning (vv. 7, 20) so that we may consider His reward at His coming back. This reward is the wages rendered to each one according to all the things that he has done.</p>
<p>This reward will be rendered to the believers at the Lord&rsquo;s coming, after their rapture, at the judgment seat of Christ. While some will receive a reward, some will suffer loss. The defeated believers will be punished and thus lose their reward, but they will not lose their salvation. The punishment that the Lord will measure to them is related to a certain dispensational punishment, not to eternal perdition. In other words, the defeated believers will be saved, yet so as through fire (1 Cor. 3:15).</p>
<p>The believers who overcome&mdash;by building the Body of Christ with gold, silver, and precious stones in their Christian life (v. 12), willingly serving the saints for the building (14:26), preaching the gospel (9:16-17), denying their self and taking up their cross to follow the Lord (Matt. 16:24-27), pursuing toward the goal (Phil. 3:14), not casting away their boldness (Heb. 10:35), serving as the faithful and prudent slaves whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time (Matt. 24:45-47), and being faithful to use their gifts (25:14-30)&mdash;will receive a reward at the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers&rsquo; glorification, redemption, resurrection, and rapture is a process that brings them to the judgment seat of Christ for them to be judged.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, God&rsquo;s judgment on man is not only to decide whether he will perish or be saved; there are at least five judgments. The first judgment revealed in the New Testament was exercised by God when the Lord Jesus was on the cross. The crucifixion of the Lord was a judgment, for the righteous God judged the Lord Jesus as our Substitute. The New Testament reveals that in the church age God is judging His house. God judges us so that we may be disciplined, purified, and sanctified from the unbelievers. Furthermore, before the millennium, immediately after Christ&rsquo;s coming back, the believers will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ in order to determine whether they will receive a reward or a dispensational punishment. This judgment is after all the dead saints have been resurrected and raptured and all the living ones have been raptured. There will also be the judgment of the living unsaved ones at the throne of Christ&rsquo;s glory. At His coming back, Christ will sit on the throne of His glory where all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. Those who are regarded as sheep will be transferred into the millennium, and those who are considered as goats will enter into the eternal fire. Finally, the dead unbelievers will be judged by Christ after the millennium. All the dead will be judged at the great white throne. They will be condemned by the Lord for their evil deeds, and then they will perish because of their unbelief, not having their names written in the book of life.</p>
<p>Three of the five judgments are concerned with the believers. As believers, we were judged in Christ on the cross. Now we are under God&rsquo;s family judgment, which is for our correction and transformation. Finally, we will be judged at the judgment seat of Christ in the air so that we may be recompensed for the things we have done, according to what we have practiced, whether good or bad. At that time we will give an account of ourselves to God concerning how we lived before the Lord and what kind of work we did for the Lord after we were saved. The Lord will then settle accounts with us. When we are examined by the Lord, He will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of our heart so that we may receive praise from God. He will also render to each of us according to our work. Some believers will receive a reward, but some will receive a punishment.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider the believers&rsquo; being called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb and being His bride in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. BEING CALLED<br />
TO THE MARRIAGE DINNER OF THE LAMB<br />
AND BEING HIS BRIDE</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the overcoming believers, those who are rewarded at the judgment seat of Christ, will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. These called ones will also be Christ&rsquo;s bride. Therefore, at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming believers. This is spoken of in Revelation 19:7-9. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;Let us rejoice and exult, and let us give the glory to Him, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; The words <em>His wife</em> refer to the church (Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32), the bride of Christ (John 3:29). However, according to Revelation 19:8-9, during the millennium the wife, the bride of Christ, will consist only of the overcoming believers, whereas the bride, the wife, in 21:2 is composed of all the saved saints after the millennium for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Marriage of the Lamb<br />
Being the Issue<br />
of the Completion of God&rsquo;s Economy</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the overcoming believers will be the bride of Christ. The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will surely be attained at the end of this age. Then the bride, consisting of the overcoming believers, will be ready.</p>
<p>Although the concept of the marriage of Christ and His bride is foreign to most Christians, we need to emphasize it so that all the believers will know that Christ as the Lamb needs a wedding. Our position is that of the bride, and the position of the coming Christ is that of the Bridegroom. The Gospel of John reveals that Christ is the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world (1:29) and also that He is the Bridegroom who came to have the bride (3:29). Christ&rsquo;s goal is to gain us to be His bride. The book of Revelation presents Christ our Redeemer as the Lamb and as the coming Bridegroom. As the Bridegroom, He must have a wedding. We are on earth preparing to become the bride to meet Him, and He is on the throne in the third heaven prepared to come as the Bridegroom to meet us. Thus, He is coming as the Bridegroom, and we are going as the bride. The bride and the Bridegroom will meet neither in heaven nor on earth but in the air. When we meet Him in the air, we will have a wedding.</p>
<p>The marriage of the Lamb will come after the rapture of the majority of the believers (1 Thes. 4:15-17) and also after the judgment of the believers (2 Cor. 5:10). After all the raptures and before the wedding, there will be the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ to determine which believers will be qualified for the marriage dinner of the Lamb. If we are rewarded at the judgment seat of Christ, we will be called to the marriage dinner. However, if we are not rewarded but instead are disapproved by the Lord, we will not be called to His marriage dinner. Those who are chosen at the judgment seat to be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb will be both the guests at the feast and also the bride; they will be a corporate bride.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Overcoming Believers<br />
as the Bride of Christ Being Called<br />
to the Marriage Dinner of the Lamb</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Bride Having Made Herself Ready</h2>
<p>In John 3:29 John the Baptist declared, &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom.&rdquo; Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. Furthermore, the overcomers are not separate individuals but a corporate bride. For this, building is needed. We need not only to mature in life but also to be built up together as one bride.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Overcoming Saints Being Clothed<br />
with Christ as Fine Linen, Bright and Clean</h2>
<h2 class="head4">a. Being the Righteousnesses of the Saints</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:8 says, &ldquo;It was given to her that she should be clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints.&rdquo; The word <em>righteousnesses</em> in this verse is plural and can also be translated as &ldquo;righteous acts.&rdquo; These righteousnesses do not refer to Christ as our righteousness, whom we received for our salvation (1 Cor. 1:30). The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective and enables us to meet the requirement of the righteous God. The righteousnesses of the overcoming saints in Revelation 19:8 are subjective (Phil. 3:9) and enable them to meet the requirements of the overcoming Christ. Hence, the fine linen indicates our overcoming life, our overcoming living. The fine linen is the Christ whom we live out of our being.</p>
<h2 class="head4">b. Being the Wedding Garment<br />
in Matthew 22:11-12</h2>
<p>The fine linen with which the overcoming believers are clothed is equal to the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, the believers need two garments&mdash;one for their salvation and one for their reward. For our salvation we need a robe to cover us. This robe is the robe that was put on the prodigal son in Luke 15. Upon his return, the prodigal son said to his father, &ldquo;I have sinned against heaven and before you; I am no longer worthy to be called your son&rdquo; (v. 21). But the father said to his slaves, &ldquo;Bring out quickly the best robe and put it on him&rdquo; (v. 22). This robe signifies Christ as our righteousness for us to be justified by God in His presence. All believers in Christ have this robe, the first robe, Christ as our righteousness, our justification, which enables us to stand before the righteous God.</p>
<p>However, we also need the second garment, which is the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12 and the fine linen in Revelation 19:8. This garment is not for our salvation; rather, it is for our reward and qualifies us to attend the wedding feast of the Lamb. The first garment qualifies us to meet God for our salvation; the second garment qualifies us to meet Christ for our reward. The second garment is the work of the Holy Spirit within us. It is the very Christ whom we live and who is expressed through us in our daily living. This is the righteousnesses of the saints (v. 8).</p>
<h2 class="head4">c. Being the Surpassing Righteousness<br />
in Matthew 5:20</h2>
<p>The second garment is also the surpassing righteousness in Matthew 5:20. In this verse the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; This righteousness is not objective righteousness, the Christ whom we receive as our robe for our salvation. It is subjective righteousness, the Christ whom we live out as our daily living. In Christ, who is our righteousness, we have been justified and saved. But after receiving Christ, we need to live Him out. We need to live by Christ so that He becomes our subjective righteousness. This subjective righteousness qualifies us to participate in the marriage dinner of the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head4">d. Being the White Garments<br />
in Revelation 3:4-5 and 18</h2>
<p>Revelation 3:4-5 and 18 speak of white garments. In verses 4 and 5 the Lord said to the church in Sardis that those &ldquo;who have not defiled their garments...will walk with Me in white&rdquo; and that the overcomers will be clothed in &ldquo;white garments.&rdquo; This refers to the garment for the wedding feast. In verse 18 the Lord advised the church in Laodicea to buy from Him &ldquo;white garments.&rdquo; These verses show that the second garment is emphasized in the book of Revelation. If we do not have this garment&mdash;the fine linen, bright and clean&mdash;we will miss the marriage dinner of the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Blessed Are the Overcoming Saints<br />
Who Are Called to the Marriage Dinner<br />
of the Lamb as His Bride</h2>
<p>Revelation 19:9 says, &ldquo;Blessed are they who are called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb.&rdquo; The marriage dinner of the Lamb is the wedding feast in Matthew 22:2. Only the overcomers will be called to the marriage dinner as a reward to them; not all the saved ones will participate in it. The five foolish virgins in Matthew 25:8-13 will miss the marriage dinner. However, after being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity. Hence, to be called, invited to the marriage dinner of Christ, which will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium, is to be blessed. The overcoming believers, those who will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb, will also be the bride of the Lamb. This means that the bride and the guests will be the same persons. Therefore, at His coming back Christ will marry the overcoming believers as His bride.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation the overcoming believers will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb and will be the bride of Christ. The marriage of the Lamb is the issue of the completion of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. God&rsquo;s economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through the redemption of Christ and the divine life. By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will surely be attained at the end of this age.</p>
<p>The overcoming believers, those who have made themselves ready, will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb and will be His bride. The readiness of the bride depends on the maturity in life of the overcomers. These overcoming saints will be clothed with Christ as the &ldquo;fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints&rdquo; (Rev. 19:8). The fine linen indicates our overcoming life, our overcoming living, which is the Christ whom we live out of our being. The fine linen with which the overcoming believers are clothed is equal to the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12. According to the revelation of the Scriptures, the believers need two garments&mdash;one for salvation and one for reward. For salvation, we need a robe to cover us. This robe is signified by the robe put on the prodigal son in Luke 15. However, we also need the second garment, which is the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11-12 and the fine linen in Revelation 19:8, for our reward. This second garment qualifies us to attend the marriage dinner of the Lamb. The second garment is the work of the Holy Spirit within us. It is the very Christ whom we live and who is expressed through us in our daily living. This garment is the righteousnesses of the saints in Revelation 19:8, the surpassing righteousness in Matthew 5:20, and the white garments in Revelation 3:4-5 and 18. If we do not have this second garment&mdash;the fine linen, bright and clean&mdash;we will miss the marriage dinner of the Lamb. Blessed are those who are called to the marriage dinner, the wedding feast, of the Lamb. Only the overcomers, not all the saved ones, will be invited to the wedding feast as a reward to them. Furthermore, the marriage dinner will usher the overcoming believers into the enjoyment of the millennium.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will see that in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation the overcoming believers will be the heavenly armies following Christ, who is called Faithful and True, the Word of God, and King of kings and Lord of lords.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. BEING THE HEAVENLY ARMIES FOLLOWING CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation the overcoming believers will be the heavenly armies following Christ, who is called Faithful and True, the Word of God, and King of kings and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:11-16). Verse 14 speaks of the overcomers as the heavenly armies, saying, &ldquo;The armies which are in heaven followed Him on white horses, dressed in fine linen, white and clean.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Name of Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Called Faithful and True</h2>
<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse, and He who sits on it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.&rdquo; The overcoming believers will follow Christ, who is called Faithful and True. Christ is faithful both to God and to those who believe in Him. In His faithfulness He defeats and destroys those who oppose God and persecute the believers. Christ will be faithful in destroying Antichrist and true in carrying out God&rsquo;s economy, and in righteousness He will judge and make war with Antichrist and the rebels who follow him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Called the Word of God</h2>
<p>As the One who defeats Antichrist, Christ is called the Word of God (v. 13). The Word of God is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. As the Word of God, Christ speaks for God not only by imparting life as grace into God&rsquo;s chosen people (John 1:1, 4, 14) but also by executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon Antichrist and his followers. Even as the Lord fights, He speaks for God and expresses God. God is righteous and sovereign; He is also a God of order and cannot tolerate disorder and rebellion. As Christ fights against Antichrist, He will declare that God is sovereign, righteous, and orderly, that God is over everyone, and that He does not tolerate rebellion against His authority. Therefore, when Christ fights against Antichrist, He fights as the Word of God, and His fighting will be a powerful speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Called King of Kings and Lord of Lords</h2>
<p>Christ is also called King of kings and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). The fact that this name will be written on Christ&rsquo;s garment and His thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all. The garment signifies Christ&rsquo;s attributes, His character, especially His righteousness in His humanity, and the thigh signifies His standing strength, His stability. His title <em>King of kings and Lord of lords</em> is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Heavenly Armies Following Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being His Called, Chosen, and Faithful Ones<br />
and Being His Bride Called<br />
to His Marriage Dinner</h2>
<p>Speaking concerning Christ as the Lamb, Revelation 17:14 says, &ldquo;He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and they who are with Him, the called and chosen and faithful.&rdquo; This verse shows that those who are with the Lamb, the armies following Christ, are called, chosen, and faithful. Notice that the word <em>chosen</em> is after the word <em>called.</em> To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life. Today many are called, but in the future few will be chosen (Matt. 22:14). We all have been called. However, in order to be among the chosen in the future, we need to live an overcoming life today. The chosen ones must be those faithful to the Lord who will become His army.</p>
<p>We must be impressed with the fact that to be called is one thing and to be chosen is another. Those who will follow the Lord as the King of kings and Lord of lords will not only be called but also chosen. Although we have the assurance that we have been called, we do not yet have the assurance that we have been chosen. This will be decided at the judgment seat of Christ. After we have been raptured, we will stand before the Lord at the judgment seat, and He will decide whether or not we are qualified to be chosen. Only those who are chosen will be His armies to fight against Antichrist.</p>
<p>The armies consist of those who are both the bride and the guests called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-16). Hence, the guests invited to the marriage dinner and the bride are the same. The bride consists of the called guests, and the called guests make up the bride. After the wedding all the guests will become the army. Those in the Lord&rsquo;s armies will be &ldquo;dressed in fine linen, white and clean&rdquo; (v. 14). This fine linen is the second garment of the overcomers, which qualifies them both to attend the marriage dinner of the Lamb and to fight with Christ against His enemy. Thus, the wedding garment becomes the fighting garment. The second garment qualifies us not only to attend the wedding but also to be in the army. The overcomers who follow Christ to fight against His enemy will be a properly formed heavenly army.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Fighting against Antichrist<br />
and the False Prophet and Their Armies</h2>
<p>The heavenly armies following the Lord will fight against Antichrist and the false prophet and their armies and will destroy them (vv. 19-21). Verse 19 speaks of Christ&rsquo;s enemies: &ldquo;I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army.&rdquo; Christ&rsquo;s enemies are the beast, Antichrist (undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet), and the kings of the earth and their armies. In particular, the kings of the earth include the ten kings under Antichrist (17:12-14), and the armies include the two hundred million horsemen from the rising of the sun (9:14-16; 16:12). The beast and the kings of the earth and their armies will gather together to make war with Him who sits on the horse and with His army (19:19).</p>
<p>Christ and His armies will defeat Antichrist and his armies. The beast will be seized, and with him the false prophet, who in his presence did signs by which he deceived those who received the mark of the beast and those who worshipped his image. These two will be cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone (v. 20). Antichrist and the false prophet will be the first to be cast into the lake of fire. The rest will be &ldquo;killed with the sword which proceeds out of the mouth of Him who sits on the horse&rdquo; (v. 21). This is Christ as the King of kings and Lord of lords with His armies defeating Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Destroying Antichrist and the False Prophet<br />
and Their Armies at Armageddon</h2>
<p>Antichrist and the false prophet with their armies will form the strongest force against God, fighting directly with God. God in Christ as His embodiment will come with all His chosen and faithful ones to fight physically against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies. This will take place at Armageddon.</p>
<p>At the end of the great tribulation three unclean spirits like frogs will come out of the mouths of the dragon, Antichrist, and the false prophet (16:13). These unclean spirits &ldquo;are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty&rdquo; (v. 14), stirring them up to send forth their forces to persecute God&rsquo;s people. The unclean spirits who stir up this rebellion should be in the heavenlies, but having become frogs, they can move about only on the earth. This indicates that Satan and his power to act will be limited to the earth. The kings on earth will be gathered to the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon (v. 16). All the kings and their forces, including the two hundred million horsemen spoken of in 9:14-16, will come forward to participate in the war at Armageddon.</p>
<p>The war at Armageddon will be the last war among mankind before the millennium. In that war Satan&rsquo;s intention will be to destroy Israel (Zech. 14:2) and to fight against Christ and His army. For this he will use all of rebellious mankind (Rev. 17:12-14; 19:11-19). As revealed in Zechariah 13 and 14, in the great tribulation Antichrist and his armies will slaughter two-thirds of the people of Israel. Of the one-third remaining in the land, most will probably be in the area of Jerusalem. Out of this one-third, half the city will be captured by Antichrist. In His mercy God will preserve the remaining half (13:7&mdash;14:2). Antichrist will attempt to destroy them also; however, Jehovah as Christ will come with His saints (14:3, 5) and go forth to fight against and defeat Antichrist and his followers, the nations (Joel 3:11; Rev. 17:14; 19:11-21). Christ and His chosen overcomers will defeat and destroy them all at Armageddon (vv. 20-21; Micah 4:11-13; Zeph. 3:8; Zech. 14:3, 12-15; 12:4, 9) and will save the nation of Israel (vv. 3-8; 14:4-5; Joel 3:14-17). This is the treading of the winepress of the fury of God recorded in Revelation 14:17-20, Isaiah 63:1-6, and Joel 3:9-13.</p>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation the overcoming believers will be called to the marriage dinner to be the bride, and after the marriage, they will become the heavenly armies following Christ to destroy Antichrist and his followers. May we be encouraged to become the called, chosen, and faithful ones who in that day will be approved by the Lord to participate in His glorious army, following Him to defeat God&rsquo;s enemies and bring in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the overcoming believers will be the heavenly armies following Christ. Christ is called Faithful and True. He is faithful to destroy Antichrist and true in carrying out God&rsquo;s economy. Christ is called the Word of God. The Word of God is the definition, explanation, and expression of God. As the Word of God, Christ speaks for God not only by imparting life as grace into God&rsquo;s chosen people but also by executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon Antichrist and his followers. Christ is also called King of kings and Lord of lords. The fact that this name will be written upon Christ&rsquo;s garment and His thigh indicates that it will be openly revealed and known to all and is exhibited in His righteousness and stability.</p>
<p>The heavenly armies following Christ are His called, chosen, and faithful ones and His bride called to His marriage dinner. To be called is to be saved, but to be chosen is to be approved by the Lord on the basis of an overcoming life. Many are called today, but few will be chosen in the future. We all have been called, but in order to be among the chosen in the future, we need to live an overcoming life today. Only those who are chosen will be His armies to fight against Antichrist. The armies consist of those who are both the bride and the guests called, invited to the marriage dinner of the Lamb. Hence, the guests and the bride are the same. The bride consists of the called guests, and the called guests make up the bride. After the wedding all the guests will become the army. The Lord&rsquo;s armies will be dressed in fine linen. This fine linen qualifies them both to attend the wedding dinner and to fight with Christ against His enemies. Christ&rsquo;s enemies are the beast, Antichrist (undoubtedly including his associate, the false prophet), and the kings of the earth and their armies. God Himself in Christ as His embodiment will come with all His chosen and faithful ones to fight against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies, and He will defeat them at Armageddon. The beast and the false prophet will be seized, and they will be cast alive into the lake of fire, which burns with brimstone.</p>
<p>The war at Armageddon will be the last war among mankind before the millennium. In that war Satan&rsquo;s intention will be to destroy Israel and to fight against Christ and His army. For this, in the great tribulation Satan will use all of rebellious mankind to attempt to slaughter the nation of Israel and even to destroy them. However, Christ and His chosen overcomers will defeat and destroy them at Armageddon and will save Israel. May we be encouraged to become the called, chosen, and faithful ones, who in that day will be approved by the Lord to participate in His glorious army, following Him to defeat God&rsquo;s enemies and bring in God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen that in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification, the believers will be glorified, redeemed in their body, raptured, and judged at the judgment seat of Christ. Furthermore, the overcoming believers will be called to the marriage dinner of the Lamb and will be the heavenly armies following the Lord to fight against Antichrist. In this lesson we will see that, as the last aspect of the believers&rsquo; future in the completing of God&rsquo;s salvation, the overcoming believers will participate in the coming kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. PARTICIPATING IN THE COMING KINGDOM&mdash;<br />
THE MANIFESTATION OF THE KINGDOM<br />
OF THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>After Christ and His heavenly armies fight against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies, the kingdom will be brought in. Then the overcoming believers will participate in the coming kingdom, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens during the millennium.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being in the Kingdom of the Father&mdash;<br />
the Heavenly Part of the Millennium</h2>
<p>The millennium will have an earthly part and a heavenly part. The earthly part will be the kingdom of the Messiah (2 Sam. 7:13), the tabernacle of David (Acts 15:16), the restored kingdom of Israel (1:6), and the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41; Rev. 11:15). Christ as the Son of Man, David&rsquo;s royal descendant, will be the King over the children of Israel. The heavenly part of the millennium will be the kingdom of the Father. This is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers. In the millennium the overcoming believers will be in the heavenly part of the kingdom and will reign with Christ over the earthly part.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being the Righteous,<br />
the Sons of the Kingdom Shining Forth<br />
as the Sun</h2>
<p>The believers are sons of God the Father, and God is light (1 John 1:5; 1 Tim. 6:16). Because of this, today the believers shine as lamps (Matt. 5:14-16), but in the coming age the overcomers will shine as the sun. Matthew 13:43 says, &ldquo;The righteous will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&rdquo; In this verse <em>the righteous</em> refers to the sons of the kingdom (v. 38). They will shine like the sun because they will have the surpassing righteousness (5:20). This righteousness is the indwelling Christ lived out of them so that they may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. In the heavenly part of the millennium the overcoming believers will enjoy the Father as light, and they will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of the Father. They will be righteous to such an extent that they will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of the Father.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Drinking the Cup of the New Covenant<br />
New with the Lord</h2>
<p>After His coming back, the Lord will drink the cup of the new covenant new with the overcoming believers in the heavenly part of the millennium. When the Lord was establishing the table, He said, &ldquo;I shall by no means drink of this product of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of My Father&rdquo; (26:29). This word indicates that from the time He established the table, the Lord would be away from the believers physically and would not drink of the fruit of the vine with them until He drinks it new with them in the Father&rsquo;s kingdom. The Lord&rsquo;s promise in this verse will be fulfilled in the kingdom of the Father during the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Feasting with the Old Testament Overcomers</h2>
<p>In the kingdom of the Father the overcoming believers will feast with the Old Testament overcomers. This is the Lord&rsquo;s promise in Matthew 8:11: &ldquo;I say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will recline at table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; It will be in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens that the overcoming Gentile believers will feast with the Old Testament overcomers, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Inheriting the Kingdom as a Reward</h2>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 6:10 Paul speaks of inheriting the kingdom of God. The word <em>inherit</em> in this verse implies enjoyment. To inherit the coming kingdom means to enjoy the kingdom. To inherit the kingdom is not just to enter into the kingdom; it is to receive the kingdom as a reward for our enjoyment. The coming kingdom will be a joyful inheritance to the overcomers as their reward and as their enjoyment with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being the Father&rsquo;s Delight to Give<br />
to the Believers</h2>
<p>In Luke 12:32 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, little flock, because your Father has been well pleased to give you the kingdom.&rdquo; The Father delights to give the believers the coming kingdom as an inheritance reward.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being God&rsquo;s Promise to Those Who Love Him</h2>
<p>James 2:5 says, &ldquo;Listen, my beloved brothers: Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which He promised to those who love Him?&rdquo; We cannot receive the kingdom as a reward simply by believing and receiving salvation. In order to inherit the coming kingdom as a reward, we need not only to believe in the Lord but also to love God for our overcoming, because the kingdom is God&rsquo;s promise to those who love Him.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being an Inheritance<br />
in the Kingdom of Christ and of God</h2>
<p>Ephesians 5:5 speaks of the believers&rsquo; &ldquo;inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.&rdquo; The kingdom of Christ is the millennium (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 16:28) and also the kingdom of God (13:41, 43). The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God (John 3:5), and they are in the church life, living in the kingdom of God today (Rom. 14:17). However, not all the believers will have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God, because the kingdom of Christ and of God does not refer to the kingdom today in the church life but to the manifestation of the kingdom in the coming millennium. Only the overcoming ones will inherit the kingdom during the millennium; that is, they will have an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. The millennium will be a kingdom in a way that is more practical than what we are experiencing in the church today. Only in the millennium will the kingdom of Christ become the kingdom of God. However, the defeated believers will have no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God in the coming age.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Being an Incentive to Live an Overcoming Life</h2>
<p>The promise of inheriting the kingdom should be an incentive for all believers to live an overcoming life on earth today. Paul warned the believers in Galatia that those who practice the works of the flesh &ldquo;will not inherit the kingdom of God&rdquo; (Gal. 5:21). &ldquo;The works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects, envyings, bouts of drunkenness, carousings, and things like these, of which I tell you beforehand, even as I have said before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God&rdquo; (vv. 19-21). Those believers who practice the works of the flesh will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Inheriting Eternal Life and<br />
Having a Fuller Enjoyment of the Divine Life</h2>
<p>When the overcoming believers participate in the coming kingdom, they will inherit eternal life and thereby have a fuller enjoyment of the divine life (Matt. 19:29). To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age (Luke 18:29-30) with a fuller enjoyment of the divine life in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. In the church life today we are enjoying the divine life, the eternal life, but this enjoyment is not in full. In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens the overcomers will enjoy the eternal life in a fuller way.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Being Rewarded with the Crown of Life</h2>
<p>To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded with the crown of life. In Revelation 2:10 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.&rdquo; A crown in New Testament usage always denotes a prize that is in addition to salvation. The crown of life, as a prize to the overcomers, denotes the overcoming strength that is the power of the resurrection life (Phil. 3:10). It also signifies that the overcomers have attained to the out-resurrection from the dead, that is, the outstanding resurrection (v. 11). To be rewarded with the crown of life in the coming kingdom will surely be a fuller enjoyment of eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Being Rewarded<br />
to Eat of the Tree of Life<br />
in the Paradise of God</h2>
<p>To participate in the coming kingdom is also to be rewarded to eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God. Revelation 2:7 says, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, to eat of the tree of life in the Paradise of God refers to the particular enjoyment of Christ as our life supply in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom, because this is a promise of reward made by the Lord to His overcomers. The enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people, whereas the particular enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life in the New Jerusalem in the coming millennial kingdom will be a reward given only to the overcoming believers. If we overcome all the distractions in the church&rsquo;s degradation to enjoy Christ as the tree of life in the church today, we will be rewarded with the eating of the tree of life in the Paradise of God in the coming age. This will also be a fuller enjoyment of the eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Being Rewarded<br />
to Have Their Names Remain<br />
in the Book of Life</h2>
<p>The believers&rsquo; participation in the coming kingdom also includes their being rewarded to have their names remain in the book of life. Revelation 3:5 says, &ldquo;He who overcomes will be clothed thus, in white garments, and I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.&rdquo; That a name is erased out of the book of life indicates that that name has already been written in the book of life. The book of life is a divine record of the names of those who partake of the blessings that God has prepared for them. The names of all the saints chosen by God and predestinated to partake of these blessings are written in this book (Luke 10:20).</p>
<p>The blessings that God has prepared for His chosen ones are in three stages: the church, the millennial kingdom, and eternity. The blessings in the stage of the church, such as forgiveness, redemption, regeneration, eternal life, and the divine nature, are the initial portions. All God&rsquo;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life have a share in these initial portions to begin their spiritual life. If we cooperate with God&rsquo;s supplying grace, we will mature in life in the church age, and this earlier maturity in life will constitute a prize with which the Lord will reward us at His coming back. That reward will be the entrance into the millennial kingdom and participation in the divine blessings in that stage, such as the joy and rest of the Lord (Matt. 25:21, 23; Heb. 4:9-11) and reigning over the nations (Rev. 2:26-27; 20:4-6). However, those believers who will not cooperate with His grace to mature in life in the church age will not be ready at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to enter into the millennial kingdom and share in the divine blessings of that age as a prize. Therefore, during the millennial kingdom their names will be erased from the book of life. After being disciplined by the Lord and growing in life unto maturity during the millennial kingdom, they will share in the divine blessings in the stage of eternity, such as the eternal priesthood with God&rsquo;s eternal presence, the eternal kingship (22:3-5), the New Jerusalem, the tree of life (v. 14), and the water of life (v. 17). Then their names should again be written in the book of life. This means that all God&rsquo;s chosen ones whose names are written in the book of life and who have been brought into the participation of the divine blessings in the stage of the church will &ldquo;by no means perish forever&rdquo; (John 10:28); that is, they will by no means lose the divine blessing of eternity. But some, who will not cooperate with the Lord in the church age, will be dispensationally disciplined by the Lord during the millennial kingdom and will miss the divine blessings in that stage. However, the names of those who have lived an overcoming life in the church age will remain in the book of life during the coming age of the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the crown of life, the tree of life, and the book of life in Revelation indicates that in the manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy the different aspects of eternal life in a fuller way. This enjoyment of eternal life will be fuller than the enjoyment that we have in the church life today.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Gaining the Soul,<br />
Saving the Soul, and Enjoying<br />
the Salvation of the Soul</h2>
<p>In their participation in the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will also gain the soul, save the soul, and enjoy the salvation of the soul. First Peter 1:5 says that there is &ldquo;a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time.&rdquo; Verse 9 speaks of receiving the end of our faith, the salvation of our souls. Our spirit has been saved through regeneration (John 3:5-6). Our body will be saved, redeemed, through the coming transfiguration (Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:23). Our soul will be saved from sufferings into the full enjoyment of the Lord at His unveiling, His coming back. In Matthew 10:39 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it.&rdquo; To find the soul-life is to allow the soul to have its enjoyment and to not suffer. To lose the soul-life is to cause the soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment. If we, the believers, allow our soul to suffer the loss of its enjoyment in this age for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, not loving our soul, that is, our self, and if we live by the Lord and according to His standard, then when He comes back He will reward us with the kingdom, and we will have no problems, sorrows, or sufferings in our soul. However, if we are defeated believers, we will be punished during the kingdom age, and that punishment will involve our soul, with the gnashing of teeth as a sign of suffering in our soul. In Luke 9:24 the Lord said, &ldquo;Whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake, this one shall save it.&rdquo; To save the soul in this verse is the same as finding the soul in Matthew 10:39.</p>
<p>Many believers are loose or indifferent in following the Lord and only want things such as greatness and prosperity. This is to love the soul for the enjoyment of the soul. Such believers will lose the soul when the Lord comes back. But some believers are willing to follow the Lord in this age, to suffer and be dishonored for the Lord&rsquo;s name. This is to suffer in the soul and thereby lose the soul. Such believers will gain the soul and enjoy the salvation of the soul when the Lord comes back (1 Pet. 1:5, 9) and will be saved from the realm of suffering into a realm of comfort. This is also referred to in Hebrews 10:39: &ldquo;We are not of those who shrink back to ruin but of those who have faith to the gaining of the soul.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Participating in the Joy of the Lord</h2>
<p>The Lord promised the overcoming believers that they will participate in the joy of the Lord. In Matthew 25 the Lord Jesus twice said, &ldquo;Enter into the joy of your master&rdquo; (vv. 21, 23). The joy of the Lord signifies the enjoyment of the Lord in the coming kingdom. This refers to inward satisfaction, not to outward position. When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will enjoy the earth. Satan will be bound, and Christ will recover the earth; the entire earth will be under His reign. By repossessing the earth, the Lord will have His enjoyment. Then He will invite His followers, His partners, to participate in this enjoyment, to enter into His joy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Reigning with Christ</h2>
<p>In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ. Revelation 20:4 says, &ldquo;They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years,&rdquo; and verse 6 says, &ldquo;They will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with Him for a thousand years.&rdquo; Furthermore, 2 Timothy 2:12 says, &ldquo;If we endure, we will also reign with Him.&rdquo; These verses indicate that in the coming manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ as His co-kings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Ruling Over the Nations</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Exercising the Authority of Christ</h2>
<p>The Lord promised the overcoming believers that they will rule over the nations in the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. This promise is to the believers who overcome and keep the Lord&rsquo;s works until the end. Therefore, the Lord will give them authority over the nations, and they will shepherd the nations with an iron rod (Rev. 2:26-27). In Psalm 2:9 God gave Christ authority to rule over the nations. In the coming kingdom Christ will give the same authority to the overcoming believers so that they can exercise His authority to shepherd the nations with Him. This is a prize to the overcomers from the Lord in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Reigning Differing in Extent</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s teaching concerning faithfulness in Luke 19:11-27, He indicates that the overcoming believers will rule over the nations, having authority over ten cities or over five cities. Having authority over cities signifies the overcomers&rsquo; reigning over the nations (Rev. 2:26; 20:4, 6). Furthermore, this indicates that the overcoming believers&rsquo; reigning in the coming kingdom as a reward will differ in extent.</p><h2 class="head2">H. Ruling Over All the Possessions of the Lord</h2>
<p>Finally, in the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will be appointed by the Lord to rule over all the possessions of the Lord (Matt. 24:47). This is the reward that the Lord gives to His faithful slaves in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>After Christ and His heavenly armies fight against Antichrist, the false prophet, and their armies, the kingdom will be brought in. Then the overcoming believers will participate in the coming kingdom, which will be the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens during the millennium. The millennium will have an earthly part and a heavenly part. The earthly part will be the kingdom of the Messiah, the tabernacle of David, the restored kingdom of Israel, and the kingdom of the Son of Man where Christ as the Son of Man, David&rsquo;s royal descendant, will be the King over the children of Israel. The heavenly part of the millennium will be the kingdom of the Father. This is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens as a reward to the overcomers.</p>
<p>In the heavenly part of the millennium the overcoming believers will reign with Christ over the earthly part. The overcoming believers are the righteous, the sons of the kingdom, shining forth like the sun. In the heavenly part of the millennium the Lord will drink the cup of the new covenant new with the overcoming believers.</p>
<p>In the kingdom of the Father, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the overcoming believers will feast with the Old Testament overcomers, including Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>
<p>The overcoming believers will inherit the kingdom as a reward. The Father delights to give the believers the kingdom, which is His promise to those who love Him and is the overcomers&rsquo; inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. The overcoming believers will participate in the coming kingdom and inherit eternal life, thereby having a fuller enjoyment of the divine life. To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded with the crown of life and to eat of the tree life in the Paradise of God. The believers who inherit eternal life will also have their names remain in the book of life. The Lord&rsquo;s word concerning the crown of life, the tree of life, and the book of life indicates that in the manifestation of the kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy eternal life in different aspects in a fuller way. This enjoyment will be fuller than the enjoyment that we have in the church life today.</p>
<p>The overcoming believers will also gain the soul, save the soul, and enjoy the salvation of the soul. Some believers are willing to follow the Lord in this age, to suffer and be dishonored for the Lord&rsquo;s name, and to suffer in the soul and thereby lose the soul. Such believers will be saved from the realm of suffering into a realm of comfort when the Lord comes back. The Lord promised the overcoming believers that they will participate in the joy of the Lord. When Christ recovers the earth and the entire earth is under His reign, He will invite His followers, His partners, to participate in this enjoyment, to enter into His joy. In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will reign with Christ. They will exercise the authority of Christ to rule over the nations; they will also be appointed by the Lord to rule over all His possessions.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the previous eight lessons we covered the first aspect of the believers&rsquo; future in the completing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of glorification. In this lesson and the lesson following we will consider the second aspect of the believers&rsquo; future in the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<p>The entire revelation of the Bible is that God wants to dispense Himself into man and to be mingled with man to produce a marvelous entity with Himself as the content and with man as His expression. This marvelous entity is the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people. In eternity the believers will participate in this ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. This consummation is altogether related to the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is not a physical city; rather, it is a divine and spiritual sign, signifying the ultimate consummation of the Divine Trinity dispensing Himself into His chosen people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. ENJOYING THE ETERNAL LIFE TO THE FULLEST</h2>
<p>In the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the New Jerusalem, the believers are destined to enjoy the eternal life to the fullest extent. In the church life we have the enjoyment of the eternal life. In the coming age, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium, the overcoming believers will enjoy the eternal life in a fuller way. Eventually, in the New Jerusalem in eternity we will enjoy the eternal life to the fullest. From this we see that the enjoyment of the eternal life is of three stages: the full enjoyment in the church age, the fuller enjoyment in the kingdom age, and the fullest enjoyment in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. In Eternity</h2>
<p>In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.&rdquo; This indicates that in eternity the believers will enjoy the eternal life to the fullest extent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In the New Heaven and New Earth</h2>
<p>After the millennium the old heaven and the old earth will pass away through fire and will be renewed into the new heaven and new earth (2 Pet. 3:10-13), into which the New Jerusalem will come for God&rsquo;s eternal expression. The believers&rsquo; enjoyment of the eternal life to the fullest extent will be in the new heaven and new earth. The new heaven and new earth (Isa. 65:17; 66:22) with the New Jerusalem as the center will be the new universe, which God will renew out of the old heaven and old earth. Although the heaven and earth created by God have become old because of Satan&rsquo;s corruption, God&rsquo;s purpose in creating heaven and earth cannot be stopped. On the one hand, God will exercise His almighty power to judge the Satan-corrupted old heaven and old earth; on the other hand, He will renew the judged old heaven and old earth into the new heaven and new earth.</p>
<p>Eventually, the old creation with the old heaven and the old earth will pass away. Everything of the old creation will be over. This is the issue, the result, of Christ&rsquo;s death. Christ&rsquo;s death as the grain of wheat terminated the old creation and released the divine life to germinate the new creation (John 12:24). The new creation is eventually realized in its ultimate consummation in Revelation 21 and 22, where the old heaven and the old earth have passed away and the new heaven and the new earth have come in. This is a new beginning with a new universe, and the New Jerusalem is in the center of this new universe. At that time the old heaven and old earth will be renewed into a new universe suitable for God to manifest the accomplishment of His eternal purpose and in which He can express Himself eternally and fully. In this new and eternal environment the believers will enjoy the eternal life to the fullest extent.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Only Those Who Are Written in the Lamb&rsquo;s<br />
Book of Life Entering into the New Jerusalem</h2>
<p>Revelation 21:27 says that only &ldquo;those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life&rdquo; will enter into the New Jerusalem. This assures us that all the believers in Christ will be there, for we are those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Those Who Enter into the New Jerusalem<br />
Being Given to Drink of the Spring<br />
of the Water of Life</h2>
<p>Those who enter into the New Jerusalem will be given to drink of the spring of the water of life. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.&rdquo; According to 22:1, in the middle of the street of the New Jerusalem is a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. The water of life is the life-giving Spirit as our eternal drink. This eternal drink is altogether transparent, bright as crystal. As we drink this eternal Spirit, our entire being becomes crystal clear.</p>
<p>The life-giving Spirit is the Triune God flowing out to be our eternal drink. The river of water of life is a symbol of the processed Triune God in Christ as the life-giving Spirit (John 7:38-39; 1 Cor. 15:45) flowing out Himself into us, the redeemed people, to saturate us and make us the constituents of the New Jerusalem. All those who believe into the processed Triune God are already enjoying this spring of water of life. In eternity all the redeemed people will still need the supply of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity. They will still need to drink the water of life as their eternal portion. In the New Jerusalem the Triune God Himself will be flowing out as the water of life for our supply eternally.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Having the Right to Eat of the Tree of Life</h2>
<p>After his creation, man was put before the tree of life (Gen. 2:8-9), indicating that man was privileged to partake of the tree of life. But due to the fall of man, the tree of life was closed to man by God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness (3:24). Through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which has fulfilled all the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness, the way to the tree of life has been opened again to the believers (Heb. 10:19-20). Hence, Revelation 22:14 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city.&rdquo; Those who wash their robes in the redeeming blood of Christ, that is, keep their conduct clean through the washing of the blood of the Lamb, have the right to enjoy the tree of life. The tree of life is nothing less than Christ, the Son of God, the redeeming Lamb, as our life supply. This tree is rich, fresh, and refreshing. We have been redeemed so that we may have the right to come to the tree of life, which is Christ with all the riches of the divine life. In the millennial kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their reward (2:7). In the New Jerusalem all the believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion.</p>
<p>The water of life and the tree of life both signify that the Triune God will be dispensed into us continuously as our life supply for eternity. The water of life signifies the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, and the tree of life signifies Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. The fact that the tree of life grows on the two sides of the river of the water of life indicates that the embodiment of the Triune God, who is Christ, is always with the all-inclusive Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, to be our life supply dispensed into us. In this way the believers will enjoy the eternal life to the fullest extent. The flowing of the water of life with the tree of life is the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people as their life and life supply in fullness for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. TOGETHER WITH THE OLD TESTAMENT SAINTS,<br />
BEING THE COMPONENTS OF<br />
THE HOLY CITY, NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the redeemed and perfected saints in both the Old Testament and the New Testament throughout the generations. Revelation 21:12 says that the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed on the gates of the New Jerusalem. This indicates that the Old Testament saints are components of the New Jerusalem. Verse 14 says that the names of the twelve apostles are on the foundations of the wall of the New Jerusalem. This indicates that the New Testament believers also are components of the New Jerusalem. Therefore, in the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the New Testament believers together with the Old Testament saints will be the components of the holy city, New Jerusalem (v. 2).</p>
<p>The fact that the New Jerusalem is a living composition of the New Testament believers and the Old Testament saints proves that the holy city is not a physical entity. On the contrary, the New Jerusalem is a corporate person; it is the aggregate and totality of all God&rsquo;s redeemed people. This corporate person, this aggregate of the Old Testament saints and the New Testament believers, is the ultimate enlargement and consummation of the Father&rsquo;s house in John 14.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Coming Down out of Heaven from God</h2>
<p>After all God&rsquo;s redeemed saints have been raptured to the heavens, they will be the New Jerusalem, which will come down out of heaven from God. Revelation 21:2 says, &ldquo;I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.&rdquo; The New Jerusalem will come down to the new earth. This indicates that our dwelling place for eternity will not be heaven; our dwelling place will be the New Jerusalem on the new earth. Many believers want to go to heaven, but God loves to come down from heaven to the earth. Eventually, the New Jerusalem, which is something heavenly, will come down out of heaven from God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being the Bride, the Wife of the Lamb&mdash;<br />
Christ&rsquo;s Eternal Counterpart</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife of the Lamb (vv. 2, 9). According to the entire Bible, there is a divine romance between God the Creator, the Redeemer, who is the male, and His redeemed people, who are the female. For this reason, God repeatedly likens His chosen people to a spouse for His satisfaction in love (Isa. 54:6; Jer. 3:1; Ezek. 16:8; Hosea 2:19; 2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:31-32). As the wife of Christ, the New Jerusalem comes out of Christ to be His spouse, just as Eve came out of Adam and became his counterpart (Gen. 2:21-24). The New Jerusalem will first be the bride of Christ in the millennium for one thousand years, which is like one day (2 Pet. 3:8), and then will be His wife in the new heaven and new earth for eternity. The bride in the millennium will include only the overcoming saints (Rev. 3:12; 19:7-9), but the wife in the new heaven and new earth will include all the redeemed and regenerated sons of God (21:7).</p>
<p>The fact that the New Jerusalem is the bride, the wife of the Lamb, Christ&rsquo;s eternal counterpart, indicates that the New Jerusalem is a corporate person, the aggregate of God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. This also proves that the New Jerusalem is not a physical city.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being the Tabernacle of God&mdash;<br />
God&rsquo;s Eternal Habitation among Men (the Nations)</h2>
<p>In eternity the New Testament believers, together with the Old Testament saints, will be the tabernacle of God, God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place among men. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;I heard a loud voice out of the throne, saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they will be His peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.&rdquo; The tabernacle made by Moses was a type of this tabernacle (Exo. 25:8-9; Lev. 26:11). The type was first fulfilled in Christ as God&rsquo;s tabernacle among men (John 1:14) and will eventually be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This tabernacle will also be the eternal dwelling place of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. God, as the One who is embodied in Christ, will overshadow us with Himself (Rev. 7:15). Hence, the New Jerusalem will be a mutual habitation for both God and us.</p>
<p>In both the Old Testament and the New Testament God likens His chosen people to a dwelling place (Exo. 29:45-46; Num. 5:3; Ezek. 43:7, 9; Psa. 68:18; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Tim. 3:15). The New Jerusalem will be God&rsquo;s dwelling place among men for Him to rest and be expressed. God will live with men. <em>Men</em> in Revelation 21:3 refers not to the believers but to the nations (vv. 24, 26), the people living on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem. Hence, the New Jerusalem is not only the mutual habitation of God and the believers, but also God&rsquo;s tabernacle among the nations as His expression. God will tabernacle with the nations. They will be God&rsquo;s peoples, and God Himself will be with them and be their God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being Designed and Built by God</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is designed and built by God. Speaking of Abraham, Hebrews 11:10 says, &ldquo;He eagerly waited for the city which has the foundations, whose Architect and Builder is God.&rdquo; The word <em>Architect</em> indicates that God is a skillful designer and a top craftsman. To say that the New Jerusalem is a physical city depreciates God&rsquo;s wisdom and belittles Him as the eternal, wise Architect. If we realize that the New Jerusalem is a sign that signifies spiritual and divine things, we will begin to see the wisdom of God in this city. God is a wise Designer and Artificer who designs such a city to be a full manifestation of His multifarious wisdom (Eph. 3:10). Furthermore, in His wisdom God constructs the New Jerusalem by dispensing Himself as the Architect and Builder into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE SONS OF GOD BEING THE OVERCOMERS<br />
ENJOYING THE DIVINE SONSHIP TO THE FULLEST</h2>
<p>In the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity the believers will be the sons of God as the overcomers enjoying the divine sonship to the fullest. Revelation 21:7 says, &ldquo;He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be God to him, and he will be a son to Me.&rdquo; In this verse <em>overcomes</em> means to overcome by believing, as in 1 John 5:4-5. This overcoming qualifies all believers to participate in the New Jerusalem with all its enjoyment as the common portion of God&rsquo;s eternal salvation. As the sons of God in the New Jerusalem, the believers will enjoy the divine sonship to the fullest.</p>
<p>God has predestinated us to receive sonship. When we are born again, we receive the position of sons (John 20:17); that is, our spirit is in the sonship, and we have the spirit of the Son and the life of the Son in us; however, our soul and our body are not in the sonship. At present, we are undergoing the process of sonship. This sonship will continually spread outward from our spirit, sanctifying and transforming us, until it saturates our whole being and conforms us to the image of God&rsquo;s Son (Rom. 8:29). When the Lord Jesus comes back, even our physical body will be saturated with the sonship and be transfigured. At that time we will be brought wholly into sonship. Every part of our being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;will be in the completion of sonship. Eventually, we will inherit all that God the Father is and all that He has for eternity.</p>
<p>In the church life today we are enjoying the divine sonship to some extent. In the coming age the overcoming believers will enjoy the sonship to a fuller extent. Eventually, in eternity all the believers will enjoy the sonship to the fullest extent. In eternity the believers will be the sons of God, not the people of God. The peoples&mdash;the nations&mdash;will live on the new earth outside the New Jerusalem. However, the believers as sons of God will dwell in the New Jerusalem, participate in all its enjoyment, serve God and the Lamb, and reign for eternity (Rev. 22:3-5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The entire revelation of the Bible is that God wants to dispense Himself into man and to be mingled with man to produce a marvelous entity with Himself as the content and with man as His expression. This marvelous entity is the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people. This consummation is altogether related to the New Jerusalem. After the millennium the old heaven and the old earth will pass away through fire and be renewed into the new heaven and new earth, into which the New Jerusalem will come. In this environment that is new and eternal the believers will enjoy the eternal life to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>Revelation says that only those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life will enter into the New Jerusalem. In the middle of the street of the New Jerusalem is a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. Those who enter into the New Jerusalem will be given to drink of the spring of the water of life. They will also have the right to eat the tree of life for the life supply. The water of life signifies the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, and the tree of life signifies Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God. The flowing of the water of life with the tree of life is the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen people as their life and life supply in fullness for eternity.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a living composition of all the redeemed and perfected saints in both the Old Testament and the New Testament throughout the generations. It is also the bride, the wife of the Lamb&mdash;Christ&rsquo;s eternal counterpart. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is not a physical city but a corporate person, the aggregate of God&rsquo;s redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified people. After all God&rsquo;s redeemed saints have been raptured to the heavens, they will be the New Jerusalem, which will come down out of heaven from God. The holy city, New Jerusalem, will also be God&rsquo;s tabernacle, God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place among men for His rest. The New Jerusalem is designed and built by God to be a full manifestation of His multifarious wisdom.</p>
<p>The believers will be the sons of God in the New Jerusalem enjoying the divine sonship to the fullest. In the church life today we are enjoying the divine sonship to some extent. In the coming age the overcoming believers will enjoy the sonship to a fuller extent. Eventually, in eternity all the believers will enjoy the sonship to the fullest extent. They will dwell in the New Jerusalem, participate in all its enjoyment, serve God and the Lamb, and reign for eternity.</p>

<p>In this lesson we will consider further aspects of the believers&rsquo; future in the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. ENJOYING THE LAMB-GOD, THE REDEEMING GOD,<br />
IN THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<p>In the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, that is, in the New Jerusalem, the believers will enjoy the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, in His Triune dispensing. Revelation 22:1 speaks of &ldquo;the throne of God and of the Lamb,&rdquo; showing that there is one throne for God and the Lamb. This indicates that God and the Lamb are one&mdash;the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, God the Redeemer. In eternity the God who sits on the throne will be our redeeming God, from whose throne proceeds the river of water of life for our supply and satisfaction. This depicts how the Triune God&mdash;God, the Lamb, and the Spirit (symbolized by the water of life)&mdash;dispenses Himself into His redeemed people under His headship, implied in the authority of the throne, for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The One on the Throne Being<br />
the Center of the Holy City</h2>
<p>In eternity future the believers will enjoy the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, who is on the throne as the center of the holy city for the administration of the eternal kingdom of God (vv. 3, 1). Every nation has a center. The center of a nation is its capital, the place where the central government is located. The New Jerusalem also has a center&mdash;the throne of God and of the Lamb. God is the One who had a purpose, who made a plan in eternity past, and who created all things for the fulfillment of His plan. The Lamb is the One who has accomplished redemption to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. Therefore, the throne of God and of the Lamb indicates that this throne is for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s plan through Christ&rsquo;s redemption. Both God&rsquo;s plan and Christ&rsquo;s redemption are being carried out through this throne.</p>
<p>The throne of God and of the Lamb is the source from which the river of water of life flows. The throne for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose flows out the Triune God so that by this flow of life His purpose may be accomplished. Hence, the redeeming God is administrating within the New Jerusalem, and this administrating will be for the carrying out in full of God&rsquo;s dispensing and for His expression in His eternal manifestation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Being the Temple of the Holy City<br />
for the Believers&rsquo; Eternal Dwelling with God<br />
as His Serving Ones</h2>
<p>The believers will enjoy the redeeming God as the temple of the holy city for their eternal dwelling with God as His serving ones (21:22; 22:3). Actually, the holy city is the tabernacle, and the tabernacle is the temple. Here we have three things: the holy city, the tabernacle, and the temple. The term <em>holy city</em> signifies the believers&rsquo; being constituted together as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The word <em>tabernacle</em> denotes God&rsquo;s habitation, and the word <em>temple</em> indicates that the redeeming God will be the place in which the believers dwell and serve Him. Therefore, the holy city denotes the constitution, the tabernacle denotes God&rsquo;s habitation, and the temple denotes our dwelling place in which we serve God. The holy city is the tabernacle, and in the tabernacle the redeeming God will be the temple. This means that the city is the constitution, the building up of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle for God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and within this tabernacle is God Himself as the temple to be our dwelling place.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:22 says that the apostle John saw no temple in the New Jerusalem, for the temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb. Since God and the Lamb are the temple, They are the dwelling place of the believers, who serve the Triune God by dwelling in Him. On the one hand, the New Jerusalem, which is composed of all the redeemed saints as the habitation of God, is the tabernacle; on the other hand, the New Jerusalem, which is constituted of the processed Triune God as the dwelling place of all the redeemed saints, is the temple. Thus, the New Jerusalem is the mutual dwelling of both the redeeming God and His redeemed. The New Jerusalem is both the tabernacle and the temple. The tabernacle is the redeemed, and the temple is the redeeming God. This indicates strongly that the redeeming Triune God is mingled with His redeemed, through the processes that He has gone through and the salvation that His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed tripartite people have experienced, for His expression in His eternal manifestation.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Being the Light of Life in the Lamp<br />
Shining through the Holy City</h2>
<p>In eternity future the believers will enjoy God who is the light of life in the lamp shining through the holy city. Revelation 21:23 says, &ldquo;The city has no need of the sun or of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb.&rdquo; In the millennium the light of the sun and the moon will be intensified (Isa. 30:26). But in the New Jerusalem, in the new heaven and the new earth, there will be no need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, for the Lord God, the divine light, will shine much more brightly there (Rev. 22:5). The Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light. Since such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it will have no need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man.</p>
<p>In Revelation 21:23 God is the light and Christ is the lamp. The light is in the lamp, and the Lamb as the lamp shines with God as the light. This indicates that God and the Lamb are actually one, just as the light and the lamp are one. God is the content, and the Lamb, Christ, is the light-bearer, the expression. The glory of God, with God as the substance, essence, and element, will be the light of the New Jerusalem shining in the Lamb as the lamp. This means that God as the light will shine in Christ as the lamp throughout the city. This also indicates that the throne of God and of the Lamb spoken of in 22:1 refers to the fact that God is in the Lamb sitting on the throne. The light of life in the lamp is a matter of the divine dispensing, for shining is a dispensing. The shining of the divine light is actually the dispensing of the processed Triune God into the believers. For eternity we will enjoy the redeeming God&mdash;God in the Lamb shining as the light of life&mdash;in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Being the Spring of the Water of Life</h2>
<p>In eternity future the believers will enjoy the redeeming God as the spring of the water of life in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity (21:6). In the New Jerusalem we will have both the light of life and the spring of the water of life. The water flows out of this spring to saturate the believers, and this saturation, which involves God&rsquo;s dispensing, is our eternal portion.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being the River of Water of Life,<br />
the Flow of the Dispensing Triune God,<br />
Proceeding out of the Throne in the Middle<br />
of the Street of the Holy City</h2>
<p>In eternity future in the New Jerusalem the believers will enjoy not only the spring of the water of life but also the river of water of life, a river bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (22:1). The spring is the source, and the river is the flow; both the source and the flow are of the water of life. Here we see the flowing Triune God&mdash;the Father as the source, the Son as the course, and the Spirit as the flow. This is a picture of the Triune God dispensing Himself into His believers. He is flowing Himself out of Himself into His redeemed ones to be their life and life supply. The flowing of the Triune God is typified by the water that came out of the smitten rock in Exodus 17:6 (see also Num. 20:11) and is symbolized by the water that flowed out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus (John 19:34). In the New Jerusalem this water of life becomes a river proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem. Thus, the New Jerusalem is filled with the divine life to express God in His glory of life. This dispensing comes out of God&rsquo;s administrating throne.</p>
<p>The river of water of life flows in the middle of the street of pure gold (Rev. 21:21; 22:1) in the New Jerusalem, signifying that the divine life flows in the divine nature as the unique way for the daily life of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. This is the holy way by which God&rsquo;s redeemed people walk. The divine life and the divine nature as the holy way always go together. Where the divine life flows, there is the divine nature as the holy way; and where the holy way of the divine nature is, there the divine life is flowing. Thus, the river of water of life is available along this divine way, and we enjoy it by walking in the divine way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being the Tree of Life<br />
Growing on the Two Sides of the River</h2>
<p>In eternity future the believers will enjoy Christ as the tree of life for their life supply in the New Jerusalem. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month.&rdquo; The tree of life grows on the two sides of the river of water of life and produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month. Hence, the tree of life is a vine that grows in the river of water of life and spreads and proceeds along the flow of the water of life to every part of the holy city for God&rsquo;s redeemed people to receive and enjoy. In this way every part of the holy city receives the life supply. Since the tree of life grows in the river of water of life, the supply of life is in the flow of life. This is a picture of God&rsquo;s dispensing. Christ as the tree of life is the life supply available in the flow of the Spirit as the water of life. Where the Spirit flows, there the life supply of Christ is found. The entire city of the New Jerusalem, which will be constituted of all the redeemed people of God, will be watered by the river of water of life and nourished by the tree of life. This is the dispensing of the Triune God in full for eternity.</p>
<p>In the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we will enjoy the light of life, the spring of the water of life, the river of water of life, and the tree of life. These four things are for the divine dispensing. The light of life shines. The spring of the water of life and the river of water of life are for the flow of the divine life. The tree of life is for nourishing God&rsquo;s redeemed. The shining, the flowing, and the nourishing are three aspects of the divine dispensing. This is the triune dispensing of the Divine Trinity to be our supply. In eternity we will enjoy this supply and thereby have the fullest enjoyment of the divine life.</p><h2 class="head1">V. REIGNING AS KINGS<br />
OVER THE NATIONS FOREVER AND EVER</h2>
<p>For eternity in the New Jerusalem the believers will reign as kings over the nations, the people around the New Jerusalem, forever and ever (v. 5). In the consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers will be members of God&rsquo;s royal family, reigning as kings over the nations.</p>
<p>In eternity future there will be people who are not regenerated believers. These people, the nations, will simply be the natural man created by God and restored to the natural condition of God&rsquo;s creation. They are a different category from the believers. The believers are people belonging to God; they are God&rsquo;s sons born of Him; they are regenerated of God with His life and nature. The nations, however, will simply be a restored people in God&rsquo;s creation. In eternity the tree of life will have two functions, because there will be both the believers and the nations. The first function is related to the fruit of the tree of life, and the second function is related to its leaves. The fruit of the tree of life will be a supply to the sons of God, but the leaves of the tree will be for the healing of the nations (v. 2), keeping them alive for eternity. The leaves of the tree of life symbolize the deeds of Christ. The regenerated believers will eat the fruit of the tree of life, receiving Christ as their inward life and life supply so that they may enjoy the divine life for eternity. The restored nations will be healed by the leaves of the tree of life, taking the deeds of Christ as their outward guide and regulation so that they may live the human life forever (21:4). When the nations look at the way the Lord Jesus lives and acts, His deeds will become a source of healing to them, and this healing will maintain their human life forever.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers will be the royal family, the ruling ones, but the nations will be the common people, the ruled ones. We thank the Lord that in His mercy He first made us vessels of mercy unto honor and then unto glory. In eternity we will be in glory, full of honor, reigning as kings over the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. EXPRESSING GOD WITH HIS GLORY</h2>
<p>In eternity, in the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, all the believers will express God with His glory. The city of the New Jerusalem has the glory of God. Revelation 21:18 says that the wall of the New Jerusalem will be made of jasper, and verse 11 says that the light of the city will be &ldquo;like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, as clear as crystal.&rdquo; The glory of God is the expression of God, God expressed. Jasper is the appearance of God (4:3), and it signifies God&rsquo;s communicable glory in His rich life (John 17:22, 2). The light of the New Jerusalem will be like a jasper stone. The city will bear the appearance of God to express God by her shining. This indicates that the New Jerusalem will be a corporate and eternal expression of God.</p>
<p>In the consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity all believers will express God. We will have the appearance of jasper, the appearance of God, and we will express God in His glory. This expression of the Triune God will be His eternal manifestation according to His eternal economy for the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. ENLIGHTENING THE NATIONS</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem will express God as jasper stone with His glory in order to enlighten the nations. In this way the nations will walk by the light of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:24). God as the light in the lamp will not shine over the nations directly. The divine light will first shine in the city, and then through the city it will shine over the nations. Hence, the nations will walk in the light of the city; that is, they will walk in the light of the believers&rsquo; shining. In the New Testament age we as believers are the light of the world (Matt. 5:14), and the worldly people should walk in our light. In eternity all the redeemed people of God will be a great light shining over the nations, and the nations will walk in this light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. BEING IN RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>In eternity the believers will be altogether in resurrection. Nothing about them will be natural. The nations outside the city, on the contrary, will still be natural and will remain in the natural life. But the believers, the constituents of the holy city, will be absolutely in resurrection.</p>
<p>Revelation 21:17 indicates that the New Jerusalem will be in resurrection. This verse says, &ldquo;He measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.&rdquo; It is in resurrection that man will be like the angels (Matt. 22:30). Man&rsquo;s being like an angel indicates the principle of resurrection. Hence, <em>the measure of a man, that is, of an angel</em> signifies that the city will be not natural but in resurrection. In eternity nothing will be left of our natural life, for we will be fully in resurrection. Therefore, the entire city will be in resurrection. Both Christ the Head and we His members will be in resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IX. BEING THE MINGLING OF DIVINITY WITH HUMANITY</h2>
<p>Finally, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity will be the mingling of divinity with humanity. This mingling is signified by the number twelve (Rev. 21:12-14, 17, 21). Twelve is composed of three multiplied by four. The New Jerusalem is a square with four sides, and on each side there are three gates (v. 13). The number twelve is used fourteen times in relation to the New Jerusalem. The twelve foundations of twelve precious stones bear the names of the twelve apostles (vv. 14, 19-20). The twelve gates of twelve pearls with twelve angels bear the names of the twelve tribes of Israel (vv. 12, 21). The city&rsquo;s measurement is twelve thousand (twelve multiplied by one thousand) stadia in three dimensions (v. 16). The height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits (v. 17), which is twelve cubits multiplied by twelve. The tree of life produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit in each of the twelve months (22:2). The number twelve appears so many times, indicating that the holy city is a mingling of the Triune God in His eternal administration with the redeemed, regenerated, transformed, and glorified tripartite man.</p>
<p>For eternity the New Jerusalem will be an absolute mingling, not simply an addition. It is a multiplication&mdash;the Triune God, who is signified by the number three, multiplied by man, who is signified by the number four. Therefore, the New Jerusalem is a marvelous mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, built-up, and glorified tripartite people for His glorious and utmost expression in His consummated manifestation for eternity in the new creation of resurrection. It is by the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity that the believers can have such a glorious future. We are truly full of praises and thanks for such a divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, that is, in the New Jerusalem, the believers will enjoy the Lamb-God, the redeeming God, in His triune dispensing. The Lamb-God is on the throne as the center of the holy city for the administration of the eternal kingdom of God. The throne of God and of the Lamb indicates that this throne is for the carrying out of God&rsquo;s plan and Christ&rsquo;s redemption. This throne is also the source from which the river of water of life flows for the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s purpose.</p>
<p>The redeeming God, whom the believers will enjoy in eternity future, will also be the temple of the holy city for their eternal dwelling with God as His serving ones. The God whom we enjoy in eternity future will also be the light of life in the lamp shining through the holy city. Because such a divine light will illumine the holy city, the city will have no need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man. The shining of the divine light is actually the dispensing of the processed Triune God. For eternity we will enjoy the redeeming God&mdash;God in the Lamb shining as the light of life&mdash;in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The believers will also enjoy the redeeming God as the spring of the water of life in the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. The water flows out of the spring to saturate the believers, and this saturation is their eternal portion. They will also enjoy the river of water of life, which is bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to supply and saturate the entire New Jerusalem. Thus, the New Jerusalem is filled with the divine life to express God in His glory of life. The river of water of life that flows in the middle of the street of pure gold in the New Jerusalem signifies that the divine life flows in the divine nature as the unique way for the daily life of God&rsquo;s redeemed people, a way by which God&rsquo;s redeemed people walk. The tree of life that grows on the two sides of the river produces twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month to be the life supply to the believers in the New Jerusalem for eternity. The four things we enjoy&mdash;the light, the spring of the water of life, the river of water of life, and the tree of life&mdash;are all for the divine dispensing.</p>
<p>In the New Jerusalem the believers will be in glory, full of honor, reigning as kings over the nations for eternity. The nations will be the people around the New Jerusalem, taking the deeds of Christ as their outward guide and regulation so that they may live the human life forever. In eternity all the believers will express God with His glory. We will have the appearance of jasper, the appearance of God. The holy city, New Jerusalem, expresses God as the jasper stone with His glory to enlighten the nations. In this way the nations will walk by the light of the New Jerusalem. In eternity the believers will be altogether in resurrection. The nations outside the city, on the contrary, will still be natural and will remain in the natural life. But the believers, the constituents of the holy city, will be absolutely in resurrection. Finally, the New Jerusalem as the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity will be the mingling of divinity with humanity, which is a marvelous mingling of the processed Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, built-up, and glorified tripartite people for His glorious and utmost expression in His consummated manifestation for eternity in the new creation of resurrection. It is by the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity that the believers have such a glorious future. We are truly full of praises and thanks for such a divine dispensing.</p>
