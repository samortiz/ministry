<h2 class="head2">Work in Jien-Ou, Fukien Province</h2><p>Thank the Lord for hearing our prayer. On March 2 Brothers Chen Jsai-seng, Chen Ke-san, and Chai Tse-chung came to Jien-Ou, and we had meetings continuously for twenty days. God has been with us in the work, and the condition is quite good. May the Lord gain all the glory and praise! Amen. The meetings concluded on the twenty-eighth. Five brothers and seven sisters were baptized. Brother Chen Ke-san left early for Ku-Tien at the invitation of the brothers. Brothers Tse-chung and Jai-seng are still talking to the newly baptized ones about the truth concerning the church.</p><p>We have also begun the Lord's table for the remembrance of the Lord. Praise the Lord! Although there are less than twenty people, the spiritual atmosphere is intense. Tonight will be our third table meeting. Thank the Lord! Recently the brothers were invited to preach the gospel to a group of drug addicts at the Health Department's drug rehabilitation center. We have a sister who works as the head nurse, who is very burdened for the souls of these people. Through this meeting the Lord saved one man who had been smoking opium for over forty years. After he believed, he was not only delivered from the bondage of the opium but also freed from many illnesses. If the Lord can save this brother, surely He can save others who have the same illness. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!</p><p>Sister Yu-bing, April 7</p><h2 class="head2">Footsteps of a Few Co-workers in Fukien Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Ho in the Lord:</p><p>Two months ago the Lord's workers, Brothers Chai Tse-chung and Chen Jai-seng, went with Brother Chen Ke-san to work in Jien-Ou in north Fukien. They passed by Yien-Ping and came to Foochow. On the twenty-fourth of last month, they passed by Ying-Chien and went to Chang-Loh to visit the saints. The saints insisted that they stay for five days of meetings. Every morning there was prayer, and in the afternoon they preached the gospel. All the meetings were held in the Gospel Hall in Tai-Ping Chiao. In the evenings there were the edification meetings in the house of Dr. Wu You-min. By the grace of God, the meetings were excellent even though the political condition was tense. On the twenty-ninth Brothers Chai and Chen went to visit Miss X (a missionary) in Bai-Ya-Tan. They rested there for two days. On the first morning of this month, they went to Che-Yu to visit Brother Huang Da-ji. In the afternoon they returned to Bai-Ya-Tan. Brother Chen Ke-san also happened to be there on the same day, and they attended the Tuesday meeting together. This meeting used to be conducted by Miss M. E. Barber on the first Tuesday of every month and has continued through all these years. Most of the attendees are workers from Foochow, Chang-Loh, and Lien-Jiang. Although it lasts for only one day, there are four to five meetings. The contents of the meetings concern prayer, mutual sharing, edification, and fellowship. During this critical period we are still able to meet in peace and to encourage one another. The Lord's grace and love are beyond our tongue's description. We can only thank and praise Him. May the Lord preserve His children everywhere to live in peace and godliness until His return, when we will share in His glory, amen. Brother Chai and the two Chens left for Foochow on the third and returned to Pu-Han on the fourth. Brother Ong Je-dun was working in the Yung-Tai and Lien-Jiang areas. However, due to his weak health, he is now resting in Lien-Jiang and Ma-Wei. He has recuperated slightly. Yesterday, he also left Bai-Ya-Tan. I heard that he will be traveling to north Fukien to visit the saints. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p><p>Brother Fang Jia-ze, May 6</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Han Fu-shen, Ch'ang-Teh</h2><p>I returned yesterday. I went to Dong-Ping to visit Brother Zhang. It took me nine days to get there and eight days to return. I stayed in Dong-Ping for only two days. I intend to go to Chi-Li and then to Da-Yung. I have asked Brother Paul Tsao to stay temporarily in Yuan-Ling. The political situation is very tense. Hopefully, nothing will happen in the next two months. When I return from Da-Yung, I hope to be able to travel safely to Yuan-Ling. Last month four sisters and two brothers were baptized in Ch'ang-Teh and Chou-Jia-Dien. After we left, there were only three brothers left in Ch'ang-Teh. Brother Fung is now working in the post office. He is responsible for everything here. The meeting in the countryside is headed up by Brother Mei Han-ke, a newly raised up brother.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Han Fu-shen, April 5</p>
