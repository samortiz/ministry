 <h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT INCLUDING THE SON&rsquo;S<br />
ACCOMPLISHMENTS, ATTAINMENTS,<br />
AND OBTAINMENTS</h2>
<p>When this Spirit comes to us as the Son, He comes with all that the Son has accomplished, attained, and obtained. The first item of the Son&rsquo;s accomplishments is His incarnation. Then the Son accomplished human living. Many Christians neglect this item, but we all must realize that for God to live on this earth for thirty-three and a half years was a great thing. The very Creator of the universe, which includes the heavens, the earth, and billions of items, lived on this earth as a man among men, even in a poor family. This is marvelous that God the Creator would live as a man on this earth for thirty-three and a half years. He experienced the human life, the human sufferings, all the human sorrows, all the human problems and troubles, and all the trials and temptations. He experienced all these things, and He passed through all these things. Such a human living was accomplished by Jesus. He also accomplished an all-inclusive death, an excellent and marvelous resurrection, and an exalting ascension. Thus, the accomplishments of Christ include His incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and ascension. These are all included in and attached to the Person of Christ.</p>
<p>The attainments of Christ include His ascension &ldquo;far above all the heavens&rdquo; (Eph. 4:10). The visible clouds may be considered the first heaven, and the sky, the second heaven. The third heaven must refer to the heaven of the heavens (2 Cor. 12:2), the highest heaven (Deut. 10:14; Psa. 148:4), where the Lord Jesus and God are today (Eph. 4:10; Heb. 4:14; 1:3). His ascension to the third heavens means that He attained to the highest place in the universe. He ascended on high, and nothing is higher than Him (Eph. 1:21). This is spacewise; according to space, He is the highest. Christ also attained to the height of all the virtues. He attained to the height of all morality. His attainments include Him being a mingling of the divine attributes with the human virtues, issuing in a life in the highest standard of morality. Ephesians 1:21 also tells us that His attainments include His being &ldquo;far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named.&rdquo; His attainments also include His being crowned with glory and honor in ascension (Heb. 2:9). Glory is the splendor related to Jesus&rsquo; Person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus&rsquo; worth, value (1 Pet. 2:7, &ldquo;precious&rdquo; in Gk. is the same word as &ldquo;honor&rdquo; here), and dignity which is related to His position (2 Pet. 1:17; cf. 1 Pet. 2:17; Rom. 13:7).</p>
<p>In addition to His attainments, Christ obtained the kingship, the lordship, and the headship, including all authority. This embodiment of the Triune God is not only a wonderful Person, but a wonderful Person with the highest accomplishments, attainments, and obtainments. We must remember that when the Spirit comes into us as the Son, this includes all the Son&rsquo;s accomplishments, attainments, and obtainments.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT COMING INTO US WITH THE FATHER</h2>
<p>The Spirit does not only come into us as the Son, but also with the Father, including the Father&rsquo;s plan, the Father&rsquo;s choosing (Eph. 1:4), the Father&rsquo;s predestination (Eph. 1:5), and the Father&rsquo;s glory (John 17:22). The divine title of the Father, especially in the New Testament, comprises His plan, His selection, His predestination, and His glory. The Spirit comes into us as the Son with the Father, which includes all that the Son has accomplished, attained, and obtained and all of the Father&rsquo;s plan, selection, predestination, and glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING ALL-INCLUSIVE</h2>
<p>This is why we say that the Spirit we have received is the all-inclusive Spirit. According to the type in Exodus 30 this Spirit is a compound Spirit (vv. 22-25). The compound ointment in Exodus 30 was comprised of various spices compounded together with olive oil. This compound ointment is a picture, a type, of the all-inclusive compounded Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. We must praise the Lord that this Spirit is in the church, in you and in me!</p>
