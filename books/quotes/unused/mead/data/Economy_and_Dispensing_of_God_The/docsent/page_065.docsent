   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Letting No Corrupt Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Proceed out of Our Mouth, but Only</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That Which Is Good for Needful Building Up,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That It May Give Grace, in the Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>of the Divine Life, to the Hearers</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fourth point is that we should let no corrupt word proceed out of our mouth v. 29 . Today, because of the turmoil, many times we hear corrupt words, that is, words that bring death to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we hear these words, we should not consider whether they are right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rather, we should check whether they enliven us or kill us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As long as a word kills us, it is a corrupt word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not allow this kind of word to proceed out of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Instead, we should speak only words that are good for needful building up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do this, we will give grace, another form of what God is, in the dispensing of the divine life, to the hearers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not Grieving the Holy Spirit,</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>in Whom We Were Sealed,</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>for the Dispensing of the Divine Trinity,</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>unto or, for the Day of the</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Redemption of our Body</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fifth point is that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit v. 30 . If the Holy Spirit is grieved, we will not be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we are not happy, that is a sign that the Holy Spirit within us is not happy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This Holy Spirit is sealing us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This sealing is the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, and it is unto the day of the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Greek the word unto can also mean for.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are not sealed merely unto the day of redemption, but also for the day of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that through the soaking and saturating of the sealing, we will be qualified to be redeemed on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The sealing is for that day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we are not sealed and permeated by the sealing ink of the Holy Spirit today, we cannot expect to be redeemed on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our daily sealing today is to qualify us for the redemption on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Abstaining, in the Divine Dispensing,</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>from All Bitterness, Anger, Wrath, Clamor,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>and Evil Speaking, with All Malice</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sixth point is that we must abstain from all bitterness, anger, wrath, clamor, and evil speaking, with all malice v. 31 . The word all modifies all the succeeding items.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that we should abstain not only from all bitterness, but also from all anger, all wrath, all clamor, all evil speaking, and all malice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, we need to keep ourselves pure from all these dirty things.</S>
