   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE SEED, THE ROOT, THE BRANCH,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE FRUIT Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15; 22:18; 2 Sam 7:12-14a; Isa 4:2; 11:1-2, 10; 53:2; Jer 23:5-6; Zech 6:12-13; Matt 1:17, 20-21, 23; 16:13-17; 18:20; 28:19-20 A WONDERFUL PERSON WITH WONDERFUL NAMES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible is a wonderful book with a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should never consider this divine book as being wonderful in anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some think that the Bible is wonderful in doctrines and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do admit there are good teachings in this wonderful book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we must all realize that it is wonderful because it portrays to us a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This wonderful person is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am afraid that we know far too little about this wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no need for me to mention His depth and His unsearchable riches.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Simply His name is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of us do not know anything about His name.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Have you ever heard that Jesus is called the Branch?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord Zech 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is one of the wonderful names of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Along with the branch, Jesus is called another name in Jeremiah: Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS Jer 23:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE SEED OF WOMAN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus also has another name: the Seed of a Woman.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is seen in Genesis 3:15.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why is Jesus called the Seed of Woman?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To see this we must realize that in order to fulfill His purpose God created man as the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not a small thing that we have been created in God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Adam was made in the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But God said that it was not good for man to be alone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>So He took a part of the man and built this part into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many times those of us who are husbands wish that we did not have a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet, on the other hand, we simply cannot go on without a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s economy destines us in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, God prepared a wife for man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But not long after God made a help meet for man, Satan entered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He did not make his first approach to mankind through the man, but through the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The husband may be likened to the front door, and the wife to the back door.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He came in from the woman s direction, not from the man s. This may seem terrible, but it is really wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Forty years ago I heard a message by Brother Watchman Nee in which he said that in the entire universe God has an enemy, who may be likened to a mouse running loose in our house.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can we get rid of him?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The best way is to set a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>With the trap, there is always a little door.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The door to the trap is the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The trap-maker made the door.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then one day Satan came into mankind through this door.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He thought that he had captured man, but God had caught the enemy in a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why in Genesis 3 God told the enemy that the seed of the woman would bruise his head.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So eventually we see that the woman is not so bad.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually she is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Though Satan came in through the woman, the Seed who would bruise the serpent s head also came in through the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus was not the seed of a man; He was the seed of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the sisters should be proud of this.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since the day Jesus came in through woman, there is the wonderful story of woman in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Not long ago I fellowshipped with the sisters in Los Angeles about the six Marys recorded in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Of course, the first Mary was the woman through whom Jesus was born.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With Mary there is the seed of woman, and Jesus name is her seed.</S>
