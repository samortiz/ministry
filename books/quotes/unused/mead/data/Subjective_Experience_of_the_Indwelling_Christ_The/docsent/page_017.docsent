   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE HOW TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST'S INDWELLING Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21; 2:3-8; 3:6b-9; 4:8-9, 13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have covered the indwelling Christ and Christ's indwelling in the previous chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us see how we can experience Christ's indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The entire Bible tells us a wonderful and mysterious thing, that is, that the Triune God desires to work Himself into His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He wants to abide in them to be their life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have said that the mystery of the universe is God; God is the answer to all the mysteries of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>How wonderful it is that this God, who is the mystery of the universe, has entered into us to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Genesis chapter one says that God created the heavens, the earth, and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Chapter two says that God formed man of the dust of the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God created the heavens, the sun, the rain, and the air for the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The earth brought forth herbs and grains for man's existence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God created man after He had finished His creation of the heavens, the earth, and all things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>MAN BEARING GOD'S IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Genesis 1 we are told that God created all things according to their kind: fish according to the fish-kind and birds according to the bird-kind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every living thing was according to its kind and belongs to its kind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But God created man in His image and according to His likeness vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, man is according to God's kind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since man was created in God's image, man's image is God's image; man is a photograph of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For example, if you want your relatives to see me, but you are unable to bring me to them, then you can take a picture of me and bring it with you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although this picture is not the real me, it can somewhat show them my outward appearance because it is my picture.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible tells us that man was created in God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man is just like a photograph taken according to the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the one hand, the Bible says that God created man in His image, but on the other hand, it says that God is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is invisible, yet He has an image; this is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The image mentioned in the Bible does not refer to the outward appearance, which is visible, but rather to the inward nature, which is invisible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, we often say that a son looks like his father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If the father is round-faced, the son is also round-faced; if the father has big eyes and large ears, then the son also has big eyes and large ears.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is an outward resemblance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Another kind of resemblance is a resemblance in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If the father is meek and kind, so also is the son; if the father is soft-spoken, so also is the son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God created man in His image; this image refers not to the outward appearance but to the inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>GOD'S IMAGE BEING LOVE, LIGHT, HOLINESS, AND RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Colossians 2:9 says, "For in Him Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the revelation in the Bible, the essential nature of the Godhead is first, love; second, it is light; third, it is holiness; and fourth, it is righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is kind and God is full of brightness, because God is love and God is light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Love and light do not have an image; they are divine attributes and characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Love, light, holiness, and righteousness are the essential nature of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God is God because He is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Love and holiness are the nature of God's essence; light and righteousness are the nature of God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Himself, God is love and holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When He is expressed, He is light and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, God is a thoughtful God, and He is also rich in emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He loves, and He also shows anger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He has feelings of joy, anger, sorrow, and delight.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible also tells us that God is a God of purpose and action; therefore, He is also a God with a will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE CREATED MAN HAVING GOD'S IMAGE</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now let us look at man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Man also has the same three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man is thoughtful, man has emotions, and man has a will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that man has God's image.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God is wise and thoughtful, God is rich in emotions, and God has a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God created man, He created man according to such an image.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God has thoughts, so He created us with a mind; God has emotions, so He created man also with emotions; God has a will, so He created man also with a will.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moreover, the conventional ethics that we profess are included in these four items of what God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If your daily walk is full of love, light, holiness, and righteousness, then you are a perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The conventional ethics defined by men are implied in these four items.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We were created according to such an image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God wants us to be loving and kind; He wants us to be honest and upright; He wants us to be holy and uncontaminated; He wants us to be righteous, not practicing unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Throughout the ages, in all lands, among all peoples, whether barbaric or civilized, anyone who steals will have a sense of shame and darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A person does not have to be educated to develop this sense because it is inherent in his created nature.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Children have a desire to honor their parents and to love and care for others because these qualities are inherent in the created human nature.</S>
