   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The man was put into custody "because it had not been made plain what should be done to him" v. 34 . God spoke to Moses concerning this, saying, "The man shall surely be put to death; all the assembly shall stone him with stones outside the camp" v. 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may think that gathering wood on the Sabbath was not a serious offense and that the punishment meted out was too severe.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"All the assembly brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones and he died, as Jehovah commanded Moses" v. 36 . This time the people were not disobedient.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To keep the Sabbath is to believe in God and obey God to participate in what He has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To break the Sabbath is to break the principle that we should not strive for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Breaking this principle leads to death.</S>
