<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1><h1 class="title">SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(1)</h1><h1 class="title">PRINCIPLES AND QUALIFICATIONS<br />FOR JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:September 29, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">THE IMPORTANCE OF SPIRITUAL JUDGMENT</h2><p>The judgment that we are speaking of today is not the kind of judgment carried out in the law courts. It is spiritual judgment. The first thing we have to realize is that unless we know how to judge and discern, we will face difficulties and will be easily deceived in our service to the Lord. We need to note a few things related to the matter of judgment.</p><h2 class="head1">FIVE PRINCIPLES OF JUDGMENT</h2><p>First, there is a difference between experiences related to the truth and experiences related to the discipline of the Holy Spirit. In speaking with the brothers and sisters, we have to pay attention to the lessons they have learned, whether they are in the line of truth or in the line of discipline from the Holy Spirit. Some are strong in one aspect, while others are strong in the other aspect. Some have learned their lessons mainly through the truth, while others have learned their lessons mainly through the discipline of the Holy Spirit. Learning one's lesson through the truth means that one hears the words and teachings of the Scriptures and practices what he hears accordingly. Some are touched through reading the Scriptures alone. Others are touched through listening to messages. At any rate they are motivated by the words to obey the Lord. The discipline of the Holy Spirit, however, involves one's realization of the Lord's molding hand. Such a person may be disobedient, murmuring, insubordinate, and opinionated. But when the Lord subdues him, he becomes obedient. These lessons are acquired through experiences related to the environment. One kind of obedience results from teaching. The other kind of obedience results from dealings. We have to distinguish the experiences of the brothers and sisters. It is best to have experiences of both kinds; this is the balanced way and the straight course. A worker of the Lord must be experienced in both aspects. When others are too strong or too weak in one of these areas, he immediately will know what to do. Some are ignorant about the discipline of the Holy Spirit; they are altogether hard and unprocessed. Others have never been trained in the truth; they are ignorant of many church truths and many biblical commands.</p><p>Second, there is a difference between outward things and inward things. Some people care only for outward things and are short of inward things. They are acquainted only with truth; they are obedient only in outward things, such as baptism, leaving the denominations, head covering, etc. They have not learned any inward lessons. Others have experienced much discipline from the Holy Spirit. They have passed through many situations and difficulties, yet these are only outward things to them. These experiences remain outside of the persons and have never entered into their very being. We can experience the discipline of the Holy Spirit in an outward way or in an inward way. For example, a sick person outwardly can act as if he has yielded himself to God's discipline. But inwardly his sickness has not resulted in any joy or praise in him. Outwardly, he may say, "I will accept my sickness!" But this is only acquiescence and endurance; there is no inward praise and thanksgiving. Such discipline remains an outward matter. If a man accepts the sickness, endures the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and goes one step further to praise the Lord in his heart, the discipline he experiences will become an inward matter.</p><p>If a man cannot utter any praise or thanksgiving, being obedient only because he sees God's hand heavy upon him, his discipline remains an outward matter. But if he can praise God for the discipline he receives and be filled with joy, God's discipline will achieve its intended goal. When the discipline becomes an inward work, he will no longer want the sickness to go away quickly; he will no longer crave ease and comfort. Instead he will praise and thank God for what He has done, and he will acknowledge that all His works are good. A man may realize that denominations are wrong and leave them, yet denominationalism may not have left him. His love for the brothers has not increased, and he knows nothing about fellowship. When he sees a brother, he may be able to turn his face towards him, embrace, and even kiss him. He may have an outward expression of love yet not have an inward feeling of love. This kind of love is not genuine; it is outward, not inward. The virtues that the Bible speaks of are attributes of what a man is, not what he does. In judging a brother, we have to find out whether his living is in the outward realm or the inward realm. We have to lead the brothers to turn to the inward realm. Sometimes we hear people say, "Brother So-and-so is wonderful." But how wonderful is this brother? Is he wonderful in an inward sense or in an outward sense? The difference here is very great. We have to learn to know whether a person is living in the outward realm or the inward realm.</p>
