   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DISCERN THE PRESENT PROBLEMS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>RAISED BY THE DISSENTING ONES</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of the rebellion in these past four and a half years, many negative things were spoken by the dissenting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A number of these things were distributed in writing, and some have even become slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message and the next, my intention is to fellowship with you concerning twenty "problems" raised by the dissenting ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. The Problem of Control</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The first problem is the problem of control; this problem comprises four items.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The main thing for which the dissenters condemned me is that I and the Living Stream Ministry office control the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The Centralization of Control"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>by the Training Center</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dissenting ones used the term "the centralization of control."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When their conspiracy began in September 1987, I was in Taiwan conducting a training for full-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In December of that year I came back to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Shortly thereafter, four of the dissenting ones came to speak with me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first one to speak used this term "the centralization of control."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Prior to that time I had never heard such a term.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>While I was waiting to discover the meaning of this term, this brother expressed that my training center in Taipei was considered by them to be a center to control all the churches on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He said that this control was to such an extent that all the churches on the earth had to report their meeting times to my training center in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I had never heard of such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He said that this was my way to control all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He then said that I trained the young people in my training center in Taipei, and eventually they were all instructed and charged to go back to their churches to control the churches for me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the fourth brother continued, saying strongly that the training in Taipei should be dismantled into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Control by the Trainings, Conferences, Messages, Tapes, Etc.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The dissenting brothers also accused me of controlling the churches by my trainings, conferences, messages, tapes, etc. On March 19, 1989, in a word spoken to the church in Anaheim upon his resignation from the eldership, one of the dissenters said, "There has been a pervasive control exercised over the church...The control has not been exercised so much directly, but very much indirectly, through videos, conferences, trainings, and elders' meetings." This word implies that whatever I do in my ministry teaching, training, publishing, and distributing audio and video tapes is all for the purpose of controlling the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In a very positive sense, I would say that my ministry does "control" people.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you are going to take drugs, my trainings will "control" you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you are going to lose your temper with your wife, my books will "control" you.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is true that my trainings, conferences, publications, and tapes exercise a considerable "control" over thousands of people around the globe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without such "control," many people might have done certain things that would have damaged themselves and their families.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this sense, it is true that my ministry "controls" people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Any kind of edification exercises some amount of "control."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the schools, classes, teachers, and professors control their students.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although the "control" exercised by my ministry over the saints and the churches is very positive, the dissenting ones speak of control in a very negative way to undermine my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why I say that when you hear these things, you should not merely react to the outward appearance, to the "shell."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You must bring what you hear to the Lord; then the Lord will lead you to see what the intrinsic thing is within the shell.</S>
