   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETY THE REBELLION OF THE ANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God created the angels with a free will, and God also created man with a free will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If the angels and man had been created without a free will, the Son would not be able to gain any glory, because anything which is dead has no meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If the angels and man, who were endowed with a free will, had allowed the Son to be the Head, the Son would have gained the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet the angels rebelled, man fell, and God's eternal plan was frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God's original intention was to express the glory of Christ through all things and particularly through man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because of the angels' rebellion and man's fall, God's plan was frustrated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE LORD'S RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>WITH THE ANGELS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>AND WITH MAN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to God's ordination, the Lord took on the form of an angel before His incarnation, and He took on the form of a man after incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Old Testament He was the Messenger of God Gen 22:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the New Testament He was made in the likeness of men Phil 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord took on the form of an angel temporarily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He took on the form of an angel for the purpose of revealing Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the Lord has also taken on the form of a man eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the New Testament the Lord not only took on the form of a man but also became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the Lord's relationship with man is much more intimate than His relationship with the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 2:16 says that God did not give help to the angels but to man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In God's plan the Son is joined with man, not with angels.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Perhaps the angels are quite aware of this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE ORIGIN OF SATAN Ezekiel 28:11-19</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Revelation 12:4 tells us that when Satan rebelled against God, one third of the angels went with him and joined his rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word Satan in Greek means "the opposer."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How did Satan become Satan?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How did he rebel against God?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the history of his rebellion?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can find the facts about Satan in Ezekiel 28:11-19 and in Isaiah 14:12-20.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These passages show us how he was created, his original position before God, his beauty, his latter rebellion, and his ultimate fate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Ezekiel 25 uses seventeen verses to describe the destruction of four kingdoms Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Between verses 26:1 and 28:19, there are seventy-six verses that describe one kingdom Tyre.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is because the king of Tyre in 28:12 is a type of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, the Bible places special emphasis on this kingdom and its king.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the adjectives used in verse 28:12 are superlative in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>"Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was "full of wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This wisdom was probably used originally to understand God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, Satan had the function of a prophet before his fall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Verse 13 says, "Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Eden referred to here is different from the Eden spoken of in Genesis 2:8.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This Eden denotes God's dwelling place in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The precious stones denote God's light, and gold signifies God's glory; Satan had both.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In comparing the precious stones that covered him and the stones that covered Aaron, we see that God had probably appointed him to be a priest cf.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Exo 25:7; 28:9-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ezekiel 28:13 continues, "The workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Pipes require breath to produce sound.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hence, they signify life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Tabrets move the heart and express love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The tabrets and pipes signify God's delight.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Musical instruments are always linked to the kings 1 Sam 16:23; Isa 14:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This shows that he was a king.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These three things reveal that Satan functioned as a prophet, priest, and king at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created" means that he belonged to the previous world, distinguishing him from the prince of Tyre in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 14 says, "Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The word "anointed" means that he was separated for God's commission.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"Covereth" refers to the covering of the ark, the place where God's righteousness signified by the blood and God's glory signified by God's appearance are found.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The cherub's duty is to lead men to worship the Lord Rev 4:9-10; 5:11-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He was the one commissioned by God to lead the created hosts to worship God's righteousness and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This again shows his priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Verse 14 continues, "I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God."</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the Bible mountains signify an administrative center.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The great mountain in Daniel 2:35 typifies God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The mountains in Revelation refer to God's administration centers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this verse we are told that Satan was in the seat of God's administration and ruled over all things of that world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>"Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The stones of fire refer to God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This shows that he had intimate fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>According to Ezekiel 1:26, the cherubim are positioned under God's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is confirmed by the picture in Exodus 24:10 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This means that he was very close to God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Ezekiel 28:15 says, "Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything that God creates is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 15 continues, "Till iniquity was found in thee."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The word "till" indicates a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>God did not create a Satan; He created a cherub.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After God's created cherub fell, he became Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The iniquity he committed brought sin into the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Verse 16 says, "By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Mr. Pember said that the word "merchandise" can be translated as "slander." The word devil in the original language means "the accuser" Rev 12:10 . Satan's way of merchandising is to bribe men's hearts with little gifts and favors, as Absalom did.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>"Therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The word "profane" can also be translated "overstepping."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It means going beyond one's rightful place.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As a result God cast him out and stripped him of his rule.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The phrase "O covering cherub" reminded him of his name.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>"And I will destroy thee, O covering Cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This means that the fellowship was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>But this does not mean that Satan could no longer go to God; it merely means that spiritual fellowship was terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Being cast out from the holy mountain denotes being stripped of his administrative post and the fact that he could no longer rule the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Being destroyed from the midst of the stones of fire refers to being stripped of the spiritual fellowship and the fact that he could no longer come near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Verse 17 says, "Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He became proud because of his beauty, and he overstepped his boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He also corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As a result he was cast to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Originally his sphere was the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Now it is limited to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Verse 17 continues, "I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee."</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>These kings were the angels who ruled the world together with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>But only one-third followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Those angels who did not follow him still rule the universe, and they are the kings referred to in this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Psalm 82 shows us that there are many rulers in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Ezekiel 28:18 says, "Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This is the punishment of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The first world was destroyed by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Verse 19 says, "All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more."</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>After this verse the description switches back to the prince of Tyre spoken of in verse 2.</S>
