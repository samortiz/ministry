   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. His Prayer Being against Evil Deeds</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 141:5b David said, "Still my prayer is against their evil deeds."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that David's enemies were doing evil things but that David's prayer was against these evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Here David seemed to be saying, "In spite of the evil things that come to me, I am still praying.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not do anything except pray against these evil deeds."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our situation, however, is often quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When bad things happen to us, we may forget to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For instance, when a brother and his wife are exchanging words, he may forget to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How much better it would be if the brother, instead of arguing with his wife, would pray against that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to learn of David to pray against evil deeds.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>E. Jehovah Knowing His Path</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When His Spirit Fainted within Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 142:3a David had a very particular utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said, "When my spirit fainted within me,/You knew my path."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When David was troubled and his spirit fainted, he did not know what to do or what path to take.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At such a time he realized that Jehovah knew his path.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>F. Saying That Jehovah Is His Refuge</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In his prayer in 142:5 David said that Jehovah was his refuge, his portion in the land of the living.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here David spoke a very good word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>G. Saying That No One Alive</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Is Righteous in God's Sight</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"No one alive is righteous in Your sight" 143:2b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When David prayed in this way, he was including himself among those who were not righteous in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>H. Saying That He Spread Out His Hands</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>to Jehovah and That His Soul Thirsts for Him</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>like a Parched Land</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"I spread out my hands to You;/My soul thirsts for You like a parched land" 143:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead of arguing with others, we should spread out our hands to God and have a soul that thirsts for Him.</S>
