<h2 class="head2">4. The Beginning and Condition<br />of the Meeting in Sung Hsiu Yang</h2><p>This locality is about ten miles from Nan Hsi. A few of them used to come to Nan Hsi for the meetings. With the exception of a few brothers who are clearly saved, it is difficult to tell whether or not the others are brothers. This locality did not need to establish a separate meeting. Before they saw the will of God clearly, and before God raised up some responsible ones, they should definitely not have established a separate meeting. However, there were some who did not want to walk such a long way; they wanted a separate meeting. Others mistakenly heard the brothers say, "Since God is everywhere, people can worship Him anywhere. We do not need to meet together and be bound by geography. The Lord also told the Samaritan woman that she did not have to worship on the mountain or in Jerusalem." These ones wanted to separate also. Some people saw that other localities had separated, so they wanted to do it. Although the brothers exhorted them to do it slowly, they could not wait patiently. So they started a separate meeting in 1929. When they first separated, there were more than ten brothers and sisters. Later, they gradually cooled off. Although the brothers from other localities go there on the Lord's Day to help them, it has been very hard to keep it going. Fortunately, some of the brothers also went to the conference in Lien T'ou and passed through some dealing. The condition of the meeting now is very weak! Sometimes only a few people come to the meetings. I ask all the brothers and sisters who care for the church to pray earnestly for this matter.</p><h2 class="head2">5. The Origin and Condition<br />of the Meeting in Hsiu Hsi</h2><p>I already told you in the preface the general story of how the meeting here began, so I do not need to repeat myself. However, after they left the denomination, no one has continued to do a building work. Therefore, they became colder and drier, darker and weaker, day by day to the extent that it has become a kind of sickness. They were not able to rise up! Although Mr. Ts'ai Chi Ch'ing often works among them to help and encourage them, he is unable to do anything either! Nevertheless, thank the Lord and praise God! The Lord remembers and cares for His poor little lambs! He does not cast away the church He purchased with His blood. In April of this year, He led His faithful servant, Brother Wang Yu T'ing to the churches in Ya Yang. The brothers in Ya Yang also invited the brothers in all the localities to the meetings there. They also sent brothers to Hsiu Hsi especially to invite the brothers! The conference was not long. It only lasted five days, but the Holy Spirit Himself worked in them through His useful vessel to meet their needs in all aspects and to heal all kinds of wounds in them. He watered all their dryness and exposed all their weaknesses. The brothers from Hsiu Hsi came to the conference sad, but they went home rejoicing. Since that time, the Lord has continued to work among them. The dark and weak atmosphere has receded gradually. Their internal condition has been getting brighter and brighter. Even though they have not been fully revived inwardly, their spiritual condition has begun to spring to life. The meeting place is close to the neighbors, and noise from the outside often disturbs the people in the meeting so that the brothers cannot peacefully worship God and remember the Lord. The brothers prayed for this matter in one accord and asked the Lord to arrange a place for them. Thank the Lord, He heard their prayer and has already arranged the land. If there are no special frustrations, the brothers hope to build a meeting place at the end of this year. There are fifteen brothers and sisters in the table meetings. There are fourteen who come to hear messages but have not taken the table yet. Every Lord's Day, Brothers Ts'ai Chia T'ien, Ts'ai Chia Ta, and Ts'ai Er Chia are responsible for preaching the messages and caring for the affairs of the meeting. Old Mr. Ts'ai Chi Ch'ing does not go out of his home often, but he sometimes helps in giving messages. Brothers and sisters, please do not forget to pray for them.</p><h2 class="head2">6. The Beginning and Condition<br />of the Meeting in the Village of Wu</h2><p>Originally, no one in this locality believed. In 1930 the Lord led Mr. Ts'ai Chi Ch'ing of Hsiu Hsi to preach the gospel there. The Lord blessed the work and several brothers believed. One among them is very precious. His name is Brother Pao Ting Ming. He was originally a famous fortune-teller and master of the Taoist principles of Ying and Yang. After he believed in the Lord, he not only repented, but he also cast off his special privileges and was very zealous for the Lord. He offered his home for the meetings and opened it to the brothers for fellowship. He is very good in the matter of hospitality. The church in Hsiu Hsi has borne a cluster of wonderful fruit since leaving the denomination, despite the fact that they were weak. We really thank the Lord and praise God. There are nine brothers and sisters in the table meetings. There are more than ten people who come to hear the messages but who do not take the table yet. Altogether there are more than twenty people in the meetings. The atmosphere in the meetings is very good. If a brother from another locality comes on the Lord's Day, they let him share the message. If no one comes, Brother Ting Ming bears the responsibility. Now the Lord has given them more grace. Their numbers are gradually increasing, but they are young in life and need edification. Brothers and sisters, please pray for this matter.</p>
