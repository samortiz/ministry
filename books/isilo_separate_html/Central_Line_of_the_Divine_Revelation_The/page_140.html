In the New Testament the divine economy and the divine dispensing are revealed in the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation. First, this accomplishment was in Christ's incarnation, and second, it was in Christ's resurrection. We passed over Christ's death because nothing was dispensed in the death of Christ. After Christ's resurrection, the accomplishment of God's full redemption and salvation continued in the breathing of the essential Spirit into the believers and then in the outpouring of the economical Spirit upon the believers.</P><P>Many Christians celebrate the outpouring of the economical Spirit that occurred on the day of Pentecost. However, they do not consider the breathing of the essential Spirit into the disciples in John 20 as important as the outpouring of the economical Spirit. The resurrection of Christ, the breathing of the essential Spirit, and the outpouring of the economical Spirit may be compared to the birth of a child. After a child is delivered, he first begins to breathe, and then he is bathed. The birth of the believers took place at the time of Christ's resurrection (1 Pet. 1:3). After this birth, the disciples began to breathe the Holy Spirit in John 20:22. Then, the Lord Jesus as the Head of the Body "bathed" the Body through the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE BIOGRAPHY OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</H2><P>The Gospel of John may be considered the biography of the Divine Trinity. The Triune God had and still has a biography. The four Gospels are considered by many Christians to be four biographies of the one Savior, the Lord Jesus. The sequence of the arrangement of these four Gospels is very meaningful. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, the synoptic Gospels, mainly concern Christ in His humanity. Christ in His humanity is revealed first as the King-Savior in Matthew, then as the Slave-Savior in Mark, and then as the Man-Savior in Luke. However, what is revealed in the fourth Gospel, the Gospel of John, is Christ's divinity. The Gospel of John, as a biography of our Triune God in His humanity, reveals Christ as the God-man, a person with the divine nature and the human nature. Whereas Matthew and Luke contain a genealogy of the Lord Jesus (Matt. 1:1-17; Luke 3:23-38), John has no genealogy. Rather, John 1:1 says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." The Word had no beginning in time; therefore, He has no genealogy.</P><P>For four thousand years of human history, from the creation of Adam, God was only in His divinity. During that time no one knew the real meaning of the universe and of the human life. God contacted man, and the Spirit of Jehovah even came upon man (Num. 11:25; Judg. 3:10; 6:34; 1 Sam. 16:13), but God was God and man was man. Then one day, almost two thousand years ago, the Word came out of eternity and entered into time. As the threefold seed&#151;the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David&#151;He came into mankind. The infinite and eternal Word became flesh (John 1:14). He was conceived in a human womb and was born of a virgin to be a wonderful man with blood and flesh. The Lord's incarnation, as His beginning in His humanity, was a landmark of His biography in His humanity. In His incarnation, the Divine Trinity was imparted into man's being. That was the divine dispensing.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_139.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_141.html">Next</a> </body></html>
