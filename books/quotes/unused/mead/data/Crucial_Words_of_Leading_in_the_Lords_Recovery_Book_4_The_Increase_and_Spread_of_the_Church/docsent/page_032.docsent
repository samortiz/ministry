   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Avoiding Independent Actions</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Absolutely Keeping</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>the Principle of Coordination in the Body</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today the Lord s grace is with His recovery, and the Lord is continually bestowing grace on His churches.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now the Lord is leading us in a further step to initiate small groups in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The needs of the church in Taipei, with thousands of saints, are simply beyond the capacity of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The burden upon them is very heavy; thus, there is an urgent need to have small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If group after group is up to the standard, it will be similar to a strong nation with good families and good citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When one group after another is raised up in the church, every believer will be strong, and the church will be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the increase, the Spirit will move and guide us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He may arrange an environment to bring us to other cities or may even impart a burden to spread to other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In our functioning in a small group gathering, we must avoid acting independently but do everything in the Body, absolutely keeping the principle of coordination in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FUNCTIONING TO SUPPLY OTHERS Letting the Spirit of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Freely Operate to Release the Lord s Riches and Fulfill His Heart s Desire</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we function to supply others, we need to let the Spirit of the Lord freely operate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord in us is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom 2 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once the Lord s Spirit has the freedom to move, the Lord will release His riches and fulfill His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we carry out our function, continually learning to exercise our spirit and giving the Lord the freedom in our spirit, He will release His riches through us and fulfill His heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being Burdened to Shepherd, Teach, and Perfect the Young or Weak Saints</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all must receive a burden to shepherd, teach, and perfect the young or weak brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE MEMBERS OF A SMALL GROUP NEEDING</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TO BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY OF</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>TEACHING AND SHEPHERDING</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The brothers and sisters with more experience need to teach and shepherd those who are young or weak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the small group, no one should be without such care.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Needing to Lead Every Person in the Group Being Responsible to Seek and</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recover the Dormant Saints</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to lead every person in the group to be responsible to seek and recover saints who have not been meeting for a long time and those with whom we have lost contact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this we should actively review our information cards.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to our current statistics, at least one hundred thousand people were baptized in Taiwan over the last thirty years, with as many as fifty or sixty thousand in the church in Taipei alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the number of those attending meetings, there are less than ten thousand people on the whole island meeting with us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This indicates that we have lost many brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the church in Taipei alone more than forty thousand saints have been lost; as far as the whole island is concerned, probably more than ninety thousand people have been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Among these ninety thousand saints, at most ten thousand have gone abroad or passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, based on these results, we have lost contact with approximately eighty thousand saints on this island.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Recently, I heard many testimonies from those in the small group gatherings concerning recovering saints who have not met with us for twenty or thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must spend more effort to find these saints.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we propose that every week at least two hundred information cards should be selected, copied, and sent to various meeting halls in Taipei and even to all the churches in Taiwan so that the saints in the small groups can endeavor to find these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We hope to locate half of them within one to two years.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We lost these brothers and sister because of errors and shortcomings in our old ways.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should rise up and make amends as quickly as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The way to make amends is through the small groups, using the information cards as a base.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although we are greatly encouraged that the church in Taipei has baptized over fifty thousand people in the last twenty-eight years, we must make an effort to find those who have become dormant or lost.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Let us pray for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must endeavor to seek and rescue the saints with whom we have lost contact.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Opening Our Homes to Preach the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>to Our Relatives, Friends, and Neighbors</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We also should open our homes at least once a week to preach the gospel to relatives, friends, and neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we preach to our relatives, friends, and neighbors we will be able to reap a harvest.</S>
