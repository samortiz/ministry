Revelation 4 tells us that God looks like jasper (v. 3). Then Revelation 21 says that the entire New Jerusalem has the appearance of jasper (v. 11). Thus, God&#8217;s redeemed people have become absolutely the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance, but not in His Godhead.<p>We all have to endeavor to reach this high peak. If you think it is too hard to reach this high peak and that the price to pay is too high, be prepared. In the next age, the price will be higher. Sooner or later, you have to be made God, either in the church age or in the coming kingdom age. All of God&#8217;s redeemed people will eventually become gods as the very God in life, in nature, and in appearance but not in the Godhead. The New Jerusalem is the God-men who have been transformed, glorified, and mingled with the processed and consummated Triune God. The holy city will be a mingling to be God&#8217;s increase and expression for eternity. We will enjoy and participate in this divine mingling for eternity.<p>We surely need to be desperate to pray at any cost and to pay the cost just as the apostle Paul did. We should not have the attitude that we are safe in the Lord because we have sacrificed our future and do not love the world. That is not adequate. You must know the intrinsic scene of all the spiritual things. God&#8217;s intention is to make Himself man that man may become Him. Then He and man will be united and mingled together to live a corporate life. Eventually this holy city, Jerusalem, is the aggregate of all the visions and revelations. It is a constitution of the Triune God with the tripartite man. This constitution, the New Jerusalem, will be a pair of lovers in eternity. This pair of lovers are men and God as well. They have become a kind of mutual abode in divinity and humanity. In this humanity, the glory of God will be expressed, manifested, to the uttermost, full of brightness, full of splendor, and full of glory.<p>What shall we do in the light of this revelation? There is no other way to reach this high peak except by praying. It is more than evident that Jerusalem is here as a big realm of Christians, but where is Zion, the overcomers? In the book of Revelation what the Lord wants and what the Lord will build up is Zion, the overcomers. The overcomers are the very Zion, where God is. This is the intrinsic reality of the spiritual revelation in the holy Word of God. We have to realize what the Lord&#8217;s recovery is. The Lord&#8217;s recovery is to build up Zion. Paul&#8217;s writings unveil this to the uttermost, but not many saw this in the past.<p>I do ask you to reverently consider this matter. Paul said that all run in the race, but only one receives the prize. Then he said that we should run in such a way to receive the reward (1 Cor. 9:24). At the end of Paul&#8217;s life he said that he had fought the good fight, finished the course, and kept the faith. He testified that there was a crown of righteousness prepared for him (2 Tim. 4:7-8). I hope that when we end this life, we could say that we have done the same thing. Otherwise, we will be a dropout in the school of the church life. But the Lord will still pick us up in the school of the kingdom age. If we are not perfected in this age, the Lord will spend one thousand years to perfect us. The Lord would even use the second death, which is the fire of the lake of fire, to discipline us (Rev. 2:11). I am thankful to the Lord for the spreading of His recovery, but on the other hand, in these few years my heart is very heavy not only concerning you but also concerning myself.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_018.html">Prev</a> | Next <div style='text-align:center'>Practical Points Concerning Blending &nbsp; pg 19</div><br></body></html>
