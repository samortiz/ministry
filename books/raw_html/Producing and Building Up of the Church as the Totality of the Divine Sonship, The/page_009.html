 <h2 class="head1">THE POSITION AND STANDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING IN THE THIRD HEAVEN</h2>
<p>We may feel that Christ being in the heavens is only for Himself. However, we still have the small phrase <em>to the church.</em> Whatever is in the heavens is to the church. This is not superstitious. It is a heavenly, spiritual fact that Christ our Head has been exalted and is now far above all principalities and powers. Furthermore, all things are under His feet, and He has been given to be Head over all things to the church (1:20-22). We need to declare that all things are under our feet. The more we are bound by our narrow view, the more we are cheated by the enemy. We need a vision to see that we are not on the earth but in the third heaven. This heavenly position is our triumphant victory. When I was young, I desired to be a holy, quiet, and gentle person, but at times I was bothered by my temper. For this reason, I read several books concerning how to overcome sin. Every book provided a way, but none of those ways worked. One day, however, I received the vision that I do not need to overcome my temper. This little &ldquo;bug&rdquo; is already under my feet. The more we try to overcome sin, the more we will be underneath it. We need a vision to see that we are attached to the ascended Head. Our position is in the exaltation of Christ, and because we are attached to the exalted Christ, we are far above all the negative things. We should not consider whether we have seen this vision. We should simply say, &ldquo;Praise You, Lord Jesus. You are the exalted Christ, and Your exaltation is to the church, including me.&rdquo; If we thank the Lord in this way, we will be released. We will see that we are in the third heaven and that everything is under our feet.</p>
<p>The exaltation of Christ operates for the church. The proper church life is not a matter on the earth. It is something in resurrection and ascension. Many Christians do not have this vision, but we need to gain it. This is the full gospel, a gospel that includes not only the death and resurrection of Christ but also His ascension. Not many today preach the ascended Christ. Every preacher speaks of the death of Christ, and many also preach the resurrection of Christ, but it is difficult to find someone who preaches concerning the ascension of Christ. Our Christ is not only the crucified and resurrected Christ; He is also the ascended, exalted Christ. We must all see this. On the day of Pentecost when Peter stood to preach, He preached not from the earth but from the third heaven to the people on the earth. The third heaven is the position of the church. In His death Christ has dealt with all the negative things, and in His resurrection He regenerated us so that we may have the divine life and nature. Now in His exaltation and ascension we have a heavenly position and standing. We are the church both in resurrection and in ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST GIVING GIFTS TO THE CHURCH<br />
FOR THE FUNCTION OF HIS MEMBERS</h2>
<p>In His ascension Christ also received gifts from the Father and gave them to the Body for its building up (Psa. 68:18; Eph. 4:7-8, 11-16). These gifts include each of us as His members. Some Christians feel that it is sufficient simply to go to a Lord&rsquo;s Day morning &ldquo;service,&rdquo; because this does not require them to do anything. They do not need to pray, speak, or even sing. They can simply sit and relax while a hired pastor and a choir do everything for them. In the church life, however, the brothers and sisters realize that they need to function, but they may still feel that it is difficult to function. One Lord&rsquo;s Day morning I received the burden to tell the saints that we can all function. I said, &ldquo;At least you can speak four words.&rdquo; Then I considered what four words I should tell them to speak. I said, &ldquo;You can all say, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; Since that time, speaking these four words has helped many saints to function. By saying &ldquo;O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!&rdquo; many brothers and sisters have been stirred up.</p>
<p>We should not be silent and dead. Rather, we need to shout, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. Praise the Lord!&rdquo; Every member of our physical body has a function and is a gift to the body. Even our little finger is a precious gift to our body. We should not say that we are too small. Being small does not mean that we have nothing. We all have something, even if it is small. The reason we do not function as members of the living Body of Christ is that we are short of the vision of Christ&rsquo;s ascension. Christ&rsquo;s ascension indicates His triumphant victory over all things. We must not be bothered by anything. We must say, &ldquo;I am in the third heaven.&rdquo; When we say this, our function will immediately come out. If we see the vision of Christ&rsquo;s exaltation, we will be stirred up to speak for the Lord. We should not consider what to say; we should simply speak, because we will have something to say. Christ&rsquo;s ascension not only lifts us above all the negative things, but it also affords us our function. When we see the vision of Christ&rsquo;s exaltation, we realize that we are gifts, and we have something to speak. Our silence is due to our lack of the heavenly vision concerning Christ&rsquo;s exaltation. We should read the New Testament again, especially the Epistles of Paul, in order to see the extent of Christ&rsquo;s ascension and exaltation.</p>
<p>The church is not merely a group of religious or ethical people who are learning how to be moral and have good behavior. This is what the disciples of Confucius do. We are the members of the ascended Christ. Therefore, we do not need mere doctrinal teachings; we need a vision. Teachings alone do not avail to bring forth our function. When I was young, I observed how in nearly every wedding the pastor read Ephesians 5:21-25 to exhort the new couple. He would say to the husband, &ldquo;From today on, you must love your wife at any cost. Do you agree to this?&rdquo; Then he would say to the bride, &ldquo;You must realize that from today on, you are no longer the head. You must promise to submit to your husband for the rest of your life.&rdquo; However, after only a short time the husband could not love his wife, and the wife could not submit to her husband. Regardless of how much the pastor charges a bridegroom and a bride, mere teachings do not avail. After I was called by the Lord into the ministry in the church life, young brothers and sisters would come to me asking for help in their marriage. At first I followed the example I had learned, and I would read Ephesians 5:21-25 with them, but I eventually learned that this did not work. When I contacted the Lord, He adjusted me and led me to read verse 18, which says, &ldquo;Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.&rdquo; In ourselves we cannot love our wife or submit to our husband, but when we are filled in our spirit with God, with the Spirit as the heavenly wine, it is easy for us to love and to submit. It is a matter not of duty but of being filled. It is the filling of the Holy Spirit in our spirit that avails.</p>
<p>Today we have the filling of the Spirit, and we also have the ascension and exaltation of Christ. May the Lord open the heavens to us that we may see that we are not only on the earth but also in the heavens. We are now in the heavens in the exaltation of Christ, and everything is under our feet. Moreover, we are all qualified and equipped to function by speaking for the Lord. We must not be timid and say that we cannot function. If we see the vision of Christ&rsquo;s ascension, we will be equipped and gifted. All negative things will be under our feet, and we will be released to function, pray, shout, and say Hallelujah!</p>
