   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED TO RAISE UP THE NEW BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We go to the sinners to bring the gospel to them and infuse them with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then these sinners become children of God and members of Christ 1 Cor 12:12, 27; Eph 5:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We offer them to God, and they become the sacrifices in our priesthood Rom 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through our preaching, through our priesthood of the gospel, they are regenerated, converted from sinners to sons of God, and these sons of God are the many brothers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His many brothers are His many members which compose His organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the first step of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to consider the new believers as our babes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As newborn babes they desire the milk of the Word that they may grow unto salvation 1 Pet 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For their initial salvation they needed to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But now for their continuous salvation, they need growth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They grow by being fed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We, the New Testament priests, have to take the responsibility to go back to their homes to have home meetings with them just for feeding them, like a nursing mother feeding her little babe for a certain period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In today's society, mothers take care of their babies at home for a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then when they are about three or four years of age, they are considered as preschool children.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Right after this they will be in kindergarten.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>From kindergarten they progress through elementary, junior high, high school, and college.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These are the stages for their perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For anyone to become a proper person, there is the need of perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the United States, one cannot do much with only a high school education.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He must at least have a trade.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If possible, it is better for a person to get a four-year college education.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Better still, he could go to graduate school for two years to get a master's degree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even this is not as good as studying a few more years in order to earn a Ph.D. This is considered the peak of a proper education in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is necessary to be properly educated.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Using the biblical terminology, this means the growing saints have to be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Previously they were sinners, but through our visiting them with the gospel, they opened up their hearts and were infused with Christ through the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He got into them, and they were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regeneration transfers sinners out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In Adam they were fallen sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now they have been transferred through regeneration into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Christ they are no longer sinners, but they are the sons of God, the children of God, the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God, Christ Rom 8:16, 29; Heb 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These new brothers of Christ are also the members of His mystical, organic Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Still, they are infants.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They do not yet know how to eat, so we have to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After we baptize them into the Triune God, we have to go back to their homes as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we invite them to come to a meeting, they may be unable because they are infants.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to go to their homes to have home meetings with them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This practice is seen in the book of Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After the three thousand were saved on the day of Pentecost, they began to meet in their homes immediately Acts 2:41-42, 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The purpose of their meeting in the homes was so that they could be fed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This continued among them for a period of time Acts 2:46-47; 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>INCITING ONE ANOTHER BY SPEAKING</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In each of the local churches, there should be some advanced ones who have been perfected by the gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now they should continue the perfecting through their fellowship with the newly saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, all the saints in a local church should speak a heavenly language that newborn babes can learn to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We all know that every child in any home picks up the language of that home.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I came to this country, I noticed that different regions had different expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They all spoke English, but they had different ways of expressing the English language.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first time I was invited to Tyler, Texas, I heard the expression "y'all."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I did not realize what "y'all" meant.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later, I found out that it was the Texan way to say "you all."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Language is very contagious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What our babes will speak depends on what we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can we incite one another without speaking?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we come to the meeting and sit silently, will this be an inciting?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Inciting surely requires our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>One may say, "Did you read the Bible this morning?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even this much speaking will incite the hearers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They may go back home with a burden to rise up early in the morning to read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we all speak in a meeting, we consider that a good meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we do not participate in speaking in a particular meeting, we may feel that the meeting was not so good.</S>
