   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A LETTER FROM WANG T'AN CH'I</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings in love to my brother in the Lord, Mr. Watchman:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I really miss you because we are so far apart.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I often think of writing you, but since my business is very busy, I do not have time to put a pen to paper and communicate with you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am very sorry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I can only fellowship with you in my prayer before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I listened to messages for six or seven years, and I was a preacher for one year, but I still did not know whether or not I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Fortunately, you came to Changchow in 1928 to lead a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I went to the meeting with my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were touched from beginning to end and we knew about salvation for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were so happy in our hearts that we wept.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I stood up in the meeting to testify and consecrate myself for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, our economic situation was very tight because we were very poor and I had been a preacher for one year.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, I went into business.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I wanted to have some savings for our family before I began to work by preaching full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I was not able to do what I wanted after consecrating myself in the meeting because of my home situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fortunately, I began working for the Hsia Yu Feng Bank the year before last.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are closed on the Lord's Day, so I could use the time to help the church in Amoy and comfort myself some.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But since coming to Shih Ma Wai City to work last year, I have had too much to do.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do not have any time from morning to evening.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I cannot take a break on the Lord's Day either.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My heart is suffering greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I do not get out of business, it will be difficult for me to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But I feel that I cannot do this because my family is still very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Consequently, I have placed this matter before the Lord to ask for His leading.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the same time, I am asking you, brother, to trouble yourself and give me some guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is my hope.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have received much benefit from your teaching in The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I have also come to know the condition of the meeting in Shanghai through them and that the Lord has raised up many of His children to obey Him in every place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I rejoice much because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I received a card on the twenty-second of this month that said you had been married on the nineteenth on Tung Chieh Road in Hangchow.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was very comforted to know this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I only hate that I did not find out sooner; therefore, I was unable to make preparations to attend the ceremony myself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you are willing, please give me some advice.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is my greatest hope.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am so full of emotions that it is hard for me to say everything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I will tell you more later.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Greetings to the brothers and sisters in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Mailing Address: Yu Yu Bank, Shih Ma Wai City</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE HISTORY OF BROTHER WITNESS LEE'S WORK</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>IN THE REGION OF P'ING YANG, CHEKIANG PROVINCE One</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Greetings to Mr. Nee and the brothers and sisters</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>who meet on Hardoon Road:</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Mr. Witness Lee arrived in Sha Chiang at 8:00 p.m. on the thirteenth and spent the night in the brothers' meeting place in Fang Yen.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At 6:00 a.m. on the fourteenth, he took a small boat to Wu Shih Ling and walked fifteen miles to Ts'ao Hsi where he had lunch in a brother's home.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>After 2:00 p.m., he went on by sedan chair.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It was pouring rain and stormy; the curtains on the sedan chair were soaked and even Mr. Lee's clothes and shoes were wet.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In addition, the mountains were high and the slopes were steep.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The sedan chair was tossed and pulled by the winds.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The bearers of the chair almost fell down several times.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This journey was long and continued until the end of the day, and it became dark on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was difficult for the bearers to take each step.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If the Lord's grace had not sustained, the danger would have been unimaginable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We arrived in Fan Shan a little after 8:00 p.m. The brothers welcomed us with much love.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The next day we went from Fan Shan to Ma Chan and met with the brothers for a short time in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the evening we had a fellowship meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The formal meetings did not start until today.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>About six hundred people attended the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Mr. Lee is bearing the responsibility for speaking the messages.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He speaks two times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today he spoke on how the believers should love and serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many brothers and sisters were very touched that they did not have a heart that loves the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They wept.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Starting tomorrow he will speak a series of messages on the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We expect that the loving Lord will bless us greatly through these messages.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We will tell you the rest later.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Peace in the Lord!</S>
