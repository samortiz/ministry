   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many people today think that even though salvation is of God's grace, we should, nevertheless, have our work.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They think that God's grace should be supplemented with our work before we can be saved; otherwise, we will still perish.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Alas, the man in the flesh always wants to be saved by his own self!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should remember the words in Romans 11:6: "But if by grace, it is no longer out of works..."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Grace and work cannot stand side by side.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Either we have grace or we have work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can never have grace and work at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"Otherwise..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here the apostle speaks from the negative angle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If one mixes grace with work, then "grace is no longer grace."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's boundless, incomparable, royal grace, if supplemented by man's ragged works, will become something unseemly and awkward.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man's work will not accomplish God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On the contrary, it will make grace "no longer grace."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, sinners, if you want to be saved, you must never think that you should do good, or that doing good will help you to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You should humble yourselves and acknowledge that you are helpless sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You should accept God's grace with faith and thanksgiving; by His Son's accomplishment on the cross, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wonderful grace is given freely to sinners!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We can look again at God's Word to see how good works cannot save.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"A man is not justified out of works...we might be justified...not out of the works of law, because out of the works of law no flesh will be justified" Gal 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"For as many as are of the works of law are under a curse" 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"By law no one is justified before God" v. 11 . I have told you that the meaning of keeping the law is to do good.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be justified by the law means to be saved through works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What do these few verses say?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who are saved are not saved through doing good.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only will they not be saved through doing good, but they will be cursed if they want to be saved through good works!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible tells us explicitly that no one is saved through good works.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If that is the case, why struggle to do something that can never be achieved?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Friends, here is the Lord Jesus' accomplished work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has paid all the price, and has been crucified on the cross for your sake.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You do not need to mournfully seek for salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has accomplished His work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you receive what He has accomplished, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why struggle in your own ways?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Believe in Him!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After you believe in Him, praise Him because He has so loved you and has prepared salvation for you!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There are two verses which explain the question of salvation clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can take a look at them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast" Eph 2:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After reading these two verses, we should realize that they concern the question of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why in the first sentence there is the expression "you have been saved."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This clearly concerns salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How are you saved?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Is it by good works?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No. Is it because you are stronger than others? No. How then is man saved? The Bible tells us that salvation is by two things: God's grace and man's faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"By grace you have been saved through faith" 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Grace is given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has prepared a Savior for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He has "caused the iniquity of us all to fall on Him" Isa 53:6 by sending Him to the cross to die and bear all the punishment for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through His suffering and bearing pain for us and by drinking the cup of God's righteous wrath, He accomplished a full salvation for us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How great is this grace!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is God's grace; it is the basis of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Man can render no help; He has accomplished everything on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God has now prepared salvation and presented it before us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Salvation is placed before every sinner it is placed before you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have seen God's grace manifested on the cross of Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But how can we be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not by doing good or by mortifying ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Neither is it by improvement or by attending church services.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"By grace you have been saved through faith" Eph 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Now we come to another aspect of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No doubt God gives grace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Even though God gives grace, we cannot be saved unless we believe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The immense grace of God prepared a death-substituting salvation on the cross of Calvary for us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must believe in Him before we can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>What is the meaning of believing?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To believe is to receive John 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God has prepared the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When we receive it, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If a man gives you something precious, it is yours when you receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you receive the grace of salvation which God gives you, grace will be yours, and you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I must persuade you not to delay but to receive Him now.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I wish that you would stretch out the hand of faith and accept God's great grace to you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here is an illustration: a rich man saw many poor people about to die of cold in snowy winter weather.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He became very charitable and began to investigate the names and addresses of many of the poor people.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Then he ordered his servant to go out with a carriage full of coal to give to them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>His servant accordingly took the carriage, and when he reached the first door, he asked if that house was the right number on the right street and if the name of the person living there was so-and-so.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When the person who opened the door said yes, the servant told him that his master had sent him to offer coal.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The poor man thought that this was a mistake; he thought that he did not have such a kind friend.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>As a result he closed his door to the servant.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The servant could not do anything but go to another door.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The man at the second door also thought that he did not have such a kind friend.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although the servant used many words to convince him, he was still doubtful and would not accept the coal.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The servant had to go to another house.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This happened at the next few houses.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>None of the people in those houses had faith.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>They all thought that there could not be such a kind person who would buy coal and give it away for free.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>They would not accept the coal.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Later the servant went to the house of a widow.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When she learned of the intention of the servant, she gladly received the coal and thanked the master.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>With the coal she was able to pass through that winter.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Friends, this is the way with God's grace; it is absolutely free.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Now the servant of the master has sent the Lord's salvation to the door of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If you would receive it, you will enjoy the joy of this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Do not follow the example of the doubting ones, who simply inflicted sufferings on themselves and lost their opportunity forever!</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>You only need to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>You do not need to do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Once you receive, it is yours.</S>
