Ephesians 3:10-11 unveils the fact that the existence of the church is according to the eternal purpose of God which He purposed in Christ
God planned to have a corporate Body, a corporate vessel, with which He could mingle Himself and all that He is
Even the three Persons of the Godhead are for the divine purpose of having a church to fulfill God's eternal plan
If you could visit him at his home in the early hours of the day, you would see that He is a father or a husband
The father in the home, the professor in the university, and the doctor in the hospital are also three persons with one name
The purpose of this is that God Himself may be dispensed into us and applied so that the church may be produced and exist
In order that the church may exist in this universe to express God the heavens the earth space and a multitude of other items are required
For the producing of the church, there is also the need of a tripartite man, a man with three parts-spirit, soul, and body
God, creation, and man are all for the church; so eventually we see that the church is the center, the kernel of God's eternal plan
We know why the creation of the heavens and the earth and so many billions of items is necessary and why mankind was brought into existence
We know what is the dispensation of the mystery which has been hidden in God from the beginning of the creation
Ephesians 4:11-12 tells us that all the gifted persons-the apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers-are for the church
One is at the beginning of the New Testament in the Book of Matthew, and the other is at the end in the Book of Revelation
In the first book of the New Testament, He spoke about the building of the church; and what He began He will accomplish
In the beginning He spoke about the universal church, but practically speaking, when He comes to the end, it is the local churches
In saying that the body is the expression, we must realize that the body is always one with the head in life and in nature
Christ is not only the Head, but He is also the Body, because the Body's life is Christ and the Body's nature is Christ
She is something that came out of Christ, something produced of Christ and something which is a part of Christ
Today the church is simply the Body to Christ, a Body that is produced out of Christ and a Body that is part of Christ
When all the riches of Christ have been enjoyed and assimilated by us, then we will have the issue of the enjoyment of Christ's riches
If we only learn the teachings and doctrines, it is just like learning the recipe and the menu without enjoying the food
The adequate way for us to express Christ is to feed upon Him, eat of Him, drink of Him and be filled with Him as our nourishment
A local church is an expression of Christ, and this expression can only exist by taking Christ as our enjoyment
For throughout the centuries, in many cases, the more people have learned the teachings, the more they have been divided
We all must learn day by day to enjoy these unsearchable riches; then we will know what we must minister to others
It should not be our intention to pass on teachings; we must be burdened simply to minister something of the riches of Christ to others
If we are going to have a proper expression of the church in any locality, we need the real enjoyment of the riches of Christ
The church must be filled with the enjoyment of the riches of Christ; then we will have the riches of glory for God to inherit
When Christ Himself is enjoyed by us, we will have the church as the real house of God and the pillar and ground of the truth, the reality
The church is the pillar and ground to bear Christ and to show to the whole universe that everything is false but Christ
Many people talk about the church as the expression of Christ, but after a little consideration we will ask, 'Where is the church'?
When people speak about the church as the expression of Christ, it sounds nice, but we must put nice things into practice
The teachers may tell us that it is too spiritual and that it is not something of this earth, but in the heavens
There is no reason for us to have the church today, and it is needless to talk about the things of the church today
Revelation 1:11 tells us that in the province of Asia there were at least seven local churches in seven cities
If we read Matthew 18 carefully, we will see that two or three cannot be the church if there are more believers in one locality
If he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established
All the groups are in the same city, and in some places the different meetings are not distant from one another
The Lord has really answered their prayers, they say, and they have brought a good number of people to the Lord
We see that without the limitation of the unique local church, we are free to behave as we like, and there is no lesson for us to learn
Many times we had something we wanted to do, but because of the limitation and restriction of the church we could not get through
We felt somewhat unhappy at the time, but later, when we looked back, we had to say, 'Lord, how we thank Thee!
By the Lord's wisdom and sovereignty, wherever there is a local church, that must be the unique expression of the Lord's Body in that city
It is this unique expression of the church in every locality that is a lesson and restriction to us, as well as a protection
Many messages and books encourage people to meet freely in their homes, on the campus, in the factories and in so many quarters
People simply do not have the concept of the local church as the unique expression of the Lord's Body in their locality
We need to have our eyes opened, for if we have not seen the local church, we are in darkness and under a blindfold
We must not be influenced by the present situation of today's Christianity, but come back to the pure Word of the Lord
When we say the practicality of the church, we do not mean the spirituality of the church, for this also is Christ
There have been many teachings and writings concerning the church, the Body of Christ, over a period of many years
If in any locality there is not a local church, regardless of how much we talk about the church, we do not have the practicality
The church in Los Angeles may not be as marvelous as that mentioned in Matthew 16:18, but we have it and we enjoy it!
The second and third times that the word 'church' is used are in 8:1 and 3 , 'the church which was at Jerusalem'
The fourth mentioning is in Acts 9:31, 'Then had the churches rest throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria'
The church mentioned in 11:22 is 'the church which was in Jerusalem,' and that mentioned in 11:26 is the church at Antioch
In 15:3-4, it was the church at Antioch that brought Paul and Barnabas on their way and the church at Jerusalem that received them
It was written to the seven local churches in Asia and reveals that the Lord Jesus is in the midst of the local churches
In the local church there is the government which is a real restriction and real test to our flesh and our natural self
We do praise the Lord that in these past few years, we have really experienced the practicality of the church life
Timothy 3:15 says that we need to know how to behave ourselves in the house of God, which is the church of the living God
The following is the best translation: 'In whom all the building, fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord
It seems that verse 21 is quite adequate: 'In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord'
Bible teachers have always said that the book of Ephesians is not about the local church, but the universal church
They are right in that this book covers the universal aspect of the church, but it still deals with the local church
In Ephesians chapter four, the seven one's are divided into three groups, and every group has one of the three Persons of the Godhead
The oneness of the church is nothing but the Triune God, the very God in three Persons dispensed into us for the forming of the Body
According to the order of the Persons of the Godhead, God the Father is first, then the Lord, and then the Spirit
According to the formation of the Body in our experience, the Spirit is first, then the Lord, and then God the Father
When we believe, we believe into Christ, and when we are buried in baptism, this burial terminates all our old relations
The faith is composed of the things that save us if we believe in them, such as the Person and the redemptive work of Christ
In today's Christianity there are many doctrines such as head covering, foot washing, baptism by immersion or sprinkling, etc
We must contend for 'the faith,' the saving faith, not for any doctrine that has nothing to do with our salvation
If we insist on sprinkling or immersion and make it a part of our faith, we become a sprinkling 'church' or an immersion 'church'
In order to keep the unity of the faith and not be carried away by the wind of doctrine, we need the growth in life
As long as people take the Word of God and praise the Lord, regardless of the way we prefer that they do it, we should not oppose them
On the other hand, if we insist on these things and impose them upon others, we go too far in the other direction
Since we have seen that the local church is the practical expression of the church, we should not insist on anything but the faith
If a sister feels she does not need to have her head covered, she should be left to act according to her own feeling in this matter
We must grow and grow in life until we drop all the toys of different doctrines or teachings and 'all arrive at the unity of the faith'
For the Lords recovery of the genuine Body life we need the genuine oneness which is both the unity of the Spirit and the unity of the faith
Most every building has a foundation, and the main part of the foundation of most buildings is underneath the ground
We know that in Jerusalem, a temple was built according to the design revealed by God and with all the materials designated by God
The three temples outside of Jerusalem would be the same as that in Jerusalem, but they would be on the wrong ground
Would you stay in Babylon with the spiritual prophet Daniel, or would you go back to Jerusalem with those poor ones?
It was not until the destroyed temple was built in Jerusalem, even though it was not up to standard, that the glory of God filled it
Because a building was erected on the proper ground, even though it was under the standard, the Shekinah glory of God was manifested
When we read the four Gospels, we see how poor and pitiful the state of the Lord's people was in Israel when the Lord was born
Since there was now a church at Antioch , spontaneously the city of Antioch became the ground of the church there
One has the Apollonian ground, one has the Petrine ground, one has the Pauline ground, and one even says that Christ is their ground
Since they do not like pray-reading, we had better not speak with them about it, but be so strong in our spirit
We must not bring anything to any place, and we must not stand for anything but Christ and the church on the proper ground
As long as the church is on the proper ground, regardless of how poor and weak she is, we must be one with her
The majority of Christians will not take the proper ground, but the Lord will still raise up a remnant to stand on the ground of unity
We all have our own tastes and our own concepts in so many matters; but if we are in our opinions and our concepts, we only cause trouble
He said, 'Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth'
If you eat all things, do not despise those who do not; if you do not eat all things, do not criticize those who do
Concerning the keeping of days, the Apostle said, 'One esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike
He did not say whether esteeming one day above another is right, or whether esteeming every day alike is right
He only said, 'He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it'
It is by keeping the unity of Christ that the church is enriched; it is the unity of doctrines or different opinions that damages the Body
There is no need for us either to oppose or impose anything other than the Lord as life and the church as His expression
The Body life of chapter 12 requires the liberal and general attitude of chapter 14 that its unity may be kept
The proper way to have the church life is simply to have Christ as the foundation upon the proper ground of unity
If we are strong in the spirit and full of Christ, it will be easy for us to go on with the local church, caring not for other things
As long as the church in our city is on the proper ground of unity, we will be one with it and minister Christ in it
When they go to another place, they will be very critical if people do not practice the Lord's Table as they do
As long as the saints love the Lord and come together on the proper ground of unity to minister Christ to one another, that is sufficient
Though we may not agree with them in certain things, we should not impose anything upon them or insist upon anything
If we are in a position to make a decision regarding certain things, perhaps we would not proceed in the same way
If we are special in anything and insist upon that, we will probably not receive those who differ from us in certain matters
Any saint who holds a different opinion or concept regarding the things of which we are in favor we must receive for God hath received him
If our receiving differs from His, it means that we are wrong: either we are more narrow or more broad than God
God's receiving is based upon Christ's receiving, and Christ's receiving is in accordance with our faith in Him
Acts 14:23 says that elders are ordained in every church, but Titus 1:5 says that elders are ordained in every city
To ordain elders in every church is not to ordain elders in every home or in any other kind of place, but in every city
Send it unto the seven churches which are in Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamos, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea
Why would Acts 14:23 say to ordain elders in every church and then Titus 1:5 say to ordain elders in every city?
In Revelation 1:11 the Lord Jesus makes it extremely clear that a local church is equal to the city in which it is located
Before 1828, the year in which the Brethren were raised up, the concept of the church being local had not been seen clearly by Christianity
After 1828, the Brethren, under the leadership of John Nelson Darby, began to see that the church must be local
The Brethren began to have their local assemblies, and the term 'local assembly,' or 'local church' began to be used
When some brothers in their assemblies have felt unhappy with others, they have left and started another meeting
By so doing he came to see that the boundary of a local church is the boundary of the city in which the church is located
It was by 1937 that this became clear to us all, and it was at this time that the term 'the ground of the church' was first used
From that time till now, there has been no further improvement in this simply because it cannot be improved upon
We must all realize that the church in the entire universe is one Body; thus, regarding the church there is a real oneness
The many consulates of the United States throughout the world as her many expressions do not mean that she is divided
If in London today there were two consulates of the United States, it would mean that the United States is divided
Regardless of the size of a city, as long as a consulate of the United States is there, that consulate must be uniquely one
Formerly, the number of different kinds of expressions of the church was smaller, but now it has been greatly increased
Many know that the large denominations are divisive and sectarian, but they simply do not realize the divisiveness of the small groups
It may be that they are not clear that the ground of the church does not depend upon the condition of the church
Today we may be very spiritual, but after two months we may not be so spiritual; and after two years, we may be worse
After this, he returns home to consider the whole situation and eventually decides that he will not go there anymore
They meet in the name of the Lord, and they can even give testimony of how the Lord has heard their prayers and is guiding them
Regardless of how poor and how weak and how short of Christ the church in San Francisco is that is the unique church according to the ground
Later another American comes to Tokyo and goes to the American consulate, and he also is offended by the poor service
He meets the two Americans who started another consulate in their home and they ask him to come and see how good their American consulate is
You may think that this is ridiculous, but have you ever realized that this is exactly the situation of today's Christianity?
We know that at least 13 million Hebrew people exist on the earth today, but only about two million have gone back to the Holy Land
Regardless of how good those in New York are, they can never fulfill the Lord's purpose, for they are not on the ground of their nation
It is only by the ground that we can learn the lessons we need in order to experience the reality and practicality of the church life
The types are pictures of that which is revealed in the New Testament, and a picture, we know, is better than a thousand words
A lengthy definition of a certain matter may still not make the matter clear, but when we look at a picture, it is immediately clear to us
The Old Testament gives us the pictures, which are called the types; then the New Testament gives the definitions
If we are not clear regarding certain points in the definition, we can go back to the picture and compare the picture with the definition
The manna in the wilderness is a type of one aspect of Christ, and the rock in the wilderness is a type of another aspect of Christ
There is another way, and that is the enjoyment of the riches of the good land as a corporate worship to the Lord
They have no right to enjoy this ten percent in any place they choose; they must bring it to the place which the Lord has chosen
We may enjoy Christ in a private way with the ninety percent, but we cannot enjoy Christ as the firstfruit and topmost portion
Whenever we come together on the proper ground, which is the ground ordained by the Lord, we enjoy the topmost portion of the rich Christ
Of course, everything of Christ is good, but there is still a difference between the firstfruit and the remainder
There are only two ways to enjoy Christ: the individual way and the corporate way, the personal way and the Body way
There they met with all the people of Israel to put all the offerings together as an exhibition of the rich produce of the good land
We should enjoy Christ in a personal, individual way, but we still need to enjoy Him even more in a corporate, Body way
With the individual way of enjoying Christ there is no problem, but with the corporate way there is a real problem
Why was there only one place for all the people to come together to have the corporate enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land?
In Deuteronomy 12, 14, 15, and 16 the Lord says many times that the people of Israel must worship at the place He chooses
If the standing of the church is not according to the ground, but according to the so-called spiritual condition, nothing will be stable
Can anyone show from the Acts or the Epistles that one of the Apostles did any work apart from that of building up the local churches?
All the Apostles went forth with the full intention of establishing, edifying and building up the local churches
The only thing in which you may say that the church on the proper ground is narrow is that it will not take anything divisive
If we are on the proper ground, we can never be narrow, for the ground of unity is common to all the people of the Lord
We are working to build up the local church, but you have been sent by your mission to come here to build up the church of your mission
In order that we may be definitely clear concerning the local church , we must see the matter of the church in the home
At that time in Rome, there was only one house where there was a church, and that was the house of Aquila and Priscilla
There were not two churches in Rome, one called the church in Rome and another which met in the house of Aquila and Priscilla
If we read these verses carefully, we will see that the church in the house of Nymphas was the church in Laodicea
Whenever we come to this point regarding the ground of the church, there is always a sense that we are fighting against something
The natural, human, religious concept is a veil that covers us and keeps us from seeing the ground of the church
If we are only willing to be shown the local church on the right ground, the way will be opened for the Lord's mercy and grace to flood in
They say, 'Yes, the denominations are wrong and we should not be sectarian, but still it is rather difficult to have the local church
Wherever the Lord can find even a few on this earth who are so absolute for the local church, He will pour out His blessing upon them
In 1937 an American brother was really seeking the Lord, and due to his seeking he was persecuted by the other missionaries of his mission
When a person is so absolute and burdened with the vision concerning the local church, he will pray prevailingly
If you go to a place where there is a meeting, but there is a question regarding the ground they take, it may not be the local church!
We know that ointment in typology is the Holy Spirit, the third Person of the Godhead in God's divine dispensation
One aspect is likened to the ointment upon a body, and the other is likened to the dew which falls upon a place
When we are in unity, the ointment flows on the Body, and the dew falls from heaven upon the dwelling place of God
Those of us who have been meeting in Los Angeles have really tasted something of this ointment and dew in our practical experience
At the same time, accompanying the flow of the Spirit, is a kind of watering just as dew, so strengthening and so refreshing
In the church life, there is the sweet and gracious flow of the Spirit, and at the same time, there is the watering and refreshing dew
The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all
At the same time we sense the strengthening within, the watering, the refreshing, the comforting and empowering
Many today excuse themselves by saying that it was easy in the time of the Apostles, but now it is not so easy
According to the record of the New Testament, to keep the unity in Jerusalem was easy, for there were no other divisions
The church in Corinth was divided into four groups: one of Paul, another of Cephas, another of Apollos, and another 'of Christ'
If we went to the group of Cephas or Apollos, or even to the one that is 'of Christ,' the result would be the same
If you are really absolute and mean business with the Lord, you will experience the Lord commanding the blessing of life upon you
Luke 21:24 says that Jerusalem will be trodden under the feet of the Gentiles until the fullness of the time of the Gentiles
Regardless of the background, if they are saved, they all have the same faith, for they all believe in the same Lord Jesus Christ
We have fellowship with one another because we all have the same divine life, we all have the same Lord, and we all have the same redemption
As long as they are saints who are not sinful according to 1Corinthians 5, we must recognize all of them as dear brothers and sisters
The problem is this: if one believes in a certain kind of rapture, he will try day and night to convince others of this doctrine
We should not look down upon them for speaking in tongues, and they should not look down upon us for not speaking in tongues
We may practice certain things because they help us, but we should not make any practice a basis for our fellowship
We told the dear ones who tried to adjust us that as far as we were concerned, it was quite all right for them to do things in their way
We may practice many things for the Lord, yet we should not make any one of these things the basis for fellowship
When we practice the church life and take the standing of the unique ground of unity, we must not particularize in any thing
The problem is that if the church does not take your opinion or your way, you will say that the church is narrow
As long as we all believe in the same Lord and are on the ground of unity, any kind of practice which is not sinful is tolerable
We can never be identified with all the Lord's people today, because so many will not obey the Lord to come back to the ground of unity
In the last chapter we have seen something regarding the attitude we must have toward the saints who are still in the denominations
On the other hand, if they are still in the denominations, it is rather difficult for us to identify ourselves with them
Now we must see some of the practical lessons of the church life that we may know how to behave in the local church
When we leave the denominations and come to the ground of unity we must learn immediately that we are not for any doctrine form or practice
You discover that a group of believers are meeting on the proper ground in Sacramento and you proceed to meet with them
If you go there to criticize their pray-reading and everything they do, you will only damage yourself and the church
If you cannot go along with those where you are, you will never be able to go along with those in other places
Wherever we are in a local church, regardless of how wrong they are, we must go along with them as long as they are not sinful
Of course, if the leading brothers put up an idol and say that we all must worship it, we must stand against this because it is sinful
Whether we are an elder or a deacon does not really mean anything as long as we minister Christ as life to others
We should just minister Christ continually to others without saying a word about the brothers who are taking the lead
We must simply love the Lord and the church and learn to minister Christ as life to others and receive help in life from others
We must realize that all the divisions with their forms, knowledge and doctrines work together to damage the function of the church
He uses divisions, forms, doctrines, teachings and knowledge to kill the functions of the Body and to paralyze it
Suppose five hundred brothers and sisters are meeting in Los Angeles on the church ground and 99 percent of them fail to function
They must be a social group, a religious society, or a kind of organization, for the people are put together without functioning
It is based upon the unity, the life, and the fellowship that we function, and the real function is the real building up
In Ephesians 4:7-16, we see that the Head does not build up the local church, which is the expression of the Body of Christ, directly
He builds the local church through the gifted persons such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and pastors and teachers
Without this victory, Christ the Head has no position to give gifts to the Body so that we can have the different functions
After resurrection, while He was ascending into the heavens, He led a train of vanquished foes who had been defeated by Him
If they will surrender to Christ and let Him lead them in His train of defeated foes, they will be the first to pray in the meetings
Ephesians 4:11 says, 'And he gave some apostles, and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers'
When you are willing to be subdued and captured by Him, you will give Him the ground to give you the gift and establish you as a teacher
Our two eyes and our two arms are gifts to our body, but the capacity of the eyes to receive blood is much smaller than that of the arms
The more we grow in life, the more we will receive the life supply and the more this life supply will afford us the function
If we refer Ephesians 4 to Psalm 68 we see that there was a battle fought by Christ in the universe and Christ has defeated all His enemies
The Lord's intention is to give you as a gift to the Body, but if you would not be captured by Him, He can never establish you as a gift
They may pay the price to give up the denominations and come back to Jerusalem to take the ground of unity in the local church
Do not think that the elders in the church must be persons with certain natural qualifications and capabilities
There was a man who was highly educated and qualified in government work and whom some of the brothers were trying to bring to the Lord
The brothers told Brother Watchman Nee that if such a man with his qualifications were saved, surely he would be the best for the church
What the church needs are those who have been captured, subdued, conquered, fully possessed by Christ, and then growing in Him in all things
When you come to the meeting of the church and pray something regarding the Lord, all the brothers and sisters must sense the flow of life
When you go to visit a family, perhaps you will not say much, but if life flows out you will water and refresh them
If you have the gift of an apostle or prophet, you should not replace the saints, but do a perfecting work to perfect the saints
We need some brothers to be full time experts; the rest simply do not have the time to take care of the church service
You also must give up the concept of getting help from others, but go to the meetings to minister something yourself
When all of the members function, we will become a living organism, fighting the battle for the Lord's recovery
May the Lord be merciful to us that we all may be so willing and aggressive to have the proper functions in the church
We have pointed out that if we are going to have the proper function in the local church, we need first of all to be captured by Christ
They are not good for the expression of Christ, because the expression of Christ is simply Christ manifested through His members
The above verses in Ephesians and Colossians set forth a number of principles concerning our function in the church
Do not think that you are something in the church because you have the highest attainment in education and religion
In the new man, the Body of Christ, there are no Gentiles and no Hebrews, no religious and no unreligious, no cultured and no uncultured
We all need to be captured by Christ, to grow in Him, and to walk in Him by putting off whatever we are and whatever we have attained
The more we exercise our arm or any other part of our body, the more it will be strengthened, for the more blood that member will receive
There is a brother in the church in Los Angeles who has been very active in functioning since the day he was saved six months ago
We all have some Christian background that has influenced us: we are used to coming to the church and sitting as pew members
Not only must we learn to put off worldly and sinful things, but also all our religious and educational attainments
Last night it was in the Spirit, but now it becomes a kind of letter because the spirit is not released-only the way is kept
If you have the sense to pray at the beginning of the meeting, you must do it; then the release of the spirit will be so prevailing
If you think that you should not pray because a hymn has not yet been called, you will simply kill yourself and the others
If anyone behaves or functions in the meetings in a way which is not according to pattern, they say it is wrong
They will start to sing hymns and call on the Lord while they are driving in the car on the way to the meetings
We are so slow, so dull, so sloppy, and so influenced by formal religion that we think that it might not be so nice
Those with a doctor's degree have exercised their minds for many years; therefore, they are so keen in their minds
By dealing with all our sins, the world, and our self and flesh, we will immediately see the release of our spirit
Without the release, the singing is not as good; but with the release, it is wonderful, for all bondages have been broken!
We must overcome all sinful things, all worldly things, all things in the flesh, and all things of the natural life
He utilizes the worldly things, the things of the flesh, and the things of the natural life to bind, to damage and to wreck our spirit
We must declare to the whole universe that we are released, not because we are so pure, but because we are cleansed by the blood
The principles of pray-reading are to pray-read the Word in a quick way, with short phrases, praying something new and fresh
Those of us who have pray-read the Word can all testify that this is the best way to practice the release of the spirit
We may be intelligent in reading scientific or philosophical books, but when we come to the Bible, we are blind
In 1 Corinthians 14:16, the Apostle Paul tells us to pray with clear words that others might say 'Amen' to our prayers
We say this because Christianity stresses teaching too much and neglects the feeding and nourishing of the spirit
We should not only have the thought of authority when we speak of government, because authority is not the only nor the first thing
In so many places, there is no father, no mother, no big brother, no big sister, and almost all the elderly ones have left
Should we say that since we have no father, mother, big brother and big sister, we must forget about the family and wander on the streets?
Many times, the youngest, who is only twelve, is the wisest, while the oldest, who is eighteen, is not so wise
Sometimes, of the four that came back, the wisest is a sister; none of the three brothers can compare with her
Those who should take the lead just cannot do it, but the sisters, who should not take the lead, are quite gifted and qualified
On one hand she must be faithful to the family, but on the other she must be willing to be covered by her brother
It is always there, and because of the standard of the church, it is evidently not good for one with such a background to take the lead
Perhaps he who has the standing is just like plain water: he is neither sweet nor salty; he cannot do anything
He must therefore in faithfulness to the Lord do whatever he can to support his brother and be one with his brother
The plain brother, then, must realize that though he has the standing, he is not capable of bearing the responsibility
If he must say something, he will not know what to say; therefore, he must come to these two brothers and pray with them
Everyone among us must be faithful to the Lord, and everyone must learn that we do need the government in the church
They feel that everybody can do anything they like according to the Holy Spirit; therefore, they do not need leaders
If we all have learned the lesson of grace, wherever we go, we will simply go to the church on the proper ground
If we have the grace and learn the lesson of life, someday the Lord will put the responsibility on our shoulders
Christ is the content of the church, but we must realize that this Christ who is the content of the church is life to us
All Christians recognize that Christ is in the church, but few realize that Christ in the church means that He is life to us
All the brothers and sisters think that it is unnecessary to pray for them; they think that they must pray for the black ones
Finally, they will ask him to correct and change his attitude-'Brother, you know that in the church we must have a life of love
After a certain amount of pray-reading and contacting the Lord, you may say something to him in a positive way
You are out of the world of good and evil, and in another world, another sphere, another realm, which can help him to realize Christ
You have to bring him out of the sphere of good and evil and into the sphere of Christ, which is the sphere of life
Whenever he comes to you, you should never speak of who is right or who is wrong, who is proud or who is humble
The church is the very means to minister Christ to all kinds of people that they may be transformed with Him as life
The regular way in Christianity is to show love to her and convince her that she is wrong by the teaching in Ephesians 5
If we want a solid church life with a group of believers built up in a solid way, we must minister Christ as life so that everyone will grow
We expect a quick change, but we must be patient and help people to grow, not in the way of teaching, but in the way of life
By His mercy and grace, we must help others to realize that they need Christ as life all the time in a practical and living way
Philadelphia, the church to whom the sixth epistle was written, means brotherly love, and this is the best of the seven churches
In the past nineteen years of experience in Formosa, those who thought they had a gift of teaching became troublemakers
We must drop the concept that teachings, gifts and other things can help much in the building up of the church
All the so-called churches built up by ministries and gifts are short lived; it is not long before they are divided
The branches of the Vine bear fruit by imparting the life of the Vine to others and making them a part of the Vine
Christianity today depends upon the giant preachers with huge Gospel campaigns, but this is not so in the Bible
In the Bible, especially in the Gospel of John, the real Gospel preaching is the fruit-bearing of every member
The normal daily life of the members of the church is simply to bear fruit; then there is the increase of the church
Those who criticize in this way have been criticizing others for years, yet they themselves have not brought in any new ones
The normal way is not to use our human effort; nor is it to depend upon a revival campaign with a giant preacher
Fruit-bearing is the outflow of life; so we must grow in life and also take the responsibility of fruit-bearing
The increase and fruit-bearing of the church can be greatly frustrated and limited by the disposition of the leading ones in the churches
We should expect to see one day in Los Angeles more than one hundred meeting halls, with a thousand brothers and sisters in every hall
If there is a vine with many branches, spontaneously fruit will be brought forth, and this will be the real increase of the tree
It is exactly similar to putting our trust in all the members, not in the teachings and ministries, to build up the church
Some of the leading ones do not like to have others share the responsibility; they like to have everything in their hands
The spreading of God's kingdom really does not only depend on the apostles, but also on the believers migrating from city to city
We must look to the Lord that some will be burdened to go, and all of us should be willing to be burdened to go
If we are here as a local expression of the Lord's Body without an increase locally and a spreading universally, we are wrong
We must be so living and burning all the time for a certain amount of increase locally and for a measure of spreading universally
We must spread the Lord's testimony to many cities in this country and Canada, as well as to Mexico, Central and South America and Europe
Before that time, many had been brought into Christianity, but very few were clear concerning the assurance of salvation
Christ died that we might be brought to an end and that He could be life to us; then we could live by His resurrection life
From the very beginning, the Lord showed us these three things: the assurance of salvation, Christ as life, and the church life
We simply did not have any burden to speak of anything but the assurance of salvation, Christ as life, and the church life
In the past few years, we have concentrated on two matters: Christ as life, and the church as the expression of Christ
The things prophesied by the Lord Jesus in Luke 21:20-24 were mostly fulfilled at the time of Titus, the prince of the Roman Empire in A
The last part of Luke 2124 says that Jerusalem will be trodden under the feet of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled
Just overnight, Jerusalem, which has been fully trodden by the Gentiles for nearly twenty centuries, was returned to the people of Israel
The earth has rejected Me under your evil leadership, but now there is a group of people who will not go along with you
As a seeker of Christ, we must realize that the world situation today is the real fulfillment of the Word of God
Not only the return of the city of Jerusalem, but even the talks in the United Nations are part of the fulfillment
If you ask the politicians and statesmen why there is a United Nations, they will tell you that it is for peace and safety
We must be transformed and built up in a local expression of His Body that we may be prepared as His Bride for His return
