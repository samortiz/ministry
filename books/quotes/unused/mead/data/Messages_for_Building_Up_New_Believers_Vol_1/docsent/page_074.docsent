   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Not Offering Prayers That Exceed</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our Individual Prayers</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another principle in the prayer meeting is to not offer prayers that go beyond our personal prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a good principle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The way you pray in the meeting should be governed by the way you pray at home by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, prayer in the meeting is a little different; it should not be exactly the same as your personal prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But in principle do not allow your public prayers to exceed your private prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The way you pray in the meeting should be almost the same as the way you pray in your private prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do not pray one way in your private prayer and another way in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Actually, it is difficult to have artificial private prayers, but many prayers in the meeting are artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you go to a prayer meeting and constantly use words that you do not use in your private prayers, your prayers are bound to be artificial.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As far as accomplishing anything is concerned, the prayer in the meeting is always more effective than private prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God answers the prayer of the church more readily than He answers individual prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But today we receive more answers to private prayers than assembly prayers because there are too many false and vain prayers in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Actually, there should be more answers to corporate prayers than answers to individual prayers; there should be not only more but very much more.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If God s children come together, and everyone prays in a simple, specific, genuine, and harmonious way, there will be more answers to our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE MEETING FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE GIFTS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gifts found in every local church are different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God gives certain localities the gift of prophecy, words of revelation and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes He adds speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In some localities God gives only the gifts of the teachers but not miraculous gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other localities He gives both miraculous gifts and the teaching of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot dictate what God should do in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the principle of meeting is always the same God wants all His children to exercise their gifts in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We cannot function according to what we do not have; we can only function according to the gifts that we do have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, a locality cannot insist on having a meeting for the exercise of the gifts; nor can it imitate other churches in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It can function only according to the gifts the brothers in that locality possess.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the kind of meeting spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should follow the Scripture in conducting this kind of meeting for the functioning of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The sisters should not open their mouths v. 34 , and the brothers should be restricted vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>32-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there is any prophesying, let there be only two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some may ask questions and seek mutual building up and enlightening from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In such meetings there should not be the speaking in tongues unless there is the interpretation of tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Tongues are for the building up of individuals before God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Speaking in tongues plus the interpretation of tongues equals prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there is only speaking in tongues without the interpretation of tongues, the mind will be unfruitful, and the church will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why Paul said, If there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church v. 28 . He did not forbid speaking in tongues, but he forbade any speaking in tongues that was without interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Simply put, in this kind of meeting, whether one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation, all things should be donefor building up.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to pay particular attention before God to remind all the gifted brothers who serve in the ministry of the word to not become passive in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers who are gifted in the ministry of the word often become spectators in this meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They become passive and allow others to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not everyone can speak in such meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only those who are gifted can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We disagree with one man speaking, but we also disagree with anyone speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is wrong to permit only one man to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is also wrong to permit just anyone to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Only the speaking of the gifted ones will render supply to the brothers and sisters; not everyone can do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only those who have the word can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who do not should keep quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Unfortunately, the gifted brothers who have the ministry often have an improper attitude towards such meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They think that every brother and sister can open their mouth in this meeting, and so they sit back.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Actually, this meeting is for every brother who is gifted and who has the ministry to stand up and speak.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How can we expect to have a good meeting if all those who are supposed to be the mouths do not speak, hoping instead that the hands, legs, and ears will speak?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In such a meeting, all the gifted brothers should bear the responsibility to seek before the Lord for something to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once they have the word, they should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such meetings do pose some difficulty for the new believers; they do not know whether they are gifted or not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They have little to do with the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They have just believed in the Lord, and there is little they can do.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How can they participate in this meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I hope the mature ones will not shut up the younger ones mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should give them an opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should tell them, We do not know whether or not you are a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not know whether God has given you the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>So in the beginning, please be simple as you are learning to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must give them an opportunity, but you should not give them too much opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You will bury their gift if you do not give them the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But if you give them too much opportunity, they will spoil the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let them open their mouths, but tell them to be brief and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If they are gifted, you must tell them, You can speak longer next time.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To certain ones you need to say, Your speaking is too long.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Please be shorter next time.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You must encourage the gifted ones to go on and somewhat restrict the ones who are not gifted.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this way the meeting will become strong without shutting the mouths of any brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>New believers should learn to be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>They must open their mouths more when they are being encouraged and open their mouths less when they are reminded to stop.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They should follow the leading of the more mature brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The responsible brothers in the church must not only perfect the more advanced ones but also constantly look for new gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How do you discover a gift?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The gifts are manifested in the meeting through the functioning of the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this meeting, open your eyes to those who have a mark of the Lord s operation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You have to learn of the condition of these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Encourage them if they should be encouraged, and restrict them if they should be restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>As a consequence, the new believers will not only be helped but also be able to help others in such a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>You will then guide the meeting onto the proper course.</S>
