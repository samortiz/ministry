<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Ointment Symbolizing the Completed God</H2><P>The completed, or consummated, God is symbolized by the ointment, which was compounded with four spices and olive oil (Exo. 30:22-25). This ointment is mentioned in 1 John 2:20 and 27. In these verses the word anointing, a gerund, is used to describe the moving of the ointment. When you apply cream to your face, you cause the cream to move. We may say that in Exodus 30 we have the "cream," the ointment, and in 1 John 2 we have the moving of the cream, the anointing. We have this anointing, the moving of the ointment, within us.</P><P>The ointment is not a thing but a person&#151;the completed God. The ointment within us is the processed, compounded, consummated Triune God, the God who has passed through the necessary processes in order to be completed. This is the greatest provision God has prepared for His redeemed people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Spirit</H2><P>In the Bible, the last title given to the Spirit of God is "the Spirit" (Rev. 22:17). The completed God is the Spirit. John 7:39b says, "The Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified." When Jesus was glorified, that is, when He entered into resurrection (Luke 24:26), the Triune God was consummated and completed to become the Spirit. The Spirit, therefore, is the processed, consummated, and completed Triune God.</P><P>Let us consider what the Spirit comprises. Within the Spirit is divinity, the divine nature. The Spirit also includes humanity, the human nature. This means that the Spirit includes the element of incarnation. How great a thing was the incarnation! God was conceived within a virgin's womb and stayed there for nine months. The divine conception was part of a marvelous process. This conception was followed by the Lord's birth and human living. For thirty years the Lord Jesus lived in the home of a carpenter. Then He came forth to minister for three and one-half years, passing through all kinds of sufferings. In His crucifixion He accomplished an all-inclusive death. Then He walked through death, came forth from death, and entered into resurrection. In resurrection He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), and this life-giving Spirit is now the Spirit&#151;the consummation of the processed Triune God. Now He is ready to be applied to us as the ointment. He is the Triune God, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the Spirit. Within Him are God, man, redemption, the impartation of life, and the power of resurrection. What a wonderful divine provision! Our God is now anointing us with this provision. He is anointing us with the compounded Spirit, the consummation and completion of the processed Triune God.</P><P>I can testify that when I am preparing myself to speak for the Lord, I usually pray, "Lord, fill me with Yourself as the essential Spirit and pour Yourself upon me as the economical Spirit. O Lord, in my speaking be one spirit with me so that You speak in my speaking." Whenever I pray like this, I am strengthened, confirmed, infused, and filled inwardly and outwardly with the consummated Triune God.</P>
