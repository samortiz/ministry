   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A SON GIVEN BY THE ETERNAL FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The child born of a human virgin is a son given by the Eternal Father Isa 9:6a; John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A. His Name to Be Called Wonderful Counselor,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Isaiah 9:6 says that this One's name is to be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus far, we have seen that this One is both Jesus and Immanuel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaiah 9:6 reveals four more items of what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some translations separate the words Wonderful and Counselor with a comma, indicating that these are two separate titles.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, because the other items in 9:6 are composed of a noun with a modifier, it is logical to say that "Wonderful" should modify "Counselor."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The prophecy in Isaiah 7:14 concerning Immanuel can be seen in its fulfillment in Matthew 1:20-23.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The prophecy in Isaiah 9:6 concerning Christ as the wonderful One can be seen in its fulfillment in John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaiah 9:6 says that "a child is born to us, a son is given to us."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 3:16 is based upon Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A son was given by a child being born.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the birth of that child, there was a gift given by God His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That child was both a man-child and a God-child, that is, a God-man child.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Eternal Father gave us a gift, and that gift was His Son, who became the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His Son, the gift given to us, is called the Wonderful Counselor.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is also the Mighty God and the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Gospel of John unveils the Son as well as the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Son and the Father are mentioned many times in this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It shows us that the Son and the Father are one John 10:30; 14:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is also the Prince of Peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This title is related to government.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Isaiah 9:6 says, "The government is upon His shoulders," and verse 7 says, "To the increase of His government and to His peace there is no end."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Luke 1 the angel Gabriel said to Mary that "He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of His kingdom there shall not be an end" v. 33 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This One was a child born of a human virgin and a son given by the Eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 1:14 says that He was the Word, the very God, who became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John 1:14 does not use the words born or given.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It says the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was the Word, and then He became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>His becoming flesh was His coming full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His becoming flesh was God's incarnation, in which He became God's embodiment Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God came as grace and reality for us to receive Him, gain Him, and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This God, who is grace as our portion, is also our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We had nothing real until we received the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we enjoy Him, He becomes our portion, and this portion is our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Word became flesh, He came as grace and reality.</S>
