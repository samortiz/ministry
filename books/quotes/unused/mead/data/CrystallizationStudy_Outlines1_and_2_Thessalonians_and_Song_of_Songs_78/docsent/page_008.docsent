   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Message Eight Our Heart to Be Established Blameless in Holiness Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 3:13; Prov 4:23 The heart is the conglomerate of man s inward parts, man s chief representative, his acting agent: Our heart is a composition of all the parts of our soul the mind, the emotion, and the will Matt 9:4; Heb 4:12; John 14:1; 16:22; Acts 11:23 plus one part of our spirit the conscience Heb 10:22; 1 John 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our heart with its condition before God is organically, intrinsically, and inseparably related to the condition of our spirit, soul, and body before God: The exercise of the spirit works only when our heart is active; if man s heart is indifferent, the spirit is imprisoned within and is unable to show forth its capability Matt 5:3, 8; Psa 78:8; Eph 3:16-17.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The soul is the person himself, but the heart is the person in action; the heart is the acting agent, the acting commissioner, of our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The activities and movements of our physical body depend on our physical heart; in like manner, our daily living, the way we act and behave, depends on what kind of psychological heart we have.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The heart is the entrance and exit of life, the switch of life; if the heart is not right, life in the spirit is hindered, and the law of life cannot work freely and without obstruction to reach every part of our being; though life has great power, this great power is controlled by our small heart Prov 4:23; Matt 12:33-37; cf.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because our heart is changeable, it needs to be renewed continually by the sanctifying Spirit so that our heart can be established, built up, in the state of being holy, the state of being separated unto God, occupied by God, possessed by God, and saturated with God Titus 3:5; Rom 6:19, 22.</S>
