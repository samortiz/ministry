   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRIUNE GOD REACHING US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When Christians are asked about the Holy Spirit, they often say that the Spirit is the third Person of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They point out that the Godhead includes three Persons: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Although it is true to say that the Holy Spirit is the third of the Godhead, this understanding is not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very important to see that the Father and the Son are fully realized in the Spirit as the third of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that we cannot separate the Holy Spirit from the Son or the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The three of the Godhead not only coexist, but They also coinhere.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, among the Father, Son, and Spirit there are both coexistence and coinherence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is triune; He is three-one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Coexistence means to exist together at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Coinherence is much more difficult to define or understand.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Applied to the Triune God, this term means that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit exist in one another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible reveals clearly that when the Son came, the Father came with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, when the Spirit comes, He comes with the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, when the Son came, the Father came with the Son not in an outward way, but inwardly, subjectively, within the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regarding the relationship between the Father and the Son and between the Son and the Spirit, the Gospel of John uses a particular Greek preposition, a preposition which can be translated from with 6:46; 16:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Son came not only from the Father, but even from with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He came from the Father and also with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicates that when the Son came, the Father came also.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Father came in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore the Lord could say, He who has seen Me has seen the Father John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He could also testify, I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me John 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, the Father and the Son are two; on the other hand, They are one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because the Father came not only with the Son but also in Him, the Son, the Lord Jesus, could say, The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works John 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, according to the Bible, if we have the Son, we have the Father also 1 John 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because the Father is with the Son and even in Him, we receive the Father when we receive the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, when the Spirit comes, He comes with both the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, to have the Spirit is to have the Son and the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Holy Spirit is the ultimate and consummate reaching of the Triune God to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not think that when the Holy Spirit reaches you, only He, the third of the Godhead, comes, and that the Father and the Son remain in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some Christians have such an understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Instead of believing that Christ is in us, they claim that Christ sent the Holy Spirit to function as His representative in us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This concept is altogether wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible does not speak of the Spirit representing the Son in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>On the contrary, according to the Scriptures, when the Holy Spirit comes, the Son comes with Him and in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Father also comes with the Son and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This means that when the Holy Spirit comes to us, the entire Triune God comes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the Bible, we may say that the Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How marvelous that the Holy Spirit is the consummate reaching of the Triune God to you and me!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>INDWELT BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As those who believe in Christ, we may have the full assurance that the Holy Spirit dwells within us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, concerning this there is much confusion among Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some insist that after a person has become a Christian, he must still pray to receive the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some go so far as to claim that speaking in tongues is the unique sign of receiving the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the Bible, when we believed in the Lord Jesus, called on His name, and received Him as our Savior, the Holy Spirit entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From that time onward, we have been indwelt by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not need to speak in tongues as a sign that we have received the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One definite indicator that we have received the Holy Spirit is that we have a sweet sense within when we call on God our Father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One day a young man asked Brother Nee about Romans 8:16, a verse which says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He wanted help to understand what it means to say that the Holy Spirit witnesses with our spirit in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since that young man was married, Brother Nee asked him if he sensed the same sweetness when he called his father-in-law Daddy as he did when he addressed his own father in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The young man testified that he did not have the same sense of sweetness in both cases.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brother Nee pointed out to him that he could call his own father Daddy in a sweet way because he had been born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brother Nee then asked him if he had a sense of sweetness within when he called God his Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The young man said with assurance that he did experience this sweetness.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Brother Nee replied, You are certainly saved.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The reason you sense this sweetness is that you have the Spirit within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You now have the spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The sweetness you experience when you call on God the Father is a sign that you have received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Whether or not we ever speak in tongues, we may have the assurance that we have received the Holy Spirit and are now children of God.</S>
