   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE ORGANIC PROCESSES IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EXPERIENCED BY THE MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; John 3:6b; 1 Pet 1:3; Eph 1:13; Rom 8:11; 1 Cor 12:13b; Rom 8:23a; Acts 13:52; 1 John 2:27; Exo 30:23-25; Rom 8:14-15</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In chapter three we saw the organic union of the divine Trinity in the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit works with all that the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We saw that the totality of what God has obtained and attained is the church in this age and the New Jerusalem in the coming age and for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Everything has been accomplished in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First Peter 1:3 says that we were regenerated through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead nearly two thousand years ago, we were regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were regenerated before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the Triune God s incarnation through His ascension, He has accomplished everything that He intended to accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He has obtained and attained what He desires.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now the consummation of this Triune and processed God, the very consummated, compound Spirit, comes to apply to us what God has already accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the work of the Spirit today.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this chapter we want to go on to see the organic processes in the Spirit experienced by the members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are still passing through the processes that are in the organic Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BAPTIZED INTO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AS THE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first item of the organic processes in the Spirit is our baptism into the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Baptism is a big battlefield in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some practice immersion and others practice sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some debate over whether a person should be baptized in hot water, cold water, salt water, fresh water, a lake, a sea, a pool, a river, or a baptistry.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some denominations feel that only baptism in their water is valid.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The technique of baptizing people has also been subject to debate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Others have argued over the name into which a person should be baptized the name of the Lord Jesus or the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To understand the truth concerning baptism, we have to take care of all the related verses in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament shows us the truth of both water baptism and Spirit baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Matthew 3:11 records John the Baptist saying that he baptized in water and that the Lord, as the One coming after him, would baptize in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Testament the Spirit is revealed in two aspects: the aspect of essence and the aspect of economy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit in this verse is both essential and economical.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The essential Spirit is for our life and living.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The economical Spirit is for our ministry and work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord puts us into the Spirit so that we can experience the Spirit both essentially and economically.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our practice of baptizing people must be according to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to tell the ones whom we are baptizing that we are putting them into the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must exercise our faith to baptize the repentant and believing sinners into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit according to the Lord s charge in Matthew 28:19.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit in Matthew 28:19 is both essential and economical.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because He is listed and ranked with the Son and the Father in this verse, the Spirit is being referred to in His entirety in both aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Before the Triune God was incarnated, He was working among men.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But in the Old Testament, God did not have humanity because He had not yet become flesh, and He had not passed through the processes of human living, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In John 11:25 the Lord told Martha that He was the resurrection and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before He was resurrected, He was already the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But He did not have the practical experience of entering into resurrection in His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the Old Testament, He was perfect in His divine virtues and attributes, but He was not complete in the sense that He had not passed through the necessary processes to be consummated as the all-inclusive Spirit for the fulfillment of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Triune God existed before incarnation, but He had not been consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For Him to be consummated in order to accomplish His plan, He needed to pick up human nature, pass through the trials, temptations, and tests of human living, go through an all-inclusive death, and enter into the practical experience of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His incarnation was the beginning of His consummating work until He was fully consummated in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In resurrection the Triune God was not only perfect but also consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why He came back in resurrection to charge His disciples to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By that time the consummation of the Triune God had been fully accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are baptized into the Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Triune God is referred to throughout the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even in Genesis 1:1 the divine Trinity is referred to because the Hebrew word for God is plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But it was not until the Lord Jesus resurrected from the dead that the title the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit was mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Resurrection was the consummation of all the processes that the Triune God had to go through.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In resurrection the Triune God was fully consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At the time of Matthew 28:19, the Triune God had the human nature, and He was qualified with the experience of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>With Him there was also a wonderful, excellent, lovable death.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Death in Adam is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But death with the resurrected Christ who is the embodiment of the Triune God is excellent, marvelous, and lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the time He charged the disciples to baptize others into the Triune God, He had also entered into His glorious resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When the Lord Jesus, the embodiment of the Triune God, was telling His disciples to go to disciple the nations, He was in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As the consummation of the Triune God, He was telling His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We baptize people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Into in Matthew 28:19 indicates a kind of organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into spiritual and mystical union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We human beings can be put into God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We were once outside of God, but our baptism brought us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When we go to baptize people, we go to put them into God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Baptism produces an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are organically united with the Father, the Son, and the Spirit because we have been baptized into the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Praise the Lord for such an excellent, marvelous, wonderful organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is the one name for the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The name indicates the person.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To baptize people into such a name is to baptize them into the person of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the reaching of God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Trinity reaches us as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When the Triune God is in the heavens, He is the Father, the source.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When He came to the earth, He was the Son, the course.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When He comes into us, He is the Spirit, the reaching One.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The Spirit is the realization of the Son, who is the embodiment of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What has reached us is the consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Baptism brings us into an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This should strengthen our assurance in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>After we preach the gospel to someone and they receive the Lord through prayer and calling on His name, we should immediately put them into the very person of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have seen that God was incarnated to be a man and that this God-man walked on this earth, living a human life for over thirty years.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He went to the cross and died an all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then He came out of death and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He put all of His believers into the consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>When and where did He do this?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>When is a matter of time, and where is a matter of space.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Thoughts of time and space are human.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>But in the divine thought there is no time or space; everything is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>A circle may be used to represent eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>At a certain place on the circle we may place a cross to signify the crucifixion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>It is difficult to say what events came before the cross and what transpired after the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>It depends on which direction on the circle that one says is before or after the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Revelation 13:8 says that Christ as the Lamb was slain from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>According to this verse, the crucifixion was accomplished from the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>God s thought is in the eternal realm outside the realm of time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God only cares for the fact, not for time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Scriptures reveal that we were baptized in the Spirit before we were born.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The resurrected and ascended Christ as the Head of the church has already baptized all His believing members into the consummated God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He did this in two steps.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The first step was on the day of Pentecost, when the Jewish believers were baptized in the Holy Spirit Acts 1:5; 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The second step was in the house of Cornelius, when the Gentile believers were baptized in the Spirit 10:44-47; 11:15-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In these two steps all genuine believers in Christ have been baptized in the Holy Spirit into one Body once for all universally 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Based upon this, the disciples baptized the new converts not only visibly into water but also invisibly into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>When the Lord Jesus charged the disciples to baptize the nations into the Triune God, He was referring to both water baptism and Spirit baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If we baptize people into water without the Spirit, that is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Water baptism and Spirit baptism should be absolutely one.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Since the baptism in the Holy Spirit has already been accomplished, some may wonder why we need to practice baptism along with our preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>To be baptized is to accept the fact that has already been accomplished by the doing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The baptizing ones and the baptized ones are saying amen to the fact that the believers have been put into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>To say amen to this fact is to receive it experientially as one of the bequests of the New Testament.</S>
