   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SHOWN BY THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Jerusalem in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two unveils the Triune God to us in an ultimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All the features of the holy city that John describes are wonderful signs showing us the Triune God and His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We shall look at just two of those features.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. The Triune God as Our Entrance</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Revelation 21:12 and 13 tell us that this city has "a great and high wall; having twelve gates..on the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The three gates on each side signify that the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit works together to bring people into the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is indicated by the three parables in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We saw in Lesson Eight that in order for a sinner to be brought to the Father's house, there is the need of the Son, the Shepherd, to bring back the lost sheep; there is the need of the Spirit to enlighten people's hearts that they may repent; and there is the need of the Father to receive the returned and repentant prodigal son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence the Triune God is the entrance to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Each of the four sides of the city has three gates.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The gates on any one side are exactly the same as the gates on the other three sides.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This indicates that the Triune God is available to people in all four corners of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether you come from the east, north, south or west, there is an entrance into the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We will see in the next lesson that the New Jerusalem is not a physical city but rather the Triune God mingled with His people.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What an entrance this city has!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. The Triune God as Our Existence</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verse 1 of chapter twenty-two says, "And he showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we see the Triune God in full.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is God, the Lamb, and the river, which represents the Spirit John 7:38-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Notice that there are not two thrones one for God and one for the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There is only one throne.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then how do They sit?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Are They side by side or are They one on top of another?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>By now you should know that God is in the Lamb and the Lamb is in God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They coinhere one another.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>And out of this throne, God the Spirit is flowing out as a river.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the Spirit reaches you, you have both the Father and the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This scene shows us the Triune God for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, God the Father is the Creator Eph 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He created all things, including you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If He did not create us, we would not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So we must thank Him for being the creating God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, the Son as the Lamb is our Redeemer John 1:29; Eph 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He shed His blood for our sins that we might be redeemed back to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Without His redemption we would be under God's condemnation forever in the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>So we must praise Him, our redeeming Lamb!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Finally, the Spirit, shown by the river of life, is our Regenerator John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit regenerated us so that we are born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then He continually supplies us so that we may grow in God and express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is for our existence as children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should greatly appreciate such a three-one God for our threefold existence; He is our Creator, Redeemer, and Regenerator.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Questions Pray-read Revelation 22:1-2 with your companions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Explain how Revelation 22:1-2 reveals the Triune God.</S>
