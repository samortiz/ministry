The Young Lion Signifying Christ<br />in His Freshness and Strength<br />Overcoming All the Enemies</h2><p>Verse 9 says, &ldquo;Judah is a young lion; / From the prey, my son, you have gone up.&rdquo; The young lion signifies Christ in His freshness and strength overcoming all the enemies. The lion stayed on the mountain, but he came down from the mountain to capture his prey as food. After he seized his prey, he went back to the mountain to enjoy it. When Christ was on earth and was crucified on the cross, He was a young lion seizing the prey. Ephesians 4:8 says, &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive.&rdquo; <em>Those taken captive</em> refers to the redeemed saints, who were taken captive by Satan before being saved by Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan&rsquo;s captivity and took them to Himself. This indicates that He conquered and overcame Satan, who had captured them by sin and death. As the young lion, He has overcome all His enemies.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Couching Lion<br />Signifying Christ in His Skillfulness<br />Resting in the Enjoyment of the Fruit<br />of His Victory</h2><p>Verse 9 goes on to say, &ldquo;He couches, he stretches out like a lion.&rdquo; The couching lion signifies Christ in His skillfulness resting in the enjoyment of the fruit of His victory. The young lion in his freshness is for fighting and for gaining the victory. The couching lion is skillful, indicating that he has gained the victory and devoured the prey and that he is now resting in satisfaction. Christ is now the One enjoying His rest in the heavens. After gaining the victory and enjoying the prey, He is satisfied. This rest and satisfaction is the issue of Christ&rsquo;s victory.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Lioness Signifying Christ<br />in His Strong Producing</h2><p>Verse 9 also says that Judah was like a lioness. The lioness signifies that Christ in His strong producing has produced many overcomers. Hence, Christ is not only the fighting lion and the resting lion but also the producing lioness. We are lion cubs produced by Him, and the church is lion country. Toward men we are lambs following the Lamb; but toward Satan we are lion cubs. We are overcomers produced by the overcoming Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Judah&rsquo;s Hand Being<br />on the Neck of the Enemies Indicating<br />that He Has the Power<br />to Capture the Enemies</h2><p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;Your hand will be on the neck of your enemies.&rdquo; Judah&rsquo;s hand being on the neck of the enemies indicates that he has the power to capture the enemies, making them powerless to resist and thus gaining the final victory over them. Christ as the Lion of the tribe of Judah is the ultimate Overcomer.</p><h2 class="head2">E. No One Daring to Rouse Judah Up<br />Indicating That His Terrifying Power<br />Subdues Everything</h2><p>The last part of verse 9 says, &ldquo;Who will rouse him up?&rdquo; Some versions say, &ldquo;Who dares to rouse him?&rdquo; No one daring to rouse him up indicates that his terrifying power subdues everything. After His death and resurrection Christ has received all authority in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18). Furthermore, God has exalted Him to the highest place (Phil. 2:9), far above all rule and authority and power and lordship (Eph. 1:21). Hence, all things are subjected under His feet (v. 22), subdued under His terrifying power.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 3, Vol. 1 &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
