   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>e. Salvation as the Helmet</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the first part of Ephesians 6:17 Paul goes on to say, Receive the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is for covering our mind against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Such a helmet, such a covering, is God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan injects threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s salvation is the covering that we take up against all these.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Satan s darts come to us through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, just as our conscience needs the breastplate of righteousness and our will needs the shield of faith, so our mind needs the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and then salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have truth in our living, we will have righteousness as our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Righteousness issues in peace, and peace gives us the ground to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then faith brings in salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>f.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Spirit, the Word of God, as the Sword</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul also speaks of the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Among the six items of God s armor, the sword of the Spirit is the only one for attacking the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the sword we cut the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, we do not take up the sword first.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Rather, we must first put on the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes, and then take up the shield of faith and the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are entirely protected and have salvation as our portion, we may receive the sword of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The antecedent of the word which in verse 17 is Spirit, not sword.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the Spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both the Spirit and the word are Christ 2 Cor 3:17; Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ as the Spirit and the word furnishes us with a sword as an offensive weapon to defeat and slay the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Word is the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if this Word is only the printed letters, it is neither the Spirit nor the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Greek word for word in Ephesians 6:17 is rhema, the instant word spoken at any moment by the Spirit in any situation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the logos, the constant word in the Bible, becomes the rhema, the instant word, this rhema will be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This rhema, which becomes the Spirit, is the sword that cuts the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, we may read a particular verse again and again, only to have it remain the logos, a word in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Such a word cannot kill anything, but one day the Spirit speaks this verse to us, and it becomes the rhema to us, the present, instant, living speaking of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time this rhema becomes the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For this reason, in John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here also the Greek text for words is rhema.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The instant, present word is the Spirit; this kind of word is the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, the sword, the Spirit, and the word are one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our Christian experience the Word and the Spirit should always be one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without taking the Word, we cannot have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our experience we receive the Spirit mostly through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As we contact the Word in a living way, it becomes the Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, we should not take the Bible without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must have both the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ is both the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is not the Spirit without being the Word nor the Word without being the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because He is both the Word and the Spirit, He created us with a mind to understand and a spirit to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to the Bible, we should exercise both our mind and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We exercise our mind by reading and our spirit by praying.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since we need both to read and to pray, we should pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Through pray-reading our spirit becomes strong and ready to kill the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We should not only exercise our spirit to receive the Spirit but also exercise our mind to consider the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more our spirit is strengthened by pray-reading the Word, the more eager we become to use the sword of the Spirit to slay the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In our speaking we should have a sword with which to cut the enemy to pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>With the whole armor of God we have truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Finally, we have the rhema, the Spirit, the sword; this is our offensive weapon for attacking the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we have the whole armor of God, including the sword, we are not only protected but also prepared to wrestle against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By having truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation, we are equipped, qualified, strengthened, and empowered to use the sword in spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the enemy is subject to the cutting of our sword, and he is slaughtered by us.</S>
