The priests ate not man's food but God's food, food which is most holy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) To Be Eaten by Every Male<br>of the Priests' Houses in a Most Holy Place</H2><P>The holy portions were eaten by every male (the stronger ones) of the priests' houses in a most holy place (v. 10). The most holy place here signifies the church, the Body of Christ. According to the typology in Numbers 18, apart from this most holy place, we cannot enjoy Christ very much. Of course, we can enjoy Christ at the altar, but this enjoyment is superficial. In order to enjoy that part of Christ which God enjoys, we need to be in a most holy place. We admit that Christ is everywhere and that we can enjoy Him everywhere. Nevertheless, some parts of Christ we cannot enjoy unless our standing and position are right. Our standing must be in the proper church life, in the organic Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Heave Offering<br>and the Wave Offering of the Sons of Israel</H2><P>"This also is yours, the heave offering of their gift, all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel; I have given them to you, and to your sons and daughters with you, as a perpetual due" (v. 11a). This verse speaks of two particular portions&#151;the heave offering (the ascended Christ) and the wave offering (the resurrected Christ). To heave is to lift up. In typology, the heave offering refers to Christ's being lifted up, to Christ's ascension.</P><P>In the New Testament we have a revelation of Christ from eternity past to eternity future. In eternity past Christ was the Word (John 1:1). Then, in time, He was incarnated. Thus we have Christ in His incarnation. He lived on earth in His humanity and was crucified. Then He resurrected and ascended, becoming the Christ in resurrection and ascension. He will come again and will reign in the millennial kingdom. Finally, in eternity future, He will be in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. Thus, we have Christ in nine great aspects: as the Word, in His incarnation, in His human living, in His crucifixion, in His resurrection, in His ascension, in His second coming, in the millennium, and in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth. Whereas this is revealed clearly in the New Testament, in the Old Testament we have Christ in typology, and the details of Christ revealed there are endless.</P><P>Concerning the enjoyment of Christ in a stronger way, there is a cycle. If we would enjoy Christ in this way, we need to be stronger. The stronger we are, the more strongly will we enjoy Christ. Then the more we enjoy Christ in a stronger way, the stronger we will be.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_101.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_103.html">Next</a> </body></html>
