   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FATHER'S PLAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Firstly, we have the Father's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the King James Version, Ephesians 3:11 speaks of "the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word purpose is an archaic term for the modern word plan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we speak of God's plan we are referring to God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In eternity past God made a plan, a plan to have the church for Christ Eph 3:8-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God's plan is not just to have a group of sinners, nor to have a group of redeemed ones.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such a concept is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God's plan is to have a bride for His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have heard time and time again that Christ came to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But have you ever heard a message telling you that Christ came to have the bride?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 3:29 says, "He who has the bride is the bridegroom."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus told His disciples that He was the Bridegroom Matt 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He came not only to save sinners but to have the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Are we still sinners?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>No, we are the bride!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Praise the Lord that we are no longer sinners we are the bride!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Should we still come to God confessing our sins in a begging way?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No, we must come to Him joyfully, saying, "Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am so happy that I am no longer a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I'm a part of the bride!"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ came not merely to be our Savior and Redeemer; He also came to be the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God did not plan to save a group of poor sinners and bring them all into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God planned to take a part of the human race and make them the counterpart of His dear Son.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, in the new heaven and the new earth, we shall not have a group of pitiful sinners; we shall have the bride, the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have seen, God the Father planned to take a bride for His Son out of the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Abraham, a type of the Father, charged his servant, a type of the Holy Spirit, not to take a wife for his son from the daughters of the Canaanites but from Abraham's kindred 24:4, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In typology, this indicates that the counterpart of Christ must come from Christ's race, not from the angels nor from any other creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since Christ was incarnated as a man, humanity has become His race.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do not always think of humanity as being so poor.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Humanity is not poor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because humanity is the race of Christ, it is dear and precious to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only out of humanity can God obtain the counterpart for His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, we all must be proud of being a part of humanity and must say, "Praise the Lord that I am a man!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thank Him that I was not created as a part of the angelic race but as part of the human race."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Genesis 2 we see that God brought the living creatures to Adam to be named by him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Adam said, "This is a dog, and this is a cat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a monkey, and this is a donkey."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As he looked at all those creatures, he did not find his counterpart among them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, took one of his ribs, and built it into a woman as his counterpart 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, Adam and Eve were of the same race.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This indicates that Christ's counterpart must come from His race, the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all have been created as the human race, and as a part of the human race we all have been reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only the human race is qualified to be the counterpart of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE SPIRIT'S ERRAND</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While the father had a plan, the servant received a commission, an errand v. 33 . Abraham commissioned him to go to his race and take a wife for his son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This signifies that God the Father has commissioned God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The New Testament reveals such a divine commission.</S>
