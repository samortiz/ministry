   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TAKING CARE OF OUR CONSCIENCE A. A Good Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to be able to exercise our spirit it is vital to take care of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The conscience is the leading part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If our conscience is wrong, we can never have a proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Moreover, we can never even exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In fact, if our conscience is wrong, our spirit is dead!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, before we can properly exercise our spirit, we must first have a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you become contaminated by looking at certain kinds of pictures, your spirit will be defiled, contaminated, and deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result, you will not be able to pray unless you first ask the Lord to cleanse you from all defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I offer this as an illustration of our need to cooperate with the sanctifying Triune God to have our spirit preserved from deadness and contamination.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>B. The Need of the Cleansing Blood</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, whenever we exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, we need the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we do not know how to apply the blood, we really do not know how to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every time we exercise our spirit, we will sense that we need the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The cleansing blood is a must; it is absolutely vital and necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As soon as we exercise our spirit to contact the Lord, who is righteous and holy, we will sense the need of the blood to cleanse our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is in the glory, but we are sinful, evil, dirty, worldly and carnal, falling short of His glory!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, the blood must fill the gap between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must learn to apply the blood constantly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>EXERCISING BY PRAYING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to start to exercise our spirit by praying, because to pray, in principle, is something in the spirit Eph 6:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are going to exercise your eyes, you have to see.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you are going to exercise your feet, you have to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more you walk, the more you exercise your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In like manner, the best way for you to exercise your spirit is to learn to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, in your experience it may not seem so easy to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One reason why we cannot pray is that our spirit has not been used for a long, long time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is out of function, because it has not been exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Once a doctor told me that if we covered our eyes for three months, we would not be able to see.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even though we open our eyes, our sight will be lost, because we have not used our eyes for quite a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we do not use them, our eyes will fail to function.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, many brothers and sisters simply fail to use their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are constantly using their mind, emotion, will, or their physical body, but not their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the spirit fails to function and is consequently lost.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The unique way to exercise our spirit is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As we exercise our spirit in prayer, our aim should be to contact the Lord, not first to pray for certain people or things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Simply contact the Lord and allow Him to burden you to pray for certain ones.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not go to the Lord with your mind filled with things to pray for.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you try to contact the Lord in this way, you will close your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should come to the Lord with a spirit fully open, worshipping Him, praising Him, and thanking Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then we shall know what to pray for, and we shall have much to utter to the Lord in prayer.</S>
