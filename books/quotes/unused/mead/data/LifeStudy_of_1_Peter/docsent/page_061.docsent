   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LOVING THE BROTHERHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 17 says, Honor all men.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Love the brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Honor the king.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why does Peter say love the brotherhood instead of love the brothers ?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What does the term brotherhood mean here?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The brotherhood is the aggregate of the brothers, the family of the brothers, the brothers in the feeling of brotherliness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>An aggregate is a totality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>By using the word brotherhood Peter indicates that we should not merely love the brothers separately, one by one, or individualistically.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, we should love the totality of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that we should love the universal family of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As believers in Christ, we are not only a community; we are also a family.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A family is much more intimate than a community is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because we are in a family, we refer to one another as brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we were not of the same family, how could we be brothers to one another?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No matter what our skin color may be black, white, yellow, brown, or red we all are brothers in God s family.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hallelujah for this worldwide, universal family!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This family has been in existence for nearly two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word brotherhood in verse 17 refers to this family.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should love the brothers in God s family in the feeling of brotherliness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is to love the brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, few Christians today have the sense that in loving the brothers they are loving the brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that today s Christians do not have the sense of the corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Nevertheless, the church is altogether a corporate matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 9 we see that the church is a race, a priesthood, a nation, and a people for God s possession.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Now in verse 17 we see that the church is a brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The priesthood is for the service of God, and the brotherhood is for loving the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need to love the brothers in their totality; that is, we need to love the brothers in a corporate sense.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose twelve people come together from twelve different families.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although they may love one another, this is not the love in the category of a -hood, as love in a brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if twelve people are in the same family, born of the same parents, their love for one another will be a love in a -hood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They will love one another, but this love for each member of the family will be in a -hood.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their love is different from those from separate families who love others but not with a love in a -hood.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In such a case, they may love certain ones more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But those born of the same parents love everyone in the family and care for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is an illustration of loving the brotherhood, of loving the totality of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the church we love not merely the individual brothers; we love the totality, the -hood, of the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A WORD TO HOUSEHOLD SERVANTS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 18 Peter goes on to say, The household servants, subject yourselves in all fear to your masters, not only to the good and forbearing, but also to the crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even though certain masters may be crooked, the believers who are household servants should be subject to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This also is an aspect of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 18 Peter charges the household servants to be subject to their masters in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a holy fear, as in Philippians 2:12.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a healthy, serious caution for us to behave in a holy way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a fear is mentioned a number of times in this book because its teaching concerns the government of God.</S>
