<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p><em>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures</em> was originally published in Chinese as a six-volume set containing sixty topics of basic truths in the Bible. The topics and verses were selected and arranged by Witness Lee, and these books were greatly used by the Lord in the early spread of the local churches throughout the Far East. Volume 1 contains topics through 16. Future volumes in English will complete the series. These messages have been translated from the Chinese.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PREFACE TO THE CHINESE EDITION</h2>
<p>In order for the children of God, especially new believers, to receive a greater supply of the Word, we, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, wish to present some crucial truths in the Holy Scriptures so that the children of God may receive a foundation in the Word of God. These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo. Later, in the autumn of 1949, Brother Lee studied them again with the brothers and sisters in Taipei and added eighteen topics for a total of sixty topics in all. Chapters 1 through 16 cover the condition of a sinner to the time of knowing his salvation. Chapters 17 through 60 examine various matters a believer should know and pursue after his salvation, with chapters 17 through 33 specifically covering ten matters a believer should practice after his salvation. The purpose of these crucial truths is to make the matters of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation clear to those who lack an understanding of their salvation. Furthermore, they lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation. The purpose is specific, but the messages are diverse. The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God. We look to the Lord to inspire every brother and sister to read and study these notes carefully. We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible.</p>

<h1 class="title">THE CONDITION OF MAN&mdash;<br />
THE NEED OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the condition of man. Man&rsquo;s condition shows that he needs salvation. Hence, we must use the Bible to show man his condition so that he may realize his need for God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p>There are at least three aspects of the condition of fallen man prior to salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S CONDITION BEFORE GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All have sinned&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:23, see also vv. 10-12; 5:12).</p>
<p>The first aspect of man&rsquo;s condition before God is that he has sinned and is sinful. Man&rsquo;s sinfulness before God is twofold; it is both positional and experiential. Although a man may not have committed a sin, he is positionally sinful before God because he is a descendant of Adam. Adam was appointed by God to be the head of the human race, and as such, he represents the entire human race. When Adam sinned as head and representative of the human race, all the men represented by him also sinned. When the first man Adam sinned, all of his descendants were placed in a sinful position before God.</p>
<p>Since Adam is the father of the human race, all men are born of him. When Adam sinned, he not only represented all mankind but also included the entire human race. Adam&rsquo;s descendants were in him, even though none of them were born yet. When Adam sinned, his descendants sinned with him and in him. Adam&rsquo;s act of sin caused his descendants to sin in him. Man is sinful at birth; there is no need for him to sin, for he is sinful already.</p>
<p>Positionally, man is sinful before God. Experientially, man is also sinful before God. No one can say that he has never sinned or that he has clean hands, an undefiled heart, and no experience of sin. Everyone has experienced lying, stealing, filthy thoughts, or improper behavior. Man&rsquo;s position of sin produces his experience of sin. Man&rsquo;s experience of sin proves his position of sin. Both positionally and experientially, man is sinful.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Fall under the judgment of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Condemned already&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:19; John 3:18; see also Rom. 5:18).</p>
<p>Because man has sinned, he is under the judgment of God. God is righteous, and He is the One who establishes the law. According to His righteousness and His law, He must judge sinful man. God&rsquo;s righteousness and God&rsquo;s law place man under God&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>Man is under not only God&rsquo;s judgment but also His condemnation. Whether or not he is aware of it, man has been judged and is condemned before God. There is no need to wait for God&rsquo;s judgment in the future; man has already received the verdict that he is guilty of sin and is condemned before God. When God condemned Adam because of his sin, God also condemned the entire human race in Adam through his one offense. Today every human being is born a condemned sinner.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The wrath of God abides upon him&rdquo;; &ldquo;Children of wrath&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:36; Eph. 2:3).</p>
<p>Because men have sinned and transgressed against God&rsquo;s righteousness, they not only are condemned under God&rsquo;s judgment, but as children of wrath under God&rsquo;s wrath, men daily evoke His wrath. God&rsquo;s wrath is like thunder; it is ready to explode upon mankind. God withholds His wrath in order to give men the opportunity to repent and be saved. God&rsquo;s wrath will surely break forth on those who do not repent.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;It is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:27).</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s law, those who sin must die. Man sinned; therefore, his portion according to God&rsquo;s law (the portion reserved for man) is death. Death is set before the unrepentant sinner. If he refuses to repent, he will receive only death under God&rsquo;s wrath. When death comes to a man, God&rsquo;s wrath explodes upon him.</p>
<p>Death is not the end. After a man dies, he still faces judgment. Although he is already condemned, he will still face another judgment. In this future judgment, the condemnation under which God has placed man will be executed. Although God condemns man&rsquo;s sin according to His righteousness, He has not yet executed this condemnation because of His love. God desires man to repent; therefore, He waits and gives man opportunity to repent. If a man refuses to repent to the very end, he will enter into death and face God&rsquo;s final judgment. In His judgment God will execute the sentence that He has pronounced upon man.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Perish&rdquo;; &ldquo;Cast into the lake of fire&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16; Rev. 20:15; see also 21:8).</p>
<p>After an unrepentant man passes through God&rsquo;s final judgment, he will perish; that is, he will be thrown into the lake of fire to suffer eternally. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Mark 9:48, in the lake of fire &ldquo;their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.&rdquo; How painful and terrible to be eaten by worms and burned by fire!</p>
<p>This is man&rsquo;s condition before God.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S CONDITION IN HIMSELF</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Brought forth in iniquity&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 51:5).</p>
<p>Man is brought forth in iniquity and conceived in sin. Every human being is born as a sinner with a corrupt nature. Men sin because their nature is corrupt by birth. They do not need to learn how to sin because they are born with the innate ability to sin. A man does not learn how to sin from his environment; sin is the result of inward growth. The seed of sin is in him at birth; eventually, sin grows out from within.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The imagination of man&rsquo;s heart is evil from his youth&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 8:21).</p>
<p>Since man is born in sin, the imagination of his heart is evil from his youth. It is not necessary to be old, cunning, and deceitful in order to have an evil imagination. The imagination of man&rsquo;s heart is evil when he is still young and &ldquo;innocent.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 17:9).</p>
<p>From his youth man&rsquo;s heart not only has an evil imagination but is also deceitful above all things and is incurable. Nothing in creation compares with the wickedness of man&rsquo;s heart. The heart of man is most deceitful and is incurable. It is not just slightly wicked; it is entirely wicked&mdash;altogether incurable. Moreover, the evil of the heart spreads from within. Although there may be no appearance of wickedness outwardly, the heart is corrupt within. This corruption is eventually manifested.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;In my flesh, nothing good dwells&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:18).</p>
<p>Consider man&rsquo;s condition in himself. Nothing good dwells in his flesh. Since man was brought forth in iniquity and has an utterly deceitful and incurable heart, how can there be anything good in his flesh? No one can say, &ldquo;I will do good,&rdquo; and then does it. Is it not true with man that &ldquo;to will is present...but to work out the good is not&rdquo; (v. 18)? Since nothing good dwells in the flesh, a man cannot work out the good that he wills to do.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Filled with all unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:29-31; see also Mark 7:20-23).</p>
<p>In addition to the fact that nothing good dwells in man&rsquo;s flesh, his heart is filled with unrighteousness and sin. The seed of sin is in man and may spring forth at any time. Unrighteousness, lawlessness, sin, and filthiness do not originate outside of man but grow from within. No one is absolutely upright and clean, and no one is able to withstand God&rsquo;s shining and examination of his inward parts.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Enemies&rdquo; of God; &ldquo;Sons of disobedience&rdquo;; &ldquo;Not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be...cannot please God&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:21; Eph. 2:2; Rom. 8:7-8).</p>
<p>Man is evil and corrupt; thus, the human nature is opposed to the nature of God. God loves righteousness; man loves sin. God desires holiness; man desires filthiness. Therefore, man is an enemy of God and a son of disobedience. Since man is God&rsquo;s enemy, he is not subject to the law of God and does not desire to please God. Even if he desires to do so, it is impossible for man to obey God&rsquo;s law or to please God, because man is thoroughly corrupt and has no ability to keep God&rsquo;s law.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Not...holding God in their full knowledge&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:28).</p>
<p>Since man commits sin and is an enemy of God, he does not hold God in his knowledge. Sin makes man numb; it causes man to lose his sense of God. The first result of man&rsquo;s sin is that he no longer holds God in his knowledge. Men are not only sinful, but they also do not hold God in their knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Lost&rdquo;; &ldquo;Like sheep have gone astray&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 19:10; Isa. 53:6).</p>
<p>Since man sins and does not hold God in his knowledge, he is lost, like a sheep that has gone astray. Man was created for God; he belongs to God, and God is his Master. However, because man sinned and forsook God, he is lost and lordless. Men today are like sheep that have no master or shepherd, not knowing to whom they belong.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Dead in your offenses and sins&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:1, see also v. 5; Col. 2:13; Luke 9:60; 15:24; John 5:24).</p>
<p>Man is not only sinful and lost but also dead in offenses and sins. Since man is dead in offenses and sins, he is powerless to do good or to be righteous. No one can do good or be righteous. Who does not feel powerless in trying to do good and to be righteous? With regard to goodness and righteousness, man is weak and powerless to the uttermost. He is as weak as someone who is dead.</p>
<p>Because man is deadened within, he is powerless to do good and unable to sense the shame of sin. Man is powerless with regard to righteousness and insensitive to sin. Death makes man powerless and insensitive. Hence, man is powerless and has no feeling within. People today are powerless with regard to righteousness, and they have no sense of shame or remorse with regard to sin.</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s being without feeling regarding sin may be likened to a corpse that has no feeling while lying in the garbage. Man&rsquo;s insensitivity to sin is the result of being dead within; this insensitivity proves that man is dead within. Because he is inwardly dead and without feeling, man does many disgraceful things without feeling shame; he commits many deplorable deeds and is not grieved. When people watch sensual movies, they have no sense of shame but rather consider them quite pleasant. When people use filthy language, they are not ashamed but rather feel proud. It is indecent and shameful for a man to embrace a woman in a dance, yet people believe that it is noble and honorable. These examples prove that man is dead within. When man engages in sin, he is like a walking corpse.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;A slave of sin&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:34).</p>
<p>Man has been sold to sin as a slave; man is a slave of sin and is not his own master. Man is dominated and manipulated by sin to do many things against his will. Although people desire freedom, no one is truly free; everyone is controlled and bound by sin. No one sins of his own accord; neither is anyone free from sin whenever he chooses to be. All the struggles of man against sin end in vain.</p>
<p>Originally, man belonged to God, but now he belongs to sin; originally, God was man&rsquo;s Lord, but now sin is his lord. Sin has authority over man, making man its slave. Sin rules over man, causing man to commit sins and evil against his will.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Having no hope&rdquo; today</strong> (Eph. 2:12).</p>
<p>Men living on the earth today have no hope. They have no goal. Man is indeed empty and pitiful.</p>
<p>Day by day man labors and runs in vain. Although man seeks enjoyment and pleasure, he is actually pursuing shadows and chasing after the wind. Man is empty and has no hope because he lost God and is without God.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Die in...sins&rdquo; in the future</strong> (John 8:24).</p>
<p>Since man has no hope, he can expect only to die in his sins and to descend into Hades in sorrow. The final result of man&rsquo;s sin is his full transfer into death. Since man lives in his sins for his entire life, he will die in his sins and enter into eternal perdition.</p>
<p>This is man&rsquo;s condition in himself.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S CONDITION BEFORE SATAN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The children of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:10, see also v. 8; John 8:44).</p>
<p>Man is not only sinful and corrupt but is also of the devil. Man is of the devil because the devil&rsquo;s life is within him. Men are children of the devil; the devil is their father. A child has the life of his father. As children of the devil, men have the devil&rsquo;s life and nature within their being. The element of the devil is within man. Thus, man somewhat resembles the devil in the way he lives. Man lies, sins, and lusts in a manner similar to the devil because the lying, sinning, and lusting life and nature within man are of the devil. There is a life relationship and a union in nature between man and the devil.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;According to the ruler of the authority of the air&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2).</p>
<p>The ruler of the authority of the air is Satan. <em>The authorityof the air</em> refers to the messengers of Satan. Satan rules through his messengers in the air over the darkness of this world in order to subject men to himself (6:12). In order to subject men to himself, Satan is not only the ruler of the authority of the air but also &ldquo;the spirit which is now operating&rdquo; in the hearts of men (2:2). By operating in their hearts, Satan causes men to be subject to him; thus, they become sons of disobedience and oppose God. The evil that man does in opposition to God is the fruit of Satan&rsquo;s operation in his heart. Not one person is completely independent and free from Satan&rsquo;s influence. Man does not commit sinful, filthy, lustful, and dishonorable acts on his own; he is moved to do so. Man&rsquo;s actions are not entirely under his control; he acts according to &ldquo;the spirit which is now operating&rdquo; in his heart, which is Satan himself. The fact that man walks &ldquo;according to the age of this world&rdquo; and conducts himself in the lusts of the flesh, &ldquo;doing the desires of the flesh and of the thoughts&rdquo; (vv. 2-3), proves that he is subject to Satan. Therefore, not only are Satan&rsquo;s life and nature within man, but also Satan himself, the evil spirit, is within man.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The god of this age has blinded the thoughts of the unbelievers&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>Satan operates in man&rsquo;s heart to make him do things against God; he also blinds man&rsquo;s thoughts so that he does not know God and cannot see the light of the Lord&rsquo;s gospel. Men believe that they are extremely intelligent. They do not realize that their minds are deceived and darkened by Satan. Although they understand philosophy and science, men do not understand the things of God or know the salvation of the Lord. Men do not have this capacity, because Satan has blinded them from such understanding and knowledge. People think that they are intelligent and sensible, yet they are inwardly blind and cannot see. They do not know their origin or their destiny. They do not know the way that they are walking or understand the life that they are living. They walk and live like blind men, going about and living blindly.</p>
<p>As the ruler of this age, Satan subjects man to himself; as the god of this age, he causes man to worship him. He hides behind or within many people, matters, and things. He does this in order to gain man&rsquo;s worship. Thus, when man worships or exalts a certain person, matter, or thing, he may unconsciously be worshipping Satan. Satan uses the persons, matters, and things that man worships to darken man&rsquo;s mind and to prevent him from knowing God. Many people do not know God because they have paid too much attention to money and position. Many people do not understand the Lord&rsquo;s salvation because they worship knowledge and skills. Men do not foresee their destiny or the torment of hell because they consider the pleasures and enjoyment of human life to be more important. Because their heart worships these things and their eyes esteem them, their mind is darkened and blinded by Satan.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The whole world lies in the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:19).</p>
<p>In addition to being subject to and blinded by Satan, man also lies in Satan&rsquo;s hand. In 1 John 5:19 Satan is called &ldquo;the evil one.&rdquo; Surely no good will come from man lying in the hand of the evil one. After blinding people, Satan manipulates and slaughters them as he pleases. How pitiful are those who lie in Satan&rsquo;s hand and are butchered by him! How pitiful are those who visit dance halls or gamble all night! How pitiful are drug addicts, alcoholics, and those who give themselves over to fornication and lasciviousness! Such persons allow Satan to damage their bodies and shorten their lives against their will. They may struggle, but they cannot free themselves, because they lie in the hand of Satan, the evil one.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The authority of Satan&rdquo;; &ldquo;the authority of darkness&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 26:18; Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>Satan has his own kingdom and authority. Men are subjects of Satan&rsquo;s kingdom, ruled and controlled by him under his authority.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Go...into the eternal fire prepared for the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 25:41).</p>
<p>As man lies in Satan&rsquo;s hand, his destiny is to go into the eternal fire prepared for Satan. In other words, man will go into the lake of fire and suffer eternally. Since man collaborates with Satan to sin against God, he will be punished with Satan in the eternal fire. Since man follows Satan to sin throughout his life, he will be punished forever with Satan. Since man walks with Satan, he will surely share Satan&rsquo;s end. How fearful this is!</p>
<p>This is man&rsquo;s condition before Satan. Having seen the condition of man, we can realize that man needs God&rsquo;s deliverance and God&rsquo;s salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE LOVE OF GOD&mdash;<br />
THE SOURCE OF SALVATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD IS<br />
THE SOURCE OF SALVATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God so loved&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s condition speaks of his need for salvation. The source of salvation is the love of God. God&rsquo;s love is the source of His salvation. If God had no love, man would have no salvation.</p>
<p>What is God&rsquo;s love? God&rsquo;s love is His heart. Although God is righteous and holy in His nature, His heart is love. God must do things according to His righteous procedure and in agreement with His holy nature. According to God&rsquo;s righteousness, sinners deserve only to be judged. According to God&rsquo;s holiness, such filthy ones are fit only to fall dead before Him. Although His righteousness condemns us and His holiness rejects us, God&rsquo;s heart loves us. He not only loves us; He &ldquo;so loves&rdquo; us. Because He loves us, He gave His only begotten Son to prepare salvation for us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Because of His great love with which He loved us&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:4-5).</p>
<p>While John 3:16 says that God so loved us, Ephesians 2:4 says that the love with which God loved us is a great love. Because of His great love, God came to save us. His great love caused Him to love not only sinners but also those who were dead in offenses and sin. Because He loved us even when we were dead in offenses and sins, He made us alive together with Christ and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;When...the love to man of our Savior God appeared...He saved us&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:4-5).</p>
<p>The love of God originated in God&rsquo;s heart, but when it appeared, it became our salvation. When God&rsquo;s love is manifested to us, it saves us. God&rsquo;s salvation comes out of God&rsquo;s love. God&rsquo;s saving hand issues out of His loving heart. God loves us in His heart; therefore, He also saves us with His hand. His loving heart appeared through His mighty hand to become our salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD<br />
ACCOMPLISHED SALVATION FOR US</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He gave His only begotten Son&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>God gave His only begotten Son to accomplish salvation for us. God&rsquo;s love caused Him to give us His Son. God did not love us without taking action on our behalf. The greatest thing God has done for us is to accomplish salvation for us. To accomplish salvation for us, God specially gave us His only begotten Son. This shows the greatness of God&rsquo;s love toward us as well as the preciousness of the salvation that God accomplished on our behalf. God&rsquo;s great love accomplished this precious salvation for us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live though Him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 4:9).</p>
<p>Because of His love for us, God sent His Son that we might have life. The salvation that God prepared for us is not only for us to be saved but also for us to have His life. In order that we may obtain His life, God was willing, because it was necessary, to send His only begotten Son into the world to accomplish a wonderful salvation for us. He was willing to do this for the simple reason that He loved us. Since God loved us, He was willing to suffer the sending of His only begotten Son for the accomplishment of our salvation so that we might have His life.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 4:10).</p>
<p>We had a problem in our relationship with God. Therefore, God sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins in order to restore our relationship with Him. God did this because of His love. Although sin caused a problem in our relationship with God, we had no thought of dealing with our sin in order to restore our relationship with God. Even if we desired to restore this relationship, we would have had no ability or way. However, God&rsquo;s love caused Him to send His Son to accomplish this matter for us before we even had such a thought.</p>
<p>Since our sins brought us under the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness, God could not receive us or abide with us peaceably. Therefore, God&rsquo;s love caused Him to send His Son as a propitiation for our sins so that He could receive us and abide with us peaceably according to the requirements of His righteousness and holiness. God&rsquo;s love fulfilled all the demands of God&rsquo;s righteousness and holiness.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:8).</p>
<p>The love of God also caused the Lord Jesus to die for us and to accomplish redemption for us. Since God loved us, He sent the Lord Jesus to die for us and to accomplish redemption for us. Despite His love for us, God could not forgive and save us carelessly, because He could not contradict His own righteousness and holiness. Before He could forgive or save us, God had to send the Lord Jesus to die for us in order to satisfy the demands of His righteousness and holiness. Because of His love toward us, God was willing to send the Lord Jesus to die for us and to accomplish our salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD<br />
CAUSES US TO OBTAIN SALVATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ...reconciling the world to Himself...We beseech you...Be reconciled to God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:18-20).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s love not only accomplished our salvation but also gave us a way to obtain salvation. How condescending God&rsquo;s love is toward us! It accomplished our salvation and devised a way for us to obtain salvation. If God had done less than this, we would not have been saved.</p>
<p>Having accomplished our salvation, God entreated us to be reconciled to Himself. We were far off from God, we had rejected and opposed Him, and we were His enemies. Nevertheless, He entreated us to be reconciled to Him. Many who have heard the preaching of the Word testify that they met many people who beseeched them to believe in Jesus. This demonstrates God&rsquo;s love. Believers do not entreat people to be reconciled to God out of themselves; rather, they do it because the love of God within them urges them to do so. Many who have not yet believed in the Lord have been entreated by relatives and friends to do so. This entreaty is a proof that God loves the unbelievers and desires that they obtain His salvation through those who believe.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He sent his slaves to call those who had been called to the wedding feast&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 22:3).</p>
<p>God prepared salvation as a rich feast. After it was prepared, He sent His slaves to call people to attend the feast and enjoy His salvation. The first group of servants God sent were the apostles. Since the time of the apostles, God has never ceased sending His slaves to call people to His feast of salvation. In the past two centuries God sent many servants to uncivilized places in Africa, to various Pacific islands, and to Asian countries to preach the gospel. Despite abundant hardships and dangers, these servants still went to preach the gospel to others. I have read the stories of some of the Western missionaries who came to China. Although they encountered every kind of difficulty in China, they still came because God&rsquo;s love urged and sent them.</p>
<p>When we draw near to the Lord, a mysterious force pushes us to preach the gospel. God loves the gospel; thus, if we tell the Lord that we are willing to go to the ends of the earth to preach the gospel, we will become extremely happy. God delights in urging people by means of His love to go out to invite others to receive His salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;We are witnesses...so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 5:32).</p>
<p>Because of His love, God not only sends His slaves to preach the gospel but also sends the Holy Spirit to work in the hearts of men. Without the work of the Holy Spirit, no one would believe, and no one would receive the Lord. The most important points of the gospel that we preach today are very difficult for man to believe in. These points include the Lord Jesus being God and being born of a virgin, crucified for man, resurrected from the dead and ascended to the heavens, seated in the heavenlies and dwelling in the hearts of men, and returning one day. These seven points are the center of the gospel. They are extremely difficult to believe in; in fact, it is impossible for someone with a practical mind who has studied science to believe in these points. However, when we preach, the Holy Spirit works until man believes. The more we declare that the Lord Jesus is God, the more people are delighted. The more we speak of the Lord Jesus dying for man, the more they believe. The more we say regarding the Lord Jesus living in the hearts of men, the more they are released. We obtain these wonderful results because of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit follows our speaking, confirming the gospel and touching man&rsquo;s heart until he is compelled to believe. God gave us His Son for the accomplishment of our salvation, and He also gave us the Spirit, who puts God&rsquo;s salvation into us; the Spirit causes us to experience God&rsquo;s salvation. This is the love of God.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Demonstration of the Spirit and of power&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 2:4; see also 1 Thes. 1:5).</p>
<p>God sends the Holy Spirit to witness to the gospel; He also uses power to testify to the gospel. Many times when we preach the gospel, God&rsquo;s power makes the gospel extremely powerful so that people are compelled to believe. Those who have a stubborn heart or who strongly oppose God will never repent and believe in order to receive salvation unless God uses His power to penetrate their hard heart and break their stubborn will. But when God&rsquo;s power operates, even the hardest and most stubborn person will repent and believe. This also is the love of God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;God bearing witness with them both by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:4).</p>
<p>In addition to the gifts of the Holy Spirit, God also uses signs, wonders, and works of power to confirm the gospel. When His servants preach the gospel, God confirms the gospel through healings and the casting out of demons, thus causing people to believe. This also is the result of His love. Because God loves man, He often works signs and wonders according to man&rsquo;s need in order to cause the doubting ones to believe in the gospel and to receive salvation.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 3:15).</p>
<p>Without the Bible we would not be clear regarding God&rsquo;s salvation. The Bible shows God&rsquo;s salvation clearly so that we may have the wisdom to understand such a salvation. This is another provision of God&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>Because God wants us to understand His salvation, He used more than forty people in many different places over a period of approximately sixteen hundred years to write the complete Scriptures. He also preserved the Bible throughout the ages by His mighty hand. In His sovereignty He brought about the translation of the Scriptures into many different languages so that people could read and understand them. What God&rsquo;s love has prepared for man in order that man may receive His salvation is altogether complete and absolute.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD<br />
CAUSES US TO BE HIS CHILDREN</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:1).</p>
<p>In addition to causing us to be saved and to escape destruction, God&rsquo;s love imparts the divine life into us so that we may be His children. What wondrous love that makes base sinners the children of the glorious God! No wonder the apostle John said, &ldquo;Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD LEADS US IN OUR LIVING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Our Father, who has loved us...comfort your hearts and establish you&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:16-17).</p>
<p>God not only regenerates us but also leads us day by day. When we are sad, He comforts us. When we are weak, He establishes us. From the day we are saved, we are in His hands. Because He saves us, He also leads us. This is His love.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:6).</p>
<p>God disciplines and scourges us because He loves us. He uses His rod to instruct us, to lead us to walk in His way, and to cause us to partake of His holiness.</p>
<p>Since God loves us, He will not allow us to be loose. When we try to walk in our own way according to our own will, He scourges, disciplines, and deals with us so that we will obey His leading and gain a profit in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LOVE OF GOD<br />
WORKS FOR US ETERNALLY</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;An eternal love&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 31:3).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s love is eternal; He loves us with an eternal love. Therefore, God will work for us throughout eternity; He bears an eternal responsibility for us.</p>
<p>Eternity surpasses time. Since God&rsquo;s love is eternal, it is outside of time and will not pass away when time passes away. Although time will end, God will still love us because His love is eternal.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He loved them to the uttermost&rdquo;</strong> (John 13:1).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s love for us will not change; He loves us to the uttermost. There is no change in Him; therefore, the love with which He loves us will never change.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Neither death nor life...will be able to separate us from the love of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:35-39).</p>
<p>Nothing will be able to separate us from the love of God&mdash;neither death nor life nor things present nor things to come. Even we cannot separate ourselves from God&rsquo;s love. We may forsake God&rsquo;s love, but God&rsquo;s love will never forsake us. We may cease to love God, but God will always love us. God has loved us from eternity past, and He will continue to love us into eternity future.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">CHRIST&rsquo;S REDEMPTION&mdash;<br />
THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the redemption of Christ. The redemption of Christ is the accomplishment of salvation. Salvation is accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s redemption. When we receive Christ&rsquo;s redemption, it becomes our salvation. Before we receive it, it is only redemption; after we receive and enjoy it, it is salvation. Redemption is objective to us, whereas salvation is subjective. Once we receive objective redemption, it becomes our subjective salvation. We can enjoy salvation only to the degree that we know redemption.</p>
<p>The accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s redemption is not only through His death but also through His resurrection, ascension, and second coming. Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, ascension, and second coming combine to complete a perfect redemption. We will first consider the death of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The death of Christ solves our problems in at least three aspects. We have already seen that the condition of man consists of problems in three aspects. Man has problems before God, problems in himself, and problems before Satan. The death of Christ on the cross solves these problems.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Solving Our Problems before God</h2>
<p>Before God, man is sinful and has a record of sin. The first problem that Christ&rsquo;s death solves is the problem of our sins before God.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who Himself bore up our sins in His body&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:24; see also 3:18; John 1:29; Isa. 53:5-6; 1 Cor. 15:3; Heb. 9:26).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was sinless. Although He was sinless, He was nailed on the cross to die because He bore our sins. The Lord Jesus was sinless, but when He died on the cross, God placed our sins upon Him so that He might bear them for us. Therefore, the Lord Jesus died for our sins, suffered for our offenses, and was crushed for our iniquities. On the cross He was smitten and judged by God for our sins. The Lord Jesus suffered on our behalf&mdash;that is, the Righteous suffered on behalf of the unrighteous&mdash;in order to eliminate our sins before God. If the Lord Jesus did not bear our sins and die, there would be no way for our sins before God to be removed.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;My blood...which is being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 26:28; see also Heb. 9:22; 1:3).</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s righteousness and law, sinners are condemned to die. No sinner can pass through the judgment of God&rsquo;s righteousness and law without suffering the punishment of death. For our sins to be forgiven, someone had to die and shed blood on our behalf in order to fulfill the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness and law. The Bible says, &ldquo;Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness&rdquo; (9:22). Thus, the Lord died and shed His blood on the cross to fulfill the righteous requirement of God&rsquo;s law so that our sins may be forgiven. Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood was shed through His death in fulfillment of God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, His blood can cleanse us of our sins.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ died for the ungodly&rdquo;; &ldquo;Having become a curse on our behalf&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:6; Gal. 3:13; see also Matt. 20:28; Heb. 2:9).</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s righteous law, a sinner should be cursed and should die. However, the Lord Jesus died for us under the judgment of the law; He tasted death on our behalf, became a curse for us, and gave His life as a ransom to redeem us out of the curse of the law.</p>
<p>The thorns that the Lord Jesus wore on His head while hanging on the cross were a sign of the curse. Thorns came into being as a result of the curse that man received for his sin (Gen. 3:17-18). The curse that man received because of sin was on the Lord&rsquo;s head as He hung on the cross. There the Lord was cursed on our behalf; thus, through His death He redeemed us from the curse of the law.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Having offered one sacrifice for sins&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:12).</p>
<p>The Lord died on the cross to offer Himself to God as a sacrifice for sins, thereby redeeming us from our sins and dealing with our sins before God. Just as animals sacrificed for sins did not bleed for their own sins but for the sins of those who offered them, the Lord died as our sin offering, accomplishing redemption for us before God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;He Himself is the propitiation for our sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:2; see also 4:10; Heb. 2:17).</p>
<p>Our sins caused a problem between us and God. Through His death as the propitiation for our sins, the Lord dealt with the sins that caused our problem with God and thereby restored our relationship with God. We were not only sinful but also were cut off from God. The Lord died to take away our sins and to bring God back to us. Therefore, He is our propitiation.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Reconciled to God through the death of His Son&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:10-11; see also Col. 1:20, 22; 2 Cor. 5:18-19).</p>
<p>Because of sin, we had a problem with God and were His enemies. The Lord&rsquo;s death redeemed us from our sins and restored our relationship with God; as a result, we were reconciled to God. Today, if anyone is willing to believe in the Lord, the Lord&rsquo;s death will reconcile him to God and appease God on his behalf.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Once for all...obtaining an eternal redemption&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:12; see also 10:14).</p>
<p>The redemption of the Lord on the cross was completed once for all; it is an eternal redemption. The Lord does not need to die separately for each of us. He died once, accomplishing a complete redemption for all, including those who lived before His death and those who lived after His death. He died once on the cross, obtaining an eternal redemption. The Lord&rsquo;s redemption, accomplished once for all, is eternally effective. When people believe in the Lord, the effectiveness of His redemption before God causes them to be redeemed.</p><h2 class="head2">Solving the Problems within Our Being</h2>
<p>The problem within our being is the sinful nature. The death of Christ dealt with our sins before God and with the sinful nature within us.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:6).</p>
<p>Our old man has the nature of sin. The old man with its sinful nature was crucified with Christ. The cross of Christ not only dealt with the sins that we commit; it also dealt with our sinful old man. Our sins and our old man were dealt with on the cross of Christ. The substitutionary death of Christ on the cross dealt with our sins; our co-death with Christ on the cross dealt with our old man. Christ died on the cross to deal with our sins before God so that we would no longer be condemned. Christ also brought us to the cross to die with Him in order to deal with our sinful old man&mdash;that is, to deal with the sinful nature within us so that we would not sin, be slaves to sin, or be ruled by sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:24).</p>
<p>Our corrupted flesh with its passions and its lusts was crucified and dealt with on the cross of Christ.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20; see also 6:14).</p>
<p>In addition to our flesh with its passions and its lusts, our self, our person, was also crucified with Christ. The cross of Christ dealt with our person.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You died with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:20; see also Rom. 6:8; 1 Pet. 2:24).</p>
<p>We were crucified with Christ; therefore, we died with Christ. This death caused us to be saved and released.</p>
<p>On the one hand, death is negative; on the other hand, it is positive. Through death man can be saved and liberated. Death can deliver and release man from the things that he could not otherwise be released or delivered from. By His death on the cross Christ delivers and releases us. Christ did not require us to die by ourselves; rather, He brought us to die with Him in His death on the cross. On the one hand, He died for us; on the other hand, He died with us. He brought us to the cross to die together with Him. We are one with Christ by faith; His death is our death. We died with Christ in His death; this co-death delivers us from our sins, from which we could not escape, and also delivers us from everything that binds and rules us.</p>
<p>The death of Christ is a very significant element in God&rsquo;s salvation. His death dealt with both our sins and our sinful nature. Because of sin, we were judged and condemned to the death of Adam; the death of Christ delivered us from sin. God required Adam to die in order to judge us; God required Christ to die in order to save us. God placed us in Christ so that we might be one with Him in His death; thus, we are saved and released. Our death with Christ depends not on our feeling but on the fact that we are in Christ. Regardless of whether we feel that we have died with Him, in Christ we have died with Him; this is a fact before God. We need to realize and see this fact. We should believe and receive this fact by faith. We are in Christ and in union with Him; thus, His death is our death. We should not pay attention to our feeling; rather, we should believe, saying, &ldquo;We died in Christ and with Christ.&rdquo; This is our release and rest. Hallelujah, we have died; what a release! Hallelujah, we have died; what a rest!</p>
<h2 class="head2">Solving Our Problems before Satan</h2>
<p>Our problems also include Satan and the world, which belongs to Satan. The death of Christ on the cross solved these problems.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;That through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:14).</p>
<p>The devil is Satan; he has the might of death. Satan has the power of death over sinners. We had no way to be delivered from him; neither could we overcome him. However, the Lord destroyed the devil through His death on the cross. In the original Greek, the word <em>destroy</em> means &ldquo;abolish.&rdquo; Through His death the Lord eliminated our sins before God, dealt with our sinful nature, and abolished the devil. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross abolished Satan, who has the might of death.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The ruler of this world has been judged&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:11; see also 12:31).</p>
<p>The ruler of this dark world is Satan. Through His death on the cross, the Lord Jesus judged the ruler of this world, Satan. At the cross our sins were judged and removed, and Satan was judged and cast out.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Destroy the works of the devil&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:8).</p>
<p>The Lord destroyed the works of the devil through His death on the cross. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross annihilated the devil and his works.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Bruise you on the head&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 3:15).</p>
<p>The serpent in Genesis 3:15 refers to Satan. To bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head means to put Satan to death. The One who bruised Satan&rsquo;s head is the seed of the woman, the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus was born of a virgin; therefore, He is the seed of a woman. On the cross He bruised the head of Satan, the ancient serpent (Rev. 20:2), putting Satan to death.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Stripping off the rulers and the authorities&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:15).</p>
<p>The phrase <em>the rulers and the authorities</em> in Colossians 2:15 refers to the evil spirits in the air, who assist Satan in ruling over this dark world (Eph. 6:12). They are the messengers of Satan. When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He destroyed and abolished Satan. In addition, He also stripped off the evil spirits who help Satan in ruling over the world. The Lord&rsquo;s cross destroyed both the prince of darkness, Satan, and his kingdom of darkness, including all its rulers and authorities.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Now is the judgment of this world&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:31).</p>
<p>The world is a systematic organization of Satan. Satan controls and usurps man through the various systems within this organization. All persons, matters, and things have been utilized by Satan as the system of his organization&mdash;the world&mdash;to control and usurp people. This usurping world of Satan was judged on the cross of Christ. Both Satan and the world under his authority were judged on the cross of Christ. The cross of Christ judged and abolished the ruler of the world; it also judged and abolished the world itself. If we realize that the cross of Christ judged the usurping world and all persons, matters, and things related to it, the world would lose its place and power in us.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The world has been crucified&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 6:14).</p>
<p>Our old man and the flesh with its passions and lusts were crucified on the cross of Christ; the world also was crucified on the cross of Christ. Our old man, the flesh, and the world all were hung on the cross. From the viewpoint of God and of those who belong to God, the world has been crucified. A dead thing has no power or place. The cross of Christ has dealt with the world.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that the death of Christ on the cross solved our problems. The cross of Christ dealt with sin, the old man, the flesh with its passions and its lusts, Satan, and the world. The cross of Christ was like a universal broom; it swept away every negative thing between us and God.</p>
<p>On the one hand, on the cross Christ bore our sins to suffer the judgment of death for us. On the other hand, He also carried us with Him to the cross. The Bible shows that Satan is mingled with fallen man. When we as fallen men were crucified with Christ on the cross, Satan, who was mingled with us, also was crucified. The world hangs on Satan and is under his authority. Since Satan was crucified on the cross, the world that hangs on him was crucified as well. Therefore, the death of Christ removed and dealt with all these things on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;It is finished&rdquo;</strong> (John 19:30).</p>
<p>Since the death of Christ took care of all these problems, He said, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; as He was about to die. Everything related to our salvation was finished through the death of Christ on the cross. Nothing was left for us to deal with, including sin, the old man, the flesh, Satan, or the world. Christ dealt with all these problems for us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus not only died for us; He also resurrected for us. His death solved our problems on the negative side, resulting in our redemption. His resurrection also accomplished many positive things, resulting in our salvation.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Raised for our justification&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 4:25; see also John 16:10).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection proves that His death satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements. Since His death satisfied God, God raised Him from the dead. His death paid our debt to God&rsquo;s righteousness. Although the debt was paid, the proof of His payment required a &ldquo;receipt.&rdquo; Although the Lord died to pay our debt, we would have no proof of His payment without His resurrection. Thus, we would not know whether His death satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement as well as God Himself. His resurrection was a &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; issued by God according to His righteousness upon payment of the debt. His resurrection declares that His death satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement; thus, God can justify us according to His righteousness. When we see the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and ascension, we are clear that our debt before God has been paid and that a &ldquo;receipt&rdquo; was issued. We no longer have any problems before God; God has justified us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead released His life and imparted His life into us by means of the Holy Spirit so that we could be regenerated. Therefore, His resurrection not only resulted in our justification objectively but also gave us a life that works out righteousness subjectively.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;If Christ has not been raised...you are still in your sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:17).</p>
<p>If Christ had not been raised, we would still be in our sins, because without His resurrection, we could not have received the life that delivers us from sin. Since Christ&rsquo;s resurrection caused us to obtain the life of deliverance, it has delivered us from sin. We have Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life; thus, we can have a sinless living in this sinful world.</p>
<p>A man who sold Bibles from village to village told people that if they would read the Bible, they would be able to refrain from sin. A scholar who heard him asked, &ldquo;How can man not sin in this world of sin?&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;It is possible! A fish can live in the sea without being salty.&rdquo; A person who possesses Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life can live in this sinful world without being contaminated by sin.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;In Christ all will be made alive&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 15:22, see also vv. 17-18, 20-21; John 11:25-26).</p>
<p>The death of Christ dealt with our sins. The resurrection of Christ delivered us from death, because Christ&rsquo;s resurrection gave us a life that cannot be held by death (Acts 2:24), a life that overcomes death and breaks the power of death. Those who believe in Christ and have His life &ldquo;shall by no means die forever&rdquo; (John 11:26); even if we should die, we shall live (v. 25).</p>
<p>We were dead in Adam, but through the resurrection of Christ we obtained His life. Christ&rsquo;s life swallowed death; thus, we can be delivered from death in Adam and live forever. Even if we die, we will be raised. Just as Christ&rsquo;s death eliminated the dread of sin and solved the problem of sin, His resurrection eliminated the fear of death and solved the problem of death.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Made us alive together with Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:5-6; see also Rom. 6:5; Col. 2:12).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way of salvation included not only our dying with Christ but also our being made alive together with Him. We died with Him; we were also made alive with Him. Dying with Him, on the negative side, delivered us from the old creation and everything apart from God. Being made alive with Him, on the positive side, brought us into the new creation and everything that is in God. His death delivered us from everything outside of God; His resurrection brought us into everything that is in God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:19).</p>
<p>We were made alive with Christ, and His resurrection life entered into us and is living in us. Because He lives, we also live. His resurrection and resurrection life cause us to live with Him. We live with Him by and through His resurrection life.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;It is Christ who lives in me&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:20).</p>
<p>We were raised with Christ and live with Him, and He also lives in us by His resurrection life. Christ not only died for us but also lives in us. He died for us on the cross, and in resurrection He lives in us. He died on the cross once for all according to God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, but He is always living in us so that we may live a holy life. His death on the cross satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement; His living in us causes us to live a life of holiness. He died for us that we might be justified; He lives in us that we may be sanctified. He lives in us to be our holiness, life, power, and everything.</p>
<p>God has not given us a dead salvation but a living salvation. Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection are the main elements of God&rsquo;s salvation. The death of Christ is related to the negative aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation, whereas the resurrection of Christ is related to the positive aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation. These two aspects show God&rsquo;s full salvation. God&rsquo;s salvation would be incomplete if either of these were missing. God could not solve our problems on the negative side without Christ&rsquo;s death, and God could not bring us into His riches on the positive side without Christ&rsquo;s resurrection. Praise and thank the Lord that Christ died and resurrected! God&rsquo;s salvation includes Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>After the Lord died and resurrected for us, He ascended for us. His death solved our problems, His resurrection enabled us to obtain God&rsquo;s life, and His ascension brought us into a heavenly position.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:8).</p>
<p>In the original Greek the phrase rendered <em>He led captivethose taken captive</em> means that He led captive the vanquishing power of the enemy. On the cross the Lord Jesus destroyed Satan and his power, and in His ascension He vanquished Satan&rsquo;s power to capture people. The Lord disarmed Satan, rendering him powerless to capture people.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:20-21).</p>
<p>The ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ put Him far above all that is on the earth as well as all that is in the air, where Satan rules. The Lord Jesus is above everything, both on the earth and in the heavens. In both space and time, in this age and in the coming age, He is far above all. He is over everything that belongs to the dark power of Satan. All things are under His feet.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:6).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s salvation we died with Christ and were made alive with Christ; we were also seated with Him in the heavenlies. God placed us in Christ, uniting us with Him; thus, we died and resurrected with Christ and are seated with Him in the heavenlies. The Christ who is seated in the heavenlies also lives in us. We are joined to the heavens by Christ who is within us. This is similar to an electric lamp in a home being connected to a power plant because of the electricity within the lamp. It is as if the lamp is in the power plant. Because of the life of Christ within us, we are joined to the heavenly Christ and seated together with Him in the heavenlies. As He is above all, so also are we. The power of darkness is under Christ&rsquo;s feet; therefore, it is also under our feet. Christ&rsquo;s ascension enables us to partake of this heavenly position, far above every enemy. If we remain in this heavenly position, every enemy is under our feet.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Your life is hidden with Christ in God&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:1-3).</p>
<p>The resurrection of Christ enables us to receive His life. Christ&rsquo;s life is God&rsquo;s life. We are joined to God with Christ in His life. We are in Christ, and Christ is in God; therefore, we are hidden with Christ in God. In God we are transcendent, above the earth; in God we rest and are kept.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God and having received...the Holy Spirit...He has poured out this&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:33).</p>
<p>In His ascension the Lord Jesus led captive those taken captive, brought us into the heavenlies far above all, and poured out the Holy Spirit that we might be endued with the power of the Holy Spirit to testify for the Lord Jesus on the earth. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit is a result of the ascension of the Lord Jesus; it also proves that He ascended. When we see the ascension of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is easy to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. The Lord&rsquo;s death enables us to put off our old man, His resurrection enables us to obtain His life, and His ascension enables us to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Having ascended to the height, He...gave gifts to men&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:8).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus ascended to the height, He poured out the Holy Spirit in order to empower us to testify. The Lord also gave different gifts, causing us to receive grace to serve Him in the church. In His ascension He poured out the Holy Spirit and gave gifts. The Holy Spirit empowers us for the Lord&rsquo;s testimony; the gifts equip us to serve the Lord and to build up the church. In order to serve Him, the Lord gave different gifts. This was accomplished in His ascension.</p>
<p>The Lord saved us so that we might serve Him. His death solved all our problems in order to free us from every kind of bondage. His resurrection imparted His life into us and made us alive together with Him. His ascension raised us far above Satan&rsquo;s power of darkness, and He gave the Holy Spirit and gifts, enabling us to serve Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s redemption includes His second coming. Without the Lord&rsquo;s return, we could not enjoy His full redemption. Although we were delivered from the punishment and power of sin through the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, we often still sense the presence of sin. We were delivered from a sinful living by the Lord&rsquo;s life, but we often still feel the working of sin within us. Today we witness many sinful situations around us. The life within us is spiritual and is connected to the heavens, but today we are still in the flesh on the earth. Furthermore, the earth is filled with darkness and evil, and everything on the earth gives us a negative sensation. Our bodies are weak and sick as well. All creation is decaying, groaning, and travailing in pain. Whenever we think of the Lord and fellowship with Him, we are inwardly soothed. Yet when we see evil situations, such as moral degradation and material corruption, our heart is grieved. All these negative things need to be set right by the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I...will receive you to Myself&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:3).</p>
<p>Although the Lord&rsquo;s ascension brought us into a heavenly reality and position, our actual entrance into the heavens awaits the Lord&rsquo;s coming and our rapture. We have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but we are still on the earth, which is full of evil, filthiness, turmoil, unrest, and pain. The earth cannot compare with the bright, heavenly home and the glorious, holy city that the Lord has prepared for us. In order to leave the earth, we need the Lord to return and rapture us. When the Lord comes again, He will rapture us to our heavenly Father&rsquo;s home. At that time we will be delivered from the earth, which is filled with suffering and sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The dead in Christ will rise first&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:13-18; see also 1 Cor. 15:23, 52; John 11:25; Rev. 20:4-6).</p>
<p>The Bible reveals that when the believers die, although their bodies are buried in the grave, their souls enter into Paradise. When the Lord returns, He will resurrect the dead believers by His power; that is, He will cause their souls to return from Paradise and their bodies to come up out of the grave. Their souls and their bodies will be united and become incorruptible. The believers will then be completely delivered from death and the grave.</p>
<p>We know the pain and grief of separation caused by death. If the believers have any saved relatives or friends who have died, the pain of separation will be removed only when the Lord comes to resurrect them, and we meet each other again. Therefore, when the Lord returns to resurrect them, they will be delivered from death and the grave; at the same time, we who are living will be delivered from the pain of separation from our friends and relatives. Their hope and our hope is in the Lord&rsquo;s coming again.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Then we [believers] who are living, who are left remaining, will be caught up...in the clouds to meet the Lord...and thus we will be always with the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 4:17).</p>
<p>When the Lord returns, the dead believers will be delivered from death and the grave and will be raised up. The living believers who are left remaining on the earth will be raptured out of the unrest and suffering on the earth together with the resurrected believers. They will meet the Lord in the air and will be with Him eternally. Although we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence within us, we are outwardly separated from the Lord and live in a world full of sufferings. When the Lord returns and we are raptured, we will be completely&mdash;even outwardly&mdash;delivered from the restless and painful realm of the earth to be with the Lord forever.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The redemption of our body&rdquo;; &ldquo;Who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:23-25; Phil. 3:20-21; see also Luke 21:27-28; Eph. 4:30; 1 Cor. 15:51-54; 2 Cor. 5:1-4).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s death redeemed our person, and His resurrection regenerated our spirit; thus, we were saved, transformed, and became a new creation. However, our body, which is contaminated and corrupted by sin, is not yet saved or redeemed. Because our body is still in the old creation and is ruled by corruption, it causes us to suffer and groan because of weakness, sickness, and pain. When the Lord returns, He will transfigure our contaminated, corrupted, and vile body &ldquo;to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo; (Phil. 3:21). He will change the nature of our body: corruptible will put on incorruption, and mortal will put on immortality. The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life will swallow up all the death in our body. Our body will be redeemed to enter into glory; our whole being will be redeemed to enter into the freedom of the glory of the children of God (Rom. 8:21). At that time we will obtain full sonship.</p>
<p>Our body is a temporal tabernacle. When we are clothed with our glorious body, we will enter into an eternal abode. Today we groan and toil in our temporal tabernacle, but when we enter into the eternal building, our groaning and toil will cease. This will be accomplished through the Lord&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The hope of glory&rdquo;; &ldquo;Like Him&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:27; 1 John 3:2-3).</p>
<p>Although the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection gave us His life and nature and made us like Him inwardly, we do not have His likeness outwardly. When the Lord returns, He will transfigure our body; we will have His glorious image outwardly and will be like Him in our whole being. This glorious likeness is the hope of glory. Today Christ is in us to be our life, but when He returns, He will saturate our body from within; that is, He will change our body so that it expresses His glorious image. This is the hope of glory. We will obtain this hope of glory when the Lord comes again.</p>
<p>Before the Lord&rsquo;s return, no one can realize the Lord&rsquo;s salvation to the uttermost. We must wait until the Lord returns in order to be made fully like Him. Then we will realize how high and wonderful His salvation is. At that time the Lord&rsquo;s life, which is the Lord Himself, will come out from within us to be our glory. Today He is the hope of glory within us. In the future He will come out from within us, transfiguring us to be completely like Him within and without. Our transfiguration is simply the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life saturating us from within until we are exactly like Him both inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Manifested with Him in glory&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:4; see also Rom. 8:17-19).</p>
<p>When the Lord comes again, we will not only enter into His glory but also appear with Him in glory. The Lord&rsquo;s resurrection enabled Him to enter into us to be our life, but His life within us is a hidden mystery and a hidden glory. In the Lord&rsquo;s ascension our life is hidden with Christ in God, but this also is a hidden mystery and a hidden exaltation. Only when the Lord returns will our hidden relationship in life and the mystery that has been hidden with Christ in God be manifested in open glory. At His return the Lord will reveal to the entire universe that He is our life within and our glory without and that we are joined with Him to God to appear in God&rsquo;s glory. What a glory that will be! What a glorious manifestation! We must say, &ldquo;Hallelujah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the glory that will appear to us is so great, the apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory to be revealed upon us&rdquo; (v. 18). Even the creation is anxiously waiting for us, the sons of God, to appear in glory (v. 19).</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Rest with us&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 1:7-10).</p>
<p>Although we have the Lord&rsquo;s peace and rest inwardly, we still face tribulation and persecution outwardly. When the Lord returns, He will rapture us to be with Him and will transfigure us. Then our entire being will fully enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s rest and enter into His peace and joy. The Lord will be glorified in us, and the people in the world will be surprised and marvel at the Lord in us.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;They...will reign with Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:6, see also v. 4).</p>
<p>We are a royal priesthood (1 Pet. 2:9). God saved us to serve Him in His presence, and He wants us to also be kings to reign over the people on the earth. Today we serve God as priests, but we are not yet kings ruling over the people on the earth. When the Lord comes again, we will reign with Him over the nations of the earth.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is indeed high. The Lord gave us His life that we may be the children of God, and He gave us His authority that we may be the kings of God. Through His resurrection we received His life to be God&rsquo;s children, but He must come again in order for us to receive His authority to be God&rsquo;s kings. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s coming will bring us to the highest point of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;They will not hunger any more, neither will they thirst any more&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 7:16-17).</p>
<p>As we live on the earth, we cannot escape the pressures of life, the difficulties of our environment, and natural calamities, all of which cause grief and tears. Only when the Lord returns and we are raptured to His presence will these things be removed completely. Then there will be no more hunger and thirst, no more hardships of life or natural calamities. The Lord will shepherd us and guide us to the springs of waters of life, and God will wipe away every tear from our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;He laid hold of the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years and cast him into the abyss&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 20:2-3).</p>
<p>Although the Lord judged Satan on the cross, that judgment has not yet been fully executed. Satan is still rampaging on the earth, especially tormenting God&rsquo;s children. When the Lord returns, He will fully execute the judgment that He accomplished on the cross upon Satan. Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss. He will be powerless to act or damage anyone.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s return will take care of many situations for us, accomplish many things for us, and bring us the blessings that can be received only at His coming back. Thank the Lord that His salvation includes not only His death, resurrection, and ascension but also His second coming. He died, resurrected, and ascended, and He will come again. His return is our hope of glory, a blessed hope. May we long for and await His second coming!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT&mdash;<br />
THE APPLICATION OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the work of the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit is the application of salvation. Salvation originated in God&rsquo;s love, was accomplished through Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and is applied through the work of the Holy Spirit. The work of the Holy Spirit applies the very salvation that came out of God&rsquo;s love and was accomplished through the redemption of Christ. Without God&rsquo;s love, salvation has no source. Yet without Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s love could not have accomplished salvation. Moreover, God&rsquo;s love and Christ&rsquo;s redemption require the work of the Holy Spirit in order to apply salvation to us.</p>
<p>We can illustrate God&rsquo;s salvation in this way: God is an author, Christ is a typesetter, the Holy Spirit is a printer, and we are sheets of paper. Because of His love, God wrote the story of salvation; through His redemption, Christ set the type for salvation according to God&rsquo;s writing; and the Holy Spirit then printed God&rsquo;s salvation, which was set in type through Christ&rsquo;s work onto us, the sheets of paper. Without the work of the Holy Spirit, what was accomplished through God&rsquo;s love and Christ&rsquo;s redemption would only be an objective redemption and could not become our subjective salvation. The work of the Holy Spirit turns our objective redemption into subjective salvation. Without the work of the Holy Spirit, Christ&rsquo;s redemption is only a fact in Him and is not experiential to us. The work of the Holy Spirit is necessary to transform the fact of our redemption in Christ into our subjective experience.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit works on us in four aspects.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REGENERATION&mdash;<br />
CAUSING THE BELIEVERS TO OBTAIN LIFE</h2>
<p>The first step of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work was to regenerate us. We were dead within, but the Holy Spirit imparted God&rsquo;s life into us so that we might be regenerated and made alive.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:8).</p>
<p>In order to regenerate man, the Holy Spirit first convicts man. He convicts man first concerning sin, then concerning righteousness, and then concerning judgment. The Holy Spirit convicts man concerning sin because he does not believe in the Lord Jesus. The Holy Spirit uncovers man&rsquo;s iniquities, unveiling them in man&rsquo;s inner consciousness scene by scene, as in a movie; thus, man sees that he is sinful, that he was born in sin, and that he will die in his sins unless he believes in the Lord Jesus (8:24). The Holy Spirit shows man that in Adam he is condemned already (3:18). If he will not believe in the Lord Jesus, he can only wait for perdition under judgment. The Holy Spirit reveals to man that God&rsquo;s charge to believe in the Lord Jesus is not only a God-given grace but also a commandment to sinners. If a sinner does not believe in the Lord Jesus, he not only rejects God&rsquo;s grace but also defies God&rsquo;s commandment. Therefore, unbelief is a great sin that can cause man to perish forever (Rev. 21:8). Furthermore, this is God&rsquo;s only commandment for sinners. Since man is sinful and has been judged, what God demands of man is that he believe in the Lord Jesus. God&rsquo;s unique commandment to sinners is that they believe in the Lord Jesus. Therefore, if a man will not believe in the Lord Jesus, he violates God&rsquo;s unique commandment and commits the unique sin. The Holy Spirit causes man to see all these things and thus to be convicted.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit convicts man concerning righteousness because the Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended to God. The Holy Spirit shows man that the Lord Jesus, who did not know sin, was made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). He bore our sins on the cross and satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement (1 Pet. 2:24); therefore, God raised Him from the dead both for our justification and as proof of our justification (Rom. 4:25). When we see that the Lord Jesus ascended into the heavens and is seated at the right hand of God, we realize that His death took care of our sins and satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. Now God can and even must justify those who believe in the Lord Jesus according to His righteousness. Since this is so, why would we not believe in Him? Thus, the Holy Spirit convicts man concerning righteousness.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit convicts man concerning judgment because Satan, the ruler of this world, has been judged. The Holy Spirit shows man that Satan, who opposes God and is God&rsquo;s enemy, has been judged on the cross of Christ. Since the ruler of the world, God&rsquo;s enemy, has been judged, how could those in the world, who follow Satan to be enemies of God, not be judged? Therefore, man should repent, leave Satan and his world, and turn to God. Since Satan was judged on the cross of Christ, he no longer has authority to control those who believe in Christ. Man is delivered from Satan&rsquo;s rule by Christ and His cross. Since this is so, why would man remain under Satan as an enemy of God awaiting judgment? Thus, the Holy Spirit also convicts man concerning judgment.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit convicts man concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment&mdash;that is, concerning the contents of the entire gospel. Sin is related to man, righteousness is related to God, and judgment is related to Satan. Man is sinful, God is righteous, and Satan is under judgment. Man commits sins, God justifies, and Satan awaits the judgment reserved for him. Sin is in Adam, righteousness is in Christ, and judgment is reserved for Satan. In Adam man is sinful and condemned, in Christ man is righteous and justified, and with Satan man is judged. On the cross Christ took care of man&rsquo;s sin, fulfilled God&rsquo;s righteousness, and judged Satan. If man believes in Christ, he is delivered from his sins, obtains God&rsquo;s righteousness, and is spared from Satan&rsquo;s judgment. If man does not believe, he remains in sin, has no part in God&rsquo;s righteousness, and ultimately shares Satan&rsquo;s judgment, entering into the eternal fire reserved for Satan as his companion forever (Matt. 25:41). When the Holy Spirit regenerates man, He reveals these things to him in order to convict him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully until she finds it&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 15:8).</p>
<p>The parable of a woman seeking a silver coin in Luke 15 unveils the work of the Holy Spirit within the heart of lost sinners, which causes them to repent and turn to God. The woman lights a lamp, sweeps the house, and seeks carefully until she finds the lost coin. This indicates that the Holy Spirit uses the Word of God, the Bible (Psa. 119:130), to shine in man, searching and examining him thoroughly to reveal his inward condition. The Holy Spirit searches until man repents, that is, until He finds the lost sinner, who is a treasure in God&rsquo;s eyes, and causes him to turn back to God. Those who have never been worked on by the Holy Spirit cannot convict themselves. Similarly, those who have not been enlightened or searched by the Holy Spirit cannot repent and turn to God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Testify concerning Me&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:26).</p>
<p>After the Holy Spirit convicts and enlightens a man and causes him to repent, He testifies to him concerning Christ. The Holy Spirit reveals Christ to man, showing him that Christ is the Savior of sinners and the One who bore man&rsquo;s sins on the cross. This leads man to receive Christ as his personal Savior.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Born of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:6, 8, see also vv. 3, 5).</p>
<p>When a man receives Christ as his personal Savior, the Holy Spirit immediately imparts God&rsquo;s life into him and regenerates him; thus, he is born of the Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The Spirit gives life&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:6; see also John 6:63).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit imparts the life of God into those who receive Christ as their Savior, thus enlivening the deadened spirit within them. Originally, man&rsquo;s spirit was dead through sin, but when he receives Christ as his Savior, his sins are forgiven and the Spirit enlivens his spirit.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:3).</p>
<p>When a man is regenerated by the Holy Spirit and his spirit is made alive, he becomes a living epistle of Christ. This living epistle is written with the Spirit of the living God; that is, God writes Christ into the believers by the Spirit, imprinting Christ into them. The believers possess the life of Christ and are joined to Christ; they are born again by receiving Christ as their life.</p><h2 class="head1">INDWELLING&mdash;LIVING IN THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>After the Holy Spirit regenerates us, He indwells us. He does not regenerate us and then leave. Rather, He lives within us as the indwelling Holy Spirit. After finishing the work of regeneration, the regenerating Holy Spirit immediately becomes the indwelling Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Holy Spirit Indwelling the Believers<br />
upon Their Believing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I will put My Spirit within you&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 36:27).</p>
<p>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, God not only imparts His life into us through the Holy Spirit, but also gives us His Spirit, putting the Spirit within us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Spirit...shall be in you&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:17).</p>
<p>When we believe in the Lord Jesus, God gives us the Holy Spirit to live in us and to be present with us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;In Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:13; see also Gal. 3:14).</p>
<p>When we believe in Christ, God gives us the Holy Spirit of the promise. Therefore, when we believe in Christ and receive Him as our personal Savior, we receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You are the temple of God, and...the Spirit of God dwells in you&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 3:16; see also 6:19).</p>
<p>Since the believers are indwelt by the Holy Spirit, they are the temple and habitation of God.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:9).</p>
<p>Romans 8:9 says that if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him. Conversely, if any man belongs to Christ, he must have the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God. One who belongs to Christ is a saved person; as such, he definitely has the Spirit of God. One who does not have the Spirit of God is not of Christ and is not saved. The highest grace a saved person can obtain is the Holy Spirit indwelling him. The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s indwelling is Christ&rsquo;s indwelling, and Christ&rsquo;s indwelling is God&rsquo;s indwelling. This is because the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God. God is in Christ, and Christ became the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). The Spirit indwelling us is Christ and God indwelling us, causing us to be joined to Christ and God and to belong to Christ and God. Therefore, one who is saved and belongs to Christ and God must have the indwelling Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Functions of the Holy Spirit<br />
Who Indwells the Believers</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit dwells in the believers not only to be present with them but also to do many things and to manifest many functions in them. The Holy Spirit reveals all matters related to life that have been given by God in Christ to the believers, which will be carried out in the believers, and all matters of the truth of God so that the believers may enter into them and experience them.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Were sealed with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:13; see also 4:30).</p>
<p>The first function of the Holy Spirit in the believer is to seal the believer. Once we are saved, God seals us with the Holy Spirit, marking us out as those who belong to God and are God&rsquo;s inheritance. Such a sealing separates us from the world. For example, there may be a few thousand hymnals in a room, but only the one that I have put my seal on belongs to me and is separated from the others. We know that we are persons who belong to God because once we believed, God placed His Spirit upon us as a seal (2 Tim. 2:19). After I put my seal on a hymnal, anyone who sees it will know that it belongs to me. The Holy Spirit in us and on us is the sign that we belong to God. This causes our thoughts, intentions, opinions, outlook, speech, attitude, actions, living, dealings with situations and matters, behavior, habits, and attire to be different from the world. Once others look at us, they know that we are Christians who belong to God.</p>
<p>As the seal on the believer, the Holy Spirit causes the believer not only to belong to God but also to be like God; He not only designates the believer as belonging to God but also shows that he is like God. For instance, the seal on my hymnal has the same appearance as the one in my pocket because I applied that very seal to the hymnal. The Holy Spirit cannot be separated from God and Christ. When He is imprinted into us, God and Christ are imprinted into us. The Holy Spirit is a seal on us so that we may look like God and Christ. He makes our thoughts, motives, conversation, actions, and all things like God and Christ and different from the world. When people see us, they not only realize that we belong to God and Christ, but they also sense that we are like God and Christ.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who is the pledge of our inheritance&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:14; see also 2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is not only a seal on the believers, proving that we belong to God and are God&rsquo;s inheritance; He is also the pledge, guaranteeing that God&rsquo;s inheritance in the heavens belongs to the believers and is the inheritance of the believers. The Bible tells us that God has kept an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance in the heavens for us, which will not fade away (1 Pet. 1:4). Before we inherit this inheritance, God gives His Spirit to us as a pledge, as a guarantee and earnest, guaranteeing that the heavenly inheritance belongs to us.</p>
<p>In the original language, <em>pledge</em> also has the meaning of a &ldquo;sample.&rdquo; This is like looking at a display or a sample of an item before we buy it in order to know its quality. It is also like a cook tasting a small portion of the food he has prepared in order to know the taste. The Bible says that eye has not seen and ear has not heard the things which God has prepared for us, nor have they come up in the heart of man (1 Cor. 2:9). Nevertheless, God, using the Holy Spirit as a sample, gives us a foretaste of these things. What the Holy Spirit gives us within&mdash;the presence of the Lord, the peace, joy, and sweetness of the Lord&mdash;is irreplaceable. Therefore, as the Holy Spirit seals us and makes us look like God and have a heavenly appearance, He also is a sample so that we may have a foretaste of God and of the heavenlies.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Spirit of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>In Romans 8:2 the Holy Spirit is referred to as the Spirit of life. This shows that the Holy Spirit is of life; God&rsquo;s life is in and from the Holy Spirit. He is not only the giver of God&rsquo;s life but also the reality of God&rsquo;s life. He and God&rsquo;s life are inseparable; if we were to separate these two, there would not be the life of God. The Holy Spirit manifests the power of God&rsquo;s life in us, leading us into the reality of God&rsquo;s life and enabling us to enjoy the riches of His life. We experience all that pertains to God&rsquo;s life through Him. Without Him we cannot experience life; apart from Him we also cannot have the reality of life.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Comforter&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:16).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in the believer is not only a seal, a pledge, and the Spirit of life but also a comforter. The word <em>Comforter</em> in the original language is <em>parakletos,</em> which means &ldquo;advocate&rdquo; or &ldquo;aide.&rdquo; In the New Testament this title is applied only to the Holy Spirit and to the Lord Jesus in 1 John 2:1 as our <em>Advocate,</em> which in the original language is also <em>parakletos.</em> As the Lord Jesus is our <em>parakletos,</em> so the Holy Spirit also is our <em>parakletos.</em> The Lord Jesus in the heavens is our Advocate before God; the Holy Spirit within us is our Aide before us. The two are also joined and connected. Through the Aide within us, the Holy Spirit, our Advocate in the heavens, the Lord Jesus, always transfers to us what He has done for us before God in the heavens that we may obtain comfort and joy. Similarly, the Aide within us, the Holy Spirit, always conveys our different situations and needs to God through our heavenly Advocate, the Lord Jesus, for us to receive God&rsquo;s care and supply. As the Lord Jesus represents us before God in the heavens regarding our blessing and profit, so the Holy Spirit is also in us and before us, representing the Lord Jesus, to minister to us and take care of us. When the Lord Jesus prays for us in the heavens, the Holy Spirit comforts and cares for us within according to the prayer of the Lord Jesus. Although the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens, the Holy Spirit represents the Lord Jesus and enables the Lord Jesus to live in us as our <em>parakletos</em> that He may be with us. At all times and in all places the Holy Spirit serves us and takes care of us, comforts us and guides us.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Led by the Spirit of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:14).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit continually leads the believers. He leads us in all things that we may live before God and walk in the light of God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The Spirit of reality...will guide you into all the reality&rdquo;</strong> (John 16:13).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus called the Holy Spirit &ldquo;the Spirit of reality.&rdquo; Only the Spirit can enable the believer to understand God&rsquo;s truth according to God. He reveals all the mysteries and the meaning of the truths in the Bible so that the believer can understand them and enter into them.</p>
<p>The indwelling Holy Spirit not only leads us to understand the meaning of the truth but also guides us into the reality. He is the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of all the truths. A truth without Him is but doctrine without reality. With Him, truth possesses reality. He is the reality of the truth.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of reality and the Spirit of life. Therefore, He gives life to the truth, making it alive. A truth without Him is but dead letters. He causes all truths to be full of life and to be living in all the believers, causing the believers to enter into the reality of life and truth.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The anointing...teaches you concerning all things&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:27; see also John 14:26; Acts 16:6-7).</p>
<p>The anointing refers to the moving of the Holy Spirit in the believer (Phil. 2:13). The Holy Spirit is the ointment, and His moving in us is the anointing. As an anointing causes a soothing and refreshing sensation, the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s moving within us also gives the same kind of feeling. By His moving and anointing, the Holy Spirit teaches us to know God&rsquo;s heart and will in all things. If something is according to God&rsquo;s heart and is one with God&rsquo;s will, the Spirit&rsquo;s anointing will give us a comfortable, joyful, peaceful, settled, flowing, and refreshing feeling. Otherwise, we will feel restless, uneasy, suppressed, stagnant, grievous, and dry. If what we think, say, and do pleases God and is what God desires, His anointing will seal and approve it; otherwise, the anointing will cause us to feel uneasy and without rest until we are controlled and led by Him.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;The Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:26).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit not only teaches us but also helps us. His teaching reveals our weakness, whereas His help cares for our weakness. He will help us in all the weaknesses that He exposes. In whatever matters we feel weak, He will help us. Our weaknesses are suited for His help. His help is manifested in our weakness.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;The Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:26; see also Jude 20).</p>
<p>The help that the Holy Spirit gives is subjective within us. He is within us, bearing us to do what we cannot do. The deepest and most subjective aspect of His help is that He Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. He is not only teaching us and leading us to pray but He is even praying for us. His prayer in us and for us is not with utterable words but with groanings which cannot be uttered. These groanings are unutterable to us because &ldquo;we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting,&rdquo; but they are not unutterable to Him (Rom. 8:26). We do not know how to utter the burden within us; therefore, we are short of utterable words to express our inner feelings. Although this is our case, the Holy Spirit uses groanings that cannot be uttered to pray for us so that we may discharge the burden within us before God by groanings, groaning out our inner feelings before God. We groan in this way because it is the Spirit within us who causes us to groan and who groans for us.</p>
<p>Often when we face a certain situation or difficulty, we do not know how to pray, but we sense a heavy burden. Although we sense a heavy burden, we do not have the words to express the burden and do not know how we should pray. It is then that the Holy Spirit prays for us according to God&rsquo;s intention with groanings which cannot be uttered so that we may discharge the burden and feeling within us before God with groanings. The more we groan like this, the more we feel soothed and relieved. If we groan until the burden is gone, we will utter praises, and our groaning will be changed to praise.</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit not only prays within us and for us with groanings that cannot be uttered but also leads us to pray in Him with utterable words, according to the sensation He gives us, not by our mind or our thoughts but by Him. He not only prays for us, but He also inspires us and leads us to pray.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;The comfort of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 9:31).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit not only teaches us and helps us but He also comforts us. When we encounter sufferings and grievous situations, He causes us to have the inward comfort of God. Whenever we are sad and grieving yet sense the comfort of God or a mysterious comfort within, this comfort is from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;Abound in hope in the power of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 15:13).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit also causes us to have hope. Often the outward environment and all its situations cause us to be discouraged and sad. But there is a certain power within that causes us to abound in hope and joy because of God. The power of the Holy Spirit in us makes us hopeful.</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Sanctification of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:2; see also 2 Thes. 2:13; Rom. 15:16).</p>
<p>A believer is also sanctified by the working of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit in the believer causes the believer to partake of God&rsquo;s holy nature and to be separated from the world according to the demand of God&rsquo;s holy nature. He causes us to sense what is contrary to God&rsquo;s holy nature so that we may be delivered from it, and He causes us to sense all that agrees with God&rsquo;s holy nature so that we may partake of this nature. He also causes us to have the sense of what is holy and to live a holy life.</p>
<p><strong>13. &ldquo;By the Spirit...put to death the practices of the body&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:13).</p>
<p>The practices of the body cause the believer the most frustration. The practices of the body can be put to death only by the Spirit. A believer&rsquo;s putting to death the practices of the body is also a work done by the Holy Spirit within him.</p>
<p><strong>14. &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit in the believer also causes the believer to be released and freed from sin and all kinds of bondage. Our deliverance from the law of sin and its bondage is not by our determination and struggle but through the operation of the Holy Spirit within us.</p>
<p><strong>15. &ldquo;The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, meekness, self-control&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:22-23; see also Rom. 14:17; 15:30).</p>
<p>These nine spiritual fruits are all borne by the Holy Spirit in the believers. As He causes us to live a spiritual life, He also causes us to bear spiritual fruit. A real spiritual living is the expression of the Holy Spirit in us.</p>
<p><strong>16. &ldquo;The fellowship of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:14; see also Phil. 2:1).</p>
<p>All spiritual fellowship, whether between the believer and God or between believers themselves, is a function of the Holy Spirit in the believers. We are able to fellowship with God and with the believers only when the Holy Spirit has a way in us. The moment the Holy Spirit loses His place in us, our fellowship with God and with the believers is lost.</p>
<p><strong>17. &ldquo;The oneness of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:3).</p>
<p>The oneness of the believers, or the oneness of the church, is the oneness of the Body of Christ. This oneness is a function of the Holy Spirit in the believers. It is the Holy Spirit in the believers who makes us one with one another. He not only causes us to be one with one another, but He Himself is the oneness of the believers and the oneness of the church. Without Him there is no oneness of the believers or oneness of the church.</p>
<p><strong>18. &ldquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>The freedom within a believer also comes from the indwelling Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit occupies His rightful place in us, He causes us to put off all bondage within and without, and thus we are freed.</p>
<p><strong>19. &ldquo;Filled with...the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:52).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit lives within us not only to do many things in us but also to fill us. He desires to completely occupy us inwardly. He desires to eliminate everything that is apart from Him and to occupy all the room in us and fill us. He is not separate from Christ and God. Therefore, His filling us is equal to Christ&rsquo;s and God&rsquo;s filling us. He fills us with Christ and God, causing us to be full of the life and person of Christ and God.</p>
<p><strong>20. &ldquo;Shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo;</strong> (John 7:37-39).</p>
<p>When the Holy Spirit fills us, He flows the Lord&rsquo;s life out from us as rivers of living water to quench others&rsquo; thirst.</p>
<p><strong>21. &ldquo;Transformed...from the Lord Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>The working of the Holy Spirit in the believers is for a glorious purpose, which is to cause the believers to be transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image so that they may be like the Lord. Daily He is changing us within and transforming our inward parts, thus mingling the Lord&rsquo;s element into us and giving us the Lord&rsquo;s image until we are like Him in every way. He desires to inwardly transform us until the Lord&rsquo;s life matures in us, causing us to be full of the image of Christ, according to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13).</p><h2 class="head2">The Permanence of the Indwelling<br />
of the Holy Spirit in the Believers</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Comforter...with you forever&rdquo;</strong> (John 14:16).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s living in us and being with us is not temporary but forever. Once the Holy Spirit begins to live in us, He will be with us forever, never to leave. Contrary to what some people think, He will not leave us when we disobey Him and grieve Him. Our disobedience, trespasses, and offenses can only cause Him to be grieved and sad (Eph. 4:30); they cannot cause Him to leave us or forsake us. Once He is with us, He is with us forever. Praise the Lord!</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:30).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit abides in us as the seal of God&rsquo;s ownership as well as the pledge of our heavenly inheritance unto the day of redemption. The day of our redemption is when the Lord returns and when our bodies are transfigured to enter into glory. Therefore, the Holy Spirit lives in us and is with us to do different works in us and to manifest various functions in us until the Lord comes, and we are raptured and transfigured.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Responsibility of the Believer<br />
to the Indwelling Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>We are responsible to the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not quench the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:19).</p>
<p>The first responsibility we bear concerning the indwelling Holy Spirit is that we should not quench Him. The original meaning of <em>quench</em> implies dousing fire with water. The Holy Spirit moves within us like a burning fire; we should not pour water on the Holy Spirit to quench His inspiration. For example, when we draw near to God in prayer, the Holy Spirit may touch us to confess to others. If we suppress this feeling and reason against it, we will quench the feeling, pouring &ldquo;water&rdquo; over it. We should never do this.</p>
<p>We should not fear the intense moving of the Holy Spirit within us. The more we allow the fire of His inspiration to burn, the more intensely He will burn. We must obey His moving within us. If He touches us not to wear a certain piece of clothing, we should obey and not wear it. If He touches us not to do a certain thing or say a certain word, we should obey by not doing that thing or speaking that word. If we obey and do not quench His move, He will burn us and cause us to be revived.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:30).</p>
<p>Our second responsibility to the indwelling Holy Spirit is to not grieve Him. He is the oil of exultant joy (Heb. 1:9), anointing us within. If we are obedient, He will make us joyful. If we neglect, disobey, quench, and go against His anointing and moving within us, He will be grieved, making us gloomy and unhappy.</p>
<p>Christians should be joyful, but many brothers and sisters are depressed and unhappy because they do not obey the inspiration of the Holy Spirit; rather, they grieve Him. Whenever the Holy Spirit is joyful in us, we will be joyful. Whenever the Holy Spirit is grieved within, we will be gloomy. Our being joyful or gloomy is the evidence that we are those who obey the Holy Spirit or those who go against the Holy Spirit. Our being joyful or gloomy is the proof that we have obeyed the Holy Spirit, making Him happy, or that we have gone against the Holy Spirit, grieving Him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Walk by the Spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;Walk...according to the spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:16, 25; see also Rom. 8:4).</p>
<p>On the negative side, we must not quench or grieve the indwelling Holy Spirit; on the positive side, we must walk according to Him. There is no brother or sister who has absolutely no inspiration and movement of the Holy Spirit within. It is crucial to submit to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration and move. If we obey the move and touch of the Holy Spirit, we will be more enlightened, more keen within, and will more readily understand the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration and move. The Holy Spirit will also give us further feeling and moving. If we continue to obey the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration and move, walking according to the Spirit, we will not lose His leading and guiding, His caring and strengthening.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Mind...the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:5).</p>
<p>On the positive side, regarding the indwelling Holy Spirit, we should not only walk according to Him, but we should even mind Him. To mind is a function of our mind. If our heart loves the Lord and desires to please Him, to fellowship with Him in His Spirit, and to allow His Spirit to lead us in our walk, we must mind the Spirit. Our mind controls us the most. If our mind minds things other than the Holy Spirit, we will not be able to walk according to the Holy Spirit. To walk according to the Holy Spirit, we must consider Him and mind Him. If we consider Him and mind Him continually, we will not lose the sense of His presence; rather, we will fully enjoy sweet fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Be filled in spirit&rdquo;; &ldquo;Filled...with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:18; Acts 13:52).</p>
<p>It is also our responsibility to be filled with the indwelling Holy Spirit. &ldquo;Be filled in spirit&rdquo; is a commandment from God that we are responsible to obey. We must seek to be filled with the Holy Spirit, and we must allow the Holy Spirit to fill us. We must let Him remove sin, the world, the flesh, and all that is outside of the Lord so that He may have His full place in us. We must allow Him to possess and fill our whole inward being.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Full...of the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 6:5, see also v. 3; 7:55; 11:24; Luke 4:1).</p>
<p>Not only are we responsible to be filled with the Holy Spirit, but we are also responsible to be full of the Holy Spirit. A person is full of the Holy Spirit after he is filled with the Holy Spirit. To be filled with the Holy Spirit is to pass through a gate at a certain point of time; to be full of the Holy Spirit is to maintain a constant condition. We not only must arrive at the infilling of the Holy Spirit temporarily, but we also must constantly maintain a condition of being full of the Holy Spirit. Although we are filled with the Holy Spirit and are full of the Holy Spirit, we may lose the infilling we have obtained if we are careless or unfaithful. To keep what we have obtained by the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s continuous filling, we must be responsible to always be full of the Holy Spirit. We must allow the Holy Spirit to deal with and remove all that can cause Him to lose His place in us. To maintain the condition of being full of the Holy Spirit, we must allow the Holy Spirit a free way in us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OUTWARD FILLING&mdash;<br />
COMING UPON THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work on us is not only within us but also without. On the one hand, the Lord Jesus told us that the Holy Spirit would be in us (John 14:17), and on the other hand, that He would come upon us (Acts 1:8). By being in us, He works within; by being upon us, He works without. Many do not see a distinction between the inward and the outward aspects of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work. Actually, this distinction is extremely clear in the Bible.</p>
<p>The inward working of the Holy Spirit is related to life. This meets our needs related to the aspect of spiritual life. However, before God there are also needs related to the aspect of spiritual work. Therefore, the Holy Spirit also works without to meet our needs in this respect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Baptized in the Holy Spirit upon Believing</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit first works outside the believers to come upon them, baptizing them into Himself.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Will baptize you in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 3:11).</p>
<p>Concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit, John the Baptist first prophesied that the Lord Jesus would baptize us with the Holy Spirit, that is, into the Holy Spirit. This prophecy by John the Baptist was not fulfilled when the Lord Jesus was on the earth.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Baptized in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:5; see also 11:15-16).</p>
<p>Later, when the Lord Jesus was about to ascend into the heavens, He promised the disciples that they would be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from then. This promise of the Lord Jesus was fulfilled after His ascension in two parts, at two different times, in two different places, and on two kinds of people. The first part was accomplished during Pentecost in the upper room on the disciples in Jerusalem and on the Jewish believers (2:1-4). The second part was accomplished after Pentecost in the house of Cornelius in Caesarea and on the Gentile believers (10:44-47). These two parts comprised the complete baptism in the Holy Spirit. The fulfillment of these two parts was not two baptisms at different times; rather, it was the completion of two parts of a single baptism, the one unique baptism. In the two-part completion of this baptism, the one unique baptism, the Lord Jesus baptized His whole church&mdash;including all the believers in every age&mdash;into the Holy Spirit. In the two-part completion of this baptism, the one unique baptism, the Lord Jesus baptized all the believers in every age in the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the baptism in the Holy Spirit is an accomplished fact, just as the death of the cross is an accomplished fact. This fact of baptism has been accomplished on the church. Thus, when a believer obtains life by faith and becomes part of the church, he also shares in the baptism the church received. This is like a person who becomes wealthy. Once he has a child, the child automatically is part of the family and shares in his riches. Just as a child can enjoy the riches the father earned, the believers can enjoy the baptism the church obtained.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:13).</p>
<p>Because the Lord Jesus baptized the whole church in the Holy Spirit through the two-part completion of baptism, 1 Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized...whether Jews [represented by the people in the upper room in Jerusalem at Pentecost] or Greeks [represented by the people in the house of Cornelius in Caesarea].&rdquo; All the believers&mdash;past, present, and future, whether Jews or Gentiles&mdash;have been baptized in one Spirit. According to the fact of baptism, once a person becomes a believer through faith, he is already baptized in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Filled Outwardly with the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>According to fact, once a believer believes, he is already baptized in the Holy Spirit. According to experience, however, many believers have not experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit. All believers have part in the fact of the baptism and have obtained the position to enjoy such a baptism, but many believers do not have the experience and the enjoyment of baptism. Therefore, they still need to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Filled with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:4; see also 4:8, 31; 9:17; 13:9; Luke 1:15, 41, 67).</p>
<p>There is a difference in the Greek between being filled with the Holy Spirit in these verses and being filled with the Holy Spirit as mentioned previously. (Regrettably, many regard these two as one.) In the previous verses the Greek word means to be filled inwardly. This word is used in reference to the Holy Spirit filling us inwardly that we may be full of the life of Christ to live out the image of Christ. In these verses, however, a different Greek word is used to speak of being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly. It is the Holy Spirit coming upon us, causing us to be full of the Lord&rsquo;s power to testify for Him. To be filled inwardly with the Holy Spirit is for life, bringing about the maturity of life. To be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit is for work, resulting in power for work.</p>
<p>To be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit is to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. These two are one matter. One is the fact, and the other is the experience. The baptism in the Holy Spirit is a fact that the church has received; being filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit is an experience that the believer should obtain. The fact was received by the entire church and was accomplished once and for all; the experience should be obtained by the believer personally and be accomplished repeatedly. According to the fact, the whole church has been baptized in the Holy Spirit. Experientially, many believers have not yet been filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Holy Spirit comes upon you&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:8; see also 8:15-17; 19:6; Luke 24:49).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit comes upon the believers (note that it says &ldquo;comes upon&rdquo; and not &ldquo;enters into&rdquo;) to cause them to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit; this is to experience the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit comes upon a believer, he is filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit, experiences the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and thus receives the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. Although many brothers and sisters have had the Holy Spirit enter into them to dwell in them, they have not yet had the Holy Spirit come upon them. Therefore, at most they have the filling of the Holy Spirit within, not the filling of the Holy Spirit without. Although they have experienced the regeneration and indwelling of the Holy Spirit, they have not experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit. They have the experience of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s being in them, but they should seek the outward experience of the Holy Spirit also.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Receive power...be My witnesses&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 1:8; see also Luke 24:49).</p>
<p>A believer receives power when the Holy Spirit descends upon him, filling him with the Holy Spirit. This is the result of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit comes upon us to fill us outwardly, leading us to experience the baptism in Him that we may be empowered to be witnesses for the Lord. The Holy Spirit came into us that we may have life; the Holy Spirit comes upon us that we may receive power. The reason that many believers have life but not power is because they have experienced only the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s entering into them and not the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s coming upon them.</p>
<p>Dear brothers and sisters, you might be such a believer. Although you have the Lord&rsquo;s life and love the Lord, and although you are well behaved and have a certain amount of spiritual learning and dealing, you have no power to testify for the Lord. You can study the truth by yourself, but you cannot preach the gospel to others. You can pray softly in private, but you cannot praise loudly in public. You are restrained and bound; you have no freedom or release. You are timid and shy; you have no boldness to testify for the Lord. All this proves that you have not had the Holy Spirit come upon you, you have not been filled with the Holy Spirit without, and you have not experienced the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit comes upon you and fills you outwardly, causing you to experience the baptism in Him, you will immediately be released, obtain freedom, receive power, and have boldness to preach the gospel publicly, and you will be able to testify for the Lord in all situations. (We will study the matter of being filled with the Holy Spirit outwardly more carefully in chapter 27.)</p><h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION&mdash;<br />
TO IMPART GIFTS TO THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer is not just to come upon the believer to empower him but also to give him spiritual inspiration and gifts. These two steps, the coming upon and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, include all the work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer. These two steps of the work of the Holy Spirit outside of the believer are related. The Holy Spirit coming upon the believer is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on him, often resulting in his receiving spiritual inspiration and spiritual gifts. Although the coming and outpouring of the Holy Spirit does not always cause the believer to receive spiritual gifts, a believer must have the Holy Spirit come upon him and must have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in order to receive spiritual inspiration, and hence, spiritual gifts. Such spiritual gifts always come from the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;There are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:4-11).</p>
<p>Spiritual gifts are spiritual abilities and skills, enabling the believer to do spiritual things and to manifest spiritual functions. Whether these gifts are healing, working wonders, prophesying, tongues, or other gifts, they are the abilities and skills of the Holy Spirit that enable a believer to do spiritual work and fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. Although there are distinctions and different measures of gifts, these spiritual abilities and skills come from the inspiration of the same Holy Spirit: &ldquo;The one and the same Spirit operates all these things, distributing to each one respectively even as He purposes&rdquo; (v. 11).</p>
<p>The work of the Holy Spirit outside the believer not only empowers the believer to work for the Lord but also gives gifts to him, enabling him to do God&rsquo;s work. Just as the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s coming upon the believers through His outpouring causes believers to be empowered, so also His inspiration on believers through His outward moving causes them to be gifted. Power is a matter of strength, whereas gifts are a matter of skill. A believer can carry out an intense spiritual work for the Lord in order to serve God only when power is combined with gift and gift is added to power.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;To each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for what is profitable&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:7).</p>
<p>The manifestation of gifts in the believers through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit causes the believers to work for God and accomplish God&rsquo;s great plan. These gifts are also given to every believer for what is profitable. All the gifts given through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit enable the believer to do things for God so that all may profit. Any gift of inspiration that does not profit others is questionable.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Say, Jesus is Lord...in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 12:3).</p>
<p>The inspiration of the Holy Spirit is given for what is profitable and also causes one to say, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord.&rdquo; The outpouring of the Holy Spirit proves that the Lord Jesus has been made both Lord and Christ by God (Acts 2:33-36). Thus, the goal of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration is not merely to profit others but also to exalt the Lord Jesus, causing the believers to confess that Jesus is Lord. All inspirations that do not produce a confession that Jesus is Lord are not of the Holy Spirit but of evil spirits. All who are inspired by the Holy Spirit will say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among the four steps of the work that the Holy Spirit accomplishes on the believers, two are inward and two are outward. Regeneration and indwelling occur in the believers, whereas outward filling and inspiration occur outside the believers. Regeneration and indwelling are for the spiritual life of the believers so that they may have both a beginning and a maturity in their spiritual life. Outward filling and inspiration are for the spiritual work of the believers so that they may possess both power and gifts for spiritual work.</p>
<p>A healthy, normal Christian who is up to the standard has balanced and adequate experiences of these four aspects of the work of the Holy Spirit. He has the regenerating and indwelling Spirit within so that he may have a rich and matured life. He also has the filling and inspiring Spirit without so that he may do a strong spiritual work. We should not think that because we have regeneration and indwelling within, we have no need of filling and inspiration without. Even more, we must not confuse outward filling and inspiration with inward regeneration and indwelling. These four aspects of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s work should not be mixed or substituted for each other. We should have His regenerating and indwelling inwardly as well as His filling and inspiring outwardly.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">REPENTANCE AND BELIEVING&mdash;<br />
THE CONDITIONS FOR OBTAINING SALVATION</h1>
<p>In this chapter we come to the matters of repentance and believing. Repentance and believing are the conditions for man to obtain salvation. In order for man to obtain God&rsquo;s salvation, he must repent and believe. God accomplished redemption for man through Christ and will apply Christ&rsquo;s accomplished redemption to man through the Holy Spirit because of His great love. However, if man does not repent and believe, redemption cannot become salvation to him. Man must repent and believe in order for God&rsquo;s redemption to become salvation to him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REPENTANCE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Repentance</h2>
<p>According to the original language in the Bible, repentance is related to a change of mind. This differs from the human understanding of repentance, which is related to correction and self-reformation. Since man fell, his mind has turned away from God toward many persons, things, and matters. Moreover, man is dominated by his own mind, &ldquo;doing the desires...of the thoughts&rdquo; (Eph. 2:3). Man speaks what is in his mind and acts according to his thoughts. Whether the desires of his thoughts are good or evil, man&rsquo;s mind is turned away from God while facing a host of persons, things, and matters apart from God. Since man&rsquo;s mind is turned away from God and turned toward matters apart from God, his deeds and behavior are continuously apart from God and directed toward other things. Therefore, man needs to repent, to have a change in his mind. Once man&rsquo;s mind changes, his deeds and behavior will change.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;That they should repent and turn to God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 26:20).</p>
<p>Since man&rsquo;s mind rules his actions and behavior and is turned from God to many things outside of God, there is a need for a change in his mind so he may turn in both his thoughts and deeds from things apart from God back to God. Originally, man&rsquo;s thoughts are toward things apart from God, and these direct man to carry out things that are apart from God. Everything related to the fallen man, who is controlled by his mind, is turned from God toward things apart from God. When man sins and commits evil, he is turned from God. However, when he does things that are outwardly righteous and good, he still has his back toward God. Just as his sinful and evil acts are apart from God and toward wickedness, his proper and good acts also are apart from God. If he loves the world, he will choose the world instead of God, but if he wants to ascend above the world, he will strive toward that goal rather than God. If he wants to be fashionable, he will choose modernity instead of God, but if he is content to be old-fashioned, he still will not be directed toward God. If he is stingy and greedy, he will direct his efforts toward money instead of God, but if he is charitable and generous, he will direct his efforts toward charity rather than God. If he is gluttonous and lascivious, he will long for things instead of God, but if he is self-disciplined and virtuous, he still will not long for God. He can set his mind on a host of things, having no thought in the slightest toward God. All his thoughts and doings are related to goals, but none of these goals are God Himself. He wants everything except God. Consequently, man needs to repent and turn to God; he needs to have a change in his mind. Such a turn begins with the mind; then it will affect his outward actions and behavior until his entire life and being are turned toward God.</p>
<p>Repentance is not self-correction or even a forsaking of things but a turn to God. A person who loves going to movies may feel it is wrong and stop going. This is the human concept of repentance, not the biblical concept. According to the Bible, a person should repent because he is convicted of his love for movies instead of God. His change of mind is from movies to God, and henceforth, he desires God instead of movies. Repentance according to the human concept does not cause a person to turn to God; this is not the repentance that God desires. A person may give up movies, but if he turns to other things, even proper things, his mind is still not turned to God. The repentance that God desires is a turn of the human mind toward Himself. This is not simply a matter of correction but a matter of no longer rejecting God. This is not a matter of changing from being bad to being good but of turning from godless things back to God Himself. Thus, one needs to repent of what he regards as proper and good. Even the most proper and upright person can be turned away from God very much. He may be faultless but without God; he may deplore evil but reject God. Thus, he needs to repent, to have a change of mind, to turn from proper and good things back to God. True repentance causes man to turn back to God, to turn from not wanting and not facing God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Repentance unto God&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:21).</p>
<p>Since repentance is a turn to God, genuine repentance must be a repentance unto God. Those in the world demand a repentance unto uprightness and goodness, but God requires a repentance unto Himself, not just to what is good and right. A person may change from being wicked to being kind and from being wrong to being right, without turning to God. Before such a change, he is toward evil rather than toward God; once he changes, he may pursue (or be inclined toward) things that are good and proper, but he is still not toward God. This is not the repentance that causes man to receive salvation. According to the Bible, the repentance that results in man&rsquo;s salvation can never be unto anything other than God Himself. Nothing outside of God can be the object of true repentance.</p><h2 class="head2">Repentance Being a Gift from God</h2>
<p>True repentance is granted to men by God because of His mercy.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God...to give repentance&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 5:31; see also 2 Tim. 2:25).</p>
<p>Because God wants man to receive His salvation, He enlightens man&rsquo;s mind by His Spirit so that man will see his condition of being far from God and realize his need to turn back to God. Then He touches man&rsquo;s feelings and gives him a repentant heart so that he will turn from everything apart from God back to God. Initially, people love sin, covet the world, and desire many things. One day, however, God, by the Holy Spirit, has mercy on them, causing their thinking to turn from sin, the world, and other things back to God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;God has given repentance unto life&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 11:18).</p>
<p>Many people, who never had a desire for God or even considered God were graced by God at a certain point in time through His mercy; God arranged their environment in order to give them a heart to repent and wholeheartedly turn back to God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s kindness is leading you to repentance&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 2:4).</p>
<p>Because man forsakes God, commits sin and evil in rejecting God, and offends God, he should be punished and destroyed by God. Yet God exercises forbearance and patience because of His kindness. His patient and forbearing kindness leads man to repentance so that man may turn to Him. The reason that so many have survived terminal illness, calamities, wars, bombings, plane crashes, and disasters at sea is because God&rsquo;s kindness patiently bore with them, giving them the opportunity to be led to repentance so that they might turn back to God and obtain salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Repentance Being Prior to Believing</h2>
<p>Every genuine act of believing is preceded by repentance. Every true act of repentance is followed by believing. Believing is the proof of repentance. Where there is repentance, there is also believing. These two acts are closely related and cannot exist without each other.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Repent and believe in the gospel&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 1:15).</p>
<p>One must repent in order to believe in the gospel. There is no believing without repentance. Believing without repentance is not genuine. Real faith comes from believing, which follows repentance. How can a person receive the gospel without an inward change? Without an inward turn, an outward confession of the gospel is useless.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Repentance unto God and faith in our Lord Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 20:21; see also 19:4).</p>
<p>There must first be repentance unto God before there can be faith in the Lord Jesus. In order for the heart to believe in the Lord Jesus, the mind must first turn to God. Only those whose minds are turned to God can receive the Lord Jesus as their Savior. Those whose minds are not turned to God cannot sense their need of the Lord Jesus and therefore will not have faith in Him. When a person acknowledges his own sinfulness and corruption, including the fact that he has turned away from God and rejected God, he will grieve and become remorseful. Then he will turn to God and be able to believe in his heart in the Lord Jesus as his Savior. To believe in the Lord Jesus, he must first repent to God.</p>
<p>God specifically sent John the Baptist to preach repentance so that men might turn and believe in the Savior whom He would send and to prepare their hearts to receive His salvation. After John the Baptist came to preach repentance, the Lord Jesus followed to tell people to believe. Repentance is for believing and ushers in believing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Relationship<br />
between Repentance and Salvation</h2>
<p>There is a definite relationship between repentance and salvation. One must repent in order to be saved, and in order to obtain salvation, one must pass through repentance.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 3:2).</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is the ruling of the heavens. This heavenly kingdom, this heavenly reign, is expressed first as a reality in man today and will then be practically manifested in the millennial kingdom. To share in this heavenly kingdom and rule, man must repent. When man is turned away from God, he is not restricted by God and does not submit to God&rsquo;s rule. He is wild and unrestrained, doing whatever he wants, however he wants, and thus commits unimaginable acts. His sinful and evil deeds are not under God&rsquo;s rule, but even his charitable and just deeds are not under God&rsquo;s rule. Whatever he does is not subject to God&rsquo;s authority. In order for the kingdom of the heavens to reign in him, he must repent; he must have a change in his mind. He must turn from everything that is not restricted by God and not subject to His rule, submitting himself to the heavenly reign to be under the rule from above. Moreover, if he wishes to participate in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the future, he must live in the reality of the kingdom today, allowing heaven to rule in him. For this he must repent. Only those who repent and turn from everything that is not subject to God and who submit to the heavenly authority may partake of the kingdom of the heavens. Only these will live in the reality of the heavenly kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation not only causes us to escape perdition and obtain eternal life, but it also saves us under God&rsquo;s authority, allowing heaven to rule in us and us to be subject to the heavenly reign. To share in such a salvation of God, we must repent from all that refuses the rule of God and submit ourselves under God&rsquo;s heavenly government. There is a crucial relationship between repentance and our participation in the heavenly kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Prepare the way of the Lord; make straight His paths...all flesh shall see the salvation of God&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 3:4-6).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is the entrance of the Lord into man to be his salvation. For man to obtain God&rsquo;s salvation, he must first allow the Lord to enter into him. Repentance prepares the way for the Lord to enter. Before God sent the Lord Jesus to bring salvation to men, He first sent John the Baptist to preach repentance so that a straight and smooth way might be prepared in men&rsquo;s hearts for the Lord to enter. If one does not repent and have a change in his mind, turning his whole being to the Lord, the Lord has no way to enter into him to bring in God&rsquo;s salvation, even if He so desires. Yet when a man&rsquo;s mind turns to God to make a way for Him, the Lord immediately enters into him to be his salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Repentance for forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:47; see also 3:3; Acts 5:31).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s gospel causes man to repent and to receive forgiveness of sins. To forgive sins, God must first grant man repentance. If man does not regret his sin of turning away from God and return to God in his heart, he will not believe in the Lord Jesus. Thus, he will not be able to obtain God&rsquo;s forgiveness. To be forgiven, man must repent and regret his dead works to turn back to God (Heb. 6:1).</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Repentance unto life&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 11:18).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s gospel causes man to be forgiven so that he may obtain the Lord&rsquo;s life (Col. 2:13). Hence, for man to obtain the Lord&rsquo;s life, he must repent, realizing that his life is corrupt and that his living, which is outside of God, is evil. He will then rebuke himself, loathe himself, repent, and turn to God. In this way his sins will be forgiven, and he will receive the Lord&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Repent and...be baptized&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 2:38).</p>
<p>Baptism issues from a person&rsquo;s believing in the Lord Jesus and receiving His salvation. Before a person believes, he must repent. One must first repent, then believe and be baptized. Baptism is related to repentance, and it is also related to salvation because baptism is a step that should be taken after receiving salvation.</p><h2 class="head1">BELIEVING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Meaning of Believing</h2>
<p>We have already seen that there is a difference between worldly repentance and the repentance spoken of in the Bible. Similarly, man&rsquo;s definition of believing and the Bible&rsquo;s sense of believing differ from each other. Believing, as understood by man, is simply agreement or concession. Believing, according to the Bible, far exceeds this.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;As many as received Him...those who believe into His name&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:12).</p>
<p>To receive Christ is to believe into Him. To believe is to receive; it is not just to agree or confess but also to receive. One who merely agrees with the teaching that the Lord Jesus died for man to redeem man from his sins cannot be considered as having believed. Even if he admits the fact of the redemption of the Lord Jesus, he still cannot be counted as one who believes. Believing does not include just agreement and acknowledgment; rather, believing is receiving. What is agreed with and acknowledged may not necessarily be received, but what is received is definitely agreed with and acknowledged. Hence, only receiving can be counted as believing. A person must exercise his heart and spirit to receive the Lord Jesus, not only agreeing and acknowledging that He is the Savior but also receiving Him into him; this is to really believe in Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who believes has eternal life&rdquo;; &ldquo;He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life&rdquo;; &ldquo;Come to Me and drink. He who believes...&rdquo;</strong> (John 6:47, 54; 7:37-38).</p>
<p>To eat the Lord&rsquo;s flesh and drink His blood is to believe into Him. Through eating and drinking one receives all that he has eaten and drunk into his being. The Lord gave His flesh for us to eat so that we may have His life; He gave His blood for us to drink so that we may enjoy His redemption. In order to give His flesh and blood for us to eat and drink, the Lord Jesus had to die. Through death His body was broken and His blood was shed so that we may eat and drink of Him. We should exercise our spirit and heart to receive the Savior who died and bled for us, and we should also receive His redemption, which issued from His death. We should receive His Body that was broken for us so that we may have His life, and we should receive His blood that was shed for us so that we can experience the effectiveness of His redemption. By receiving Him and His redemption, we eat His flesh and drink His blood, that is, we believe into Him.</p>
<p>The Lord intends to give Himself to man in order to come into man to be his salvation. He is the bread of life to enter man so that man can have life and be filled (6:35). His life is the river of living water that enters into man to quench his thirst so that he may be satisfied forever (4:14). To believe in Him and to obtain His salvation, man must, by his spirit and heart, receive Him into himself. Simply understanding and apprehending Him with the mind or agreeing with Him and acknowledging Him with the will are inadequate. We must receive Him with our spirit in order to obtain Him. Food and water can never fill or quench our thirst if we only agree with and confess their ability to fill and quench our thirst. In order to benefit from food and water we must eat and drink. By the same token, we cannot obtain the Lord&rsquo;s salvation merely by agreeing with and acknowledging the Lord Jesus. We need to receive the Lord into us to enjoy Him as salvation. If food and water do not enter into us to mingle with us, we cannot receive the supply from them. Similarly, if the Lord Jesus does not enter into us to blend with us, we cannot obtain His salvation. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is like the supply that food and water bring to people; it is subjective and must be mingled with us. Just as we receive food and water through eating and drinking, we must receive the Lord Jesus through believing. Thus, in the Bible eating and drinking are used to illustrate our believing in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Believes into Him&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>In this verse the preposition <em>into</em> follows the word <em>believes.</em> This preposition is the same word as in Romans 6:3, which refers to being &ldquo;baptized into Christ Jesus.&rdquo; Hence, according to the original language, to believe the Lord Jesus is to believe into Him. When one is baptized, he is baptized into Christ; likewise, when one believes, he believes into Christ.</p>
<p>To believe is not just to receive but also to enter into. To receive the Lord is to receive Him into our being, allowing Him to mingle Himself with us, whereas to enter into the Lord refers to our entrance into Him to be joined to Him. One who truly believes in the Lord Jesus enters by faith into Him and becomes one with Him. To believe is not simply to have faith in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; ability to save; it is also to enter into Him by faith and to be joined to Him. For this reason the Bible speaks of a saved person as being &ldquo;in Christ&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:17). Only those who are in Christ and are joined to Christ can share in His redemption, for His death is counted as our death and the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection is reckoned as our resurrection. There is no substitution without union. Substitution is based on union. The Lord&rsquo;s death replaces our death and is counted as our death because of our oneness with Him. By faith we enter into the Lord and are joined to Him and become one with Him. Hence, His death is our death, and His resurrection is also our resurrection.</p>
<p>We must not only believe in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; ability to save us, but we must also believe into Him to be united with Him. Otherwise, we cannot share in Him and His redemption. If Noah believed that the ark could save him but failed to enter into the ark, he would not have been saved. He not only believed that the ark could save him but also entered into the ark and was joined to the ark. The experience of the ark became his experience. The ark&rsquo;s passing through the flood (typifying Christ&rsquo;s passing through death) was Noah&rsquo;s passing through the flood. When the ark emerged from the waters (typifying Christ&rsquo;s rising out of death), Noah also came out of those waters. This is how the ark saved Noah. Genuine believing causes man to obtain the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, which is to believe into the Lord and to be joined to Him. Any believing that is not a believing into is not true believing and cannot save man. One must believe into the Lord in order to participate in His redemption and to obtain the salvation that is in the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the one hand, believing is a matter of receiving, and on the other hand, it is a matter of entering into. To receive means that Christ enters into us, and to enter into means that we enter into Christ. The Bible speaks of our being in Christ as well as Christ&rsquo;s being in us (1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 2:20). Our being in Christ is our union with Christ; Christ being in us is His oneness with us. Thus, believing causes us to be joined to Christ and causes Christ to be joined with us. Genuine believing always unites the believer to Christ and Christ to the believer.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;How then shall they call upon Him into whom they have not believed?&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 10:14).</p>
<p>Genuine believing is always preceded by repentance and followed by calling. Believing without repentance beforehand is unreliable, and believing without calling afterward is ineffectual. Whether one&rsquo;s believing involves receiving and entering into depends on whether there is repentance before and calling after believing. Repentance leads man to receive the Lord, whereas calling confirms his entrance into the Lord. If a person&rsquo;s mind turns to God, his heart will surely receive the Lord, and his mouth will definitely call upon Him. This happens spontaneously. If one confesses that he believes in the Lord and yet has never called upon Him, his believing is not real believing but merely agreement or acknowledgment. These cannot save. Only those who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved (v. 13).</p>
<p>To call upon the Lord is to pray to the Lord from the spirit and the heart, asking for His forgiveness and deliverance; it is to receive the Lord and His salvation through prayer, praise, and thanks. Praying or calling upon the Lord in this way is proof that one has indeed believed into the Lord and possesses real faith.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;A great number who believed turned to the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 11:21).</p>
<p>True believing causes man to call upon the Lord. It also makes him turn to the Lord. To believe is not only to turn from sin and the world but to turn to the Lord in order to belong to the Lord. There is no real believing which does not lead man to turn to the Lord and become His. If a person truly believes in the Lord, he will spontaneously turn to the Lord and become the Lord&rsquo;s. Whether or not one&rsquo;s believing is real and proper depends on whether he has turned to the Lord and belongs to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Faith Being Given by God</h2>
<p>True repentance is a gift of God; true believing, even more so, is a gift of God.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Faith...is the gift of God&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:8).</p>
<p>Faith that leads to salvation cannot be generated by man; it is given by God. God imparts faith into man through the revelation of the Holy Spirit. When the Holy Spirit reveals the Lord Jesus and His redemption to man (Gal. 1:16), causing him to see and know the Lord Jesus and His redemption, faith is automatically generated in man. Belief in the heart is based on a vision in the spirit, and such a vision always comes from the revelation of the Holy Spirit. Without the revelation of the Holy Spirit, the human spirit cannot see, and when man&rsquo;s spirit fails to see, his heart will not believe. Faith comes from the revelation of the Holy Spirit, and it is given to man by the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s revelation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The grace of our Lord superabounded with faith&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 1:14).</p>
<p>God imparts faith into us because His grace is exceedingly abundant, not because we have any virtue or strong points. His grace is so abundant that we now possess a living faith unto salvation, even though we had sinned by rejecting Him, being unwilling and unable to believe.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Have been allotted faith equally precious as ours&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:1).</p>
<p>Since faith is a gift of God, faith is allotted and does not come from us. Peter called the faith that has been allotted to us through God&rsquo;s exceedingly abundant grace &ldquo;precious.&rdquo; Faith is precious. It enables us to believe in what we could never believe in, and when it enters into us, it is obtained once and for all and will never leave us. It is impossible for any man to believe in the mystery and centrality of the gospel of God. According to human reasoning, it is not believable that the Lord Jesus is God incarnated, was born of a virgin, died to propitiate man&rsquo;s sins, rose from the dead, ascended into the heavens, is seated at the right hand of God, and will return one day. But when this precious faith enters into our being, we can and must believe. The more we believe, the more we feel pleasant and comfortable. Once we obtain this precious faith, it can never be lost. Once we obtain this precious faith, we will never disbelieve. It is impossible for us to truly not believe, even though we may occasionally deny Him, because the precious faith given to us is in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">What to Believe In</h2>
<p>Faith has an object. We cannot pay attention simply to faith and neglect the object of faith. If the object of faith is wrong, it will be difficult for our faith to be proper. Hence, we must be clear and accurate concerning the object of faith so that we know what to believe in.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Believes into the Son&rdquo;; &ldquo;Believe into the Son of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:36; 9:35, see also v. 38).</p>
<p>God is triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the source, the Son is the expression, and the Spirit is the transmission. God who dwells in unapproachable light is the Father (1 Tim. 6:16; James 1:17); God expressed is the Son (John 1:18; Col. 1:15; Heb. 1:3); and God coming into man is the Spirit (1 John 3:24). The Son is God expressed. The expressed God is the very Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord being the Son of God means that He is the expression of God and is God expressed. He is God (John 1:1), and He is one with God (10:30). To be manifested among men He became flesh and took the form of a man to be the Son of Man (1:14; Phil. 2:6-7; Luke 19:10). Although He became the Son of Man, His expression was that of the Son of God. The Son of God is the One whom we should believe in. He alone should be the object of our faith.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 16:31).</p>
<p>We do not believe in a religion, even Christianity, nor do we believe in a certain teaching, not even a teaching about Christ. Rather, we believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, the One who is both God and man. The object of our faith is not a dead religion, that is, dead Christianity, or a dead doctrine, that is, a dead teaching concerning Christ, but the living Lord Jesus, the living Christ. Although Christ is Jesus the man, He is also the Lord and God. He is called Lord because He is God; He is called Jesus (meaning &ldquo;Jehovah the Savior&rdquo;) because He became a man. He is God and man. We believe on the Lord Jesus who is both God and man by receiving Him as our Savior through faith, thus entering into Him to be joined to Him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 20:31).</p>
<p>While <em>Christ</em> is the title of the Lord Jesus related to His office, <em>Son of God</em> is the title of His person. With reference to His office, He is the Christ of God; in relation to His person, He is the Son of God. As the Son of God, He expresses God and declares God; as the Christ of God, He came to accomplish God&rsquo;s will and to fulfill God&rsquo;s plan. We must believe that He is both the Christ of God and the Son of God. Although His name is Jesus, He is also the Christ who accomplished God&rsquo;s will and fulfilled God&rsquo;s plan. Although He became the Son of Man, He is also the Son of God who expresses and declares God. Indeed, He became Jesus to be our Savior, yet we must believe that He is the Christ who fulfilled God&rsquo;s will and completed His plan. Although He came to die for us to redeem us as the Son of Man, we must believe that He is the Son of God who expresses and declares the very God Himself. He became Jesus and the Son of Man to be our Savior so that He might deliver us, but in order to obtain His salvation and life, we must believe that He is the Christ of God and the Son of God.</p>
<p>In different times and ways the Bible repeatedly shows and leads man to believe that Jesus is the Christ of God and the Son of God (Acts 5:42; 9:22; 18:5, 28; 9:20; Rom. 1:4; Matt. 16:16; John 11:27). Satan endeavors to keep man from believing that the Lord Jesus is the Christ and the Son of God (9:22; 10:36; Matt. 26:63). If we consider that the Lord Jesus is just a man, we cannot receive salvation. Whoever thinks that Jesus is merely a son of man cannot obtain His life. We must first believe that the Lord Jesus is the Christ of God before we can obtain His salvation. This is because He accomplished God&rsquo;s redemption according to God&rsquo;s will and plan. God imparts salvation to us in Christ (Gal. 1:4; Eph. 1:5; 1 Cor. 1:30). To receive His life, we must believe that Jesus, the Son of Man, is also the Son of God because &ldquo;this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (1 John 5:11-12).</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 10:9).</p>
<p>The Bible does not require us to believe in the death of the Lord Jesus but in His resurrection. His death is acknowledged by all, yet no one can believe in His resurrection without the revelation of the Holy Spirit. His death redeemed us from our sins objectively; His resurrection imparts life into us subjectively and makes us one with Him. Without this subjective union, His objective redemption would have no impact on us. Therefore, in order to be saved, we must believe that God has raised the Lord Jesus from the dead. Without resurrection, our faith is vain, and we are still in our sins (1 Cor. 15:14, 17). For this cause, when the early apostles preached the gospel, they especially preached concerning the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, because they were witnesses of His resurrection (Acts 1:22; 2:32; 3:15; 4:33).</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Believe in the gospel&rdquo;; &ldquo;Christ died for our sins... was buried, and...has been raised&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 1:15; 1 Cor. 15:3-4).</p>
<p>Only by believing in the gospel, not in some common teaching, can a person be saved. The gospel is not a common teaching; it specifically speaks of Christ dying for our sins, being buried, and rising again. If Christ and the redemption accomplished through His death and resurrection are not the center of a teaching, it is not the gospel and cannot lead one to believe and be saved. Only the gospel that speaks of Christ and the redemption He accomplished through His death and resurrection can save people. We should believe in this gospel as the object of our faith. The Holy Spirit will reveal Christ, His death, burial, and resurrection to us in this gospel. Through this gospel we know Christ and His redemption and are led to believe in Him. To believe in Christ and His redemption is to believe the proper gospel and is the proper believing.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:10-12).</p>
<p>God gave His Son to accomplish redemption for us so that we may have eternal life. Then, by means of the Bible, He testified concerning His Son and His accomplishments. The testimony of God concerning His Son is the words in the Bible that deal with the person and work of Christ. The Lord Jesus and all that He has accomplished are in these words of witness, the Bible, for us to believe and receive. If we do not believe these words of testimony, we cannot believe in the Son of God and in the accomplishments contained in the testimony. For us to believe in the Son of God and in what He has accomplished, we must believe the words of God&rsquo;s testimony. The moment we believe in these words of witness, we obtain the Son of God and His accomplishments.</p>
<p>Believing in the Lord Jesus is not according to human imagination, presumption, and tradition but according to God&rsquo;s testimony. We do not believe in a Savior of our imagination, presumption, and tradition but in the Savior of whom God has borne testimony. Man presumes and promotes the thought that great effort must be exerted to rely on Jesus, to beseech Him for deliverance, and to look to Him for the gift of salvation, as if He has not already accomplished salvation. This is not God&rsquo;s testimony. God witnesses in His Word, the Bible, that His Son has already accomplished the work of salvation and life-impartation. The only thing that is required of man is to receive God&rsquo;s Son and His accomplishments, according to God&rsquo;s witness and words. Believing in Jesus does not require an exercise of human strength to trust and rely on Him. Rather, it is simply to receive Him and what He has accomplished by faith, according to God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>The testimony of God concerning His Son is that &ldquo;God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life&rdquo; (vv. 11-12). Man must believe this testimony to gain the Son of God and the life that is in Him.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Believed the Scripture&rdquo;</strong> (John 2:22; see also 5:46-47).</p>
<p>One who desires to believe in the Lord Jesus must believe in the Scriptures, for the Scriptures testify concerning Him (v. 39). Moreover, the Lord Jesus is the living Word of God (1:1). The Scriptures are the words written by God (2 Tim. 3:16). The living Word of God, the Lord Jesus, is the reality of the Scriptures, the written Word of God. The written Word of God, the Scriptures, is the revelation of the Lord Jesus, the living Word of God. Thus, a man cannot believe the Scriptures if he does not believe in the Lord Jesus; likewise, one who does not believe the Scriptures cannot believe in the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus and the Scriptures are inseparable. To believe in Him, one must believe the Scriptures. A &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; who does not believe the Scriptures is an unbeliever, a false Christian.</p><h2 class="head2">What Is Obtained Immediately upon Believing</h2>
<p>Once a person believes in the Lord Jesus as described above, he immediately obtains the following ten items:</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 10:43; 26:18).</p>
<p>Once we believe, God forgives all our sins, solving our problems with Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Washed&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>Once we believe, we are forgiven of our sins and even washed of them. Forgiveness spares us from the record of sin; washing eliminates the trace of sin. After being washed, our condition is as if we had never sinned or been contaminated by sins.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Sanctified&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 26:18; 1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>Once we believe, God forgives our sins and washes us. Then He sanctifies us to Himself.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Justified&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:16; see also 3:8; Rom. 3:28; 1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>Once we believe, God not only sanctifies us but also justifies us, declaring that we are righteous.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Reconciled to God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:10).</p>
<p>Once we believe, God forgives us and washes us from our sins thereby solving the problems that existed between us and Him. In so doing, He sanctifies and justifies us. Hence, the moment we believe, we are reconciled to God and are at peace with God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Begotten...of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:12-13; 1 John 5:1).</p>
<p>Forgiveness, washing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation solve the problems between us and God outwardly. However, we not only have outward problems with God, we also have inward problems related to our life and nature. Hence, once we believe, God regenerates us within. We are regenerated when we believe; that is, we are born of God.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Eternal life&rdquo;; &ldquo;Passed out of death into life&rdquo;</strong> (John 6:47; 5:24).</p>
<p>The life we receive when we are regenerated is the life of God. God&rsquo;s life is eternal; therefore, it is called eternal life. Once we believe, we experience regeneration and obtain eternal life. When we receive eternal life, we in fact pass out of death into life.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;The Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:13).</p>
<p>Once we believe, we are regenerated and obtain the life of God, and God gives us the Holy Spirit to dwell in us.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Freedom&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:1; see also John 8:36).</p>
<p>Once we believe, all our inward and outward problems are resolved, and we obtain God&rsquo;s life and the Holy Spirit. We also obtain full liberation and freedom and are no longer bound and fettered.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Saved&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:8; Acts 16:31; Luke 7:50).</p>
<p>Once we believe, we are saved, completely saved. Salvation includes a broad spectrum of things. The items listed above are given by God to us as our salvation. We obtain a complete salvation with all its riches the moment we believe. We do not need to gain anything more after believing; we only need to experience more of what we have gained.</p>
<p>These items are only briefly discussed here. Beginning in chapter 6, we will study each item separately, except for the eighth item, the Holy Spirit, which we discussed in chapter 4.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">FORGIVENESS</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will begin to see the contents of God&rsquo;s salvation. The salvation of God includes many different aspects and blessings. The first aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation is forgiveness, which is also the first blessing that a person receives upon believing. The salvation of God first solves our problems. Our foremost problem before God is our sinfulness. Thus, the first item that is taken care of in God&rsquo;s salvation is the forgiveness of sins. Before God&rsquo;s righteousness can release us, our record of sin before God must be cleared. Our sins before God must be canceled before the righteous God can come and apply other aspects of His salvation to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF FORGIVENESS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not condemned&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:18; see also 5:24).</p>
<p>The first meaning of forgiveness relates to the abolishment of our sinful record before God, which spares us from God&rsquo;s righteous judgment. We had a sinful record and were condemned before God, and we could only wait for His righteous punishment. Our record of sins demanded that we receive God&rsquo;s righteous punishment. God&rsquo;s forgiveness spared us from His righteous punishment. Now we are no longer condemned because the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood on the cross according to God&rsquo;s righteousness and thereby bore God&rsquo;s righteous judgment for us (Heb. 9:22). Since the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood to fulfill God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, God according to His righteousness, can and must forgive us of our sins, blot out our sinful record, and spare us from judgment.</p>
<p><strong>2. Sending sin away from the forgiven one.</strong></p>
<p>In the New Testament at least two different words are translated &ldquo;forgiven&rdquo; or &ldquo;forgiveness.&rdquo; One word occurs in Matthew 12:31, Romans 4:7, and 1 John 1:9. The meaning of this word in the original language is &ldquo;to cause to depart.&rdquo; The other word is in Acts 5:31, 13:38, and Ephesians 1:7, and its meaning is &ldquo;to send away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God not only forgives our sin to cancel our sinful record before Him, sparing us from His righteous judgment; He also sends away from us the sins we committed. When God caused the Lord Jesus to be our trespass offering on the cross, He put all our sins on Him so that the Lord Jesus might bear them on our behalf (John 1:29; Isa. 53:6; 1 Pet. 2:24). After God caused the Lord Jesus to be judged and punished for us by bearing our sins on the cross, our sins were forever heaped upon Satan. The type of the expiation in Leviticus 16 portrays this fact. When the high priest made expiation for the children of Israel, he took two goats and presented them before the Lord. One was killed to make expiation for the children of Israel. This goat was for God. The other, which bore the transgressions of the children of Israel, was for Azazel (vv. 7-10, 15, 22). <em>For Azazel</em> means &ldquo;for Satan&rdquo; because Azazel stands opposite to God, and only Satan stands in such a position before God.</p>
<p>Sin originated from Satan. We were deceived by him and allowed sin to come into us, causing us to have a record of sin before God. When God put all our sins on the Lord Jesus, who bore them for us and was judged for us, our record of sin was cancelled before God and our sins were returned to Satan for him to bear. In this way, God&rsquo;s forgiveness sent our sins away from us (cf. Psa. 103:12).</p>
<p>On the one hand, God forgives our sins because the Lord&rsquo;s blood eradicated our sinful record; on the other hand, His redemption dismisses our sins forever.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 31:34; Heb. 8:12).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s forgiving is also His forgetting. God&rsquo;s forgiveness of our sins not only spares us from the judgment of sin and sends our sins away, His forgiveness also results in His forgetting our sins. Once He forgave us, He removes our sins from His memory, never to remember them again.</p><h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY AND POSITION TO FORGIVE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who can forgive sins except God alone?&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 5:21).</p>
<p>Only God possesses the position and authority to forgive sins because only He has the position and authority to judge. No one other than God possesses this position and authority because man is not the lord of the universe and is sinful. Only God is the Lord of the universe and is sinless; hence, only God can judge and forgive.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 5:24).</p>
<p>Although only God possesses the authority to forgive sins, and although the Lord Jesus was a man, He was God incarnated on the earth. Therefore, He had authority on the earth to forgive sins. He is God, the Lord of the universe, and He is sinless. Hence, as God, He has the authority and position to forgive sins.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF FORGIVENESS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:22).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s forgiveness is based on the shedding of blood. Since God is righteous, He cannot forgive man&rsquo;s sins carelessly. His righteousness demands that whoever sins must die (Ezek. 18:4). If, according to His righteousness, there is no shedding of blood for a sinner, fulfilling His righteous requirement, God&rsquo;s righteousness will not permit Him to forgive sins.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;My blood...poured out for many for forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 26:28).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, died and shed His blood on the cross to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, enabling God to forgive our sins justly and legally according to His righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;In whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:7).</p>
<p>The blood of the Lord Jesus, which was shed in His death according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, satisfied the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Therefore, it has become the means by which our sins are forgiven; it is the basis of our forgiveness. Other than the Lord&rsquo;s blood, nothing, whether it is good works, virtues, zeal, or love, can be the means or the basis for the forgiveness of our sins. In this universe only the Lord&rsquo;s blood satisfies all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness upon sinners.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR SINNERS TO OBTAIN FORGIVENESS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Repentance for forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 24:47; see also Acts 5:31; Isa. 55:6-7).</p>
<p>For a sinner to be forgiven by God, he must repent, that is, change his mind to turn back to God. Formerly, he was turned away from God, and thus he sinned and offended God. If he wants God&rsquo;s forgiveness, he must turn back to God. He must &ldquo;forsake his way, and...his thoughts; and...return to Jehovah&rdquo; (v. 7).</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 10:43; see also 26:18).</p>
<p>In order for a sinner to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness, he must not only repent but also believe. Repentance, on the negative side, means to turn back to God from being away from Him. Believing, on the positive side, means to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness. Neither repenting nor believing is the basis upon which God forgives sinners; they are only the means to obtain forgiveness. Repenting and believing are not the result of an effort on the part of a sinner for which he is forgiven by God. The sinner obtains God&rsquo;s forgiveness only by the blood of the Lord Jesus. Only the Lord&rsquo;s blood causes God to give the sinner the gift of forgiveness. However, a sinner can receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness only through repenting and believing.</p>
<p>Although the blood shed by the Lord Jesus on the cross satisfied all God&rsquo;s righteous requirement upon sinners, and although God can grant sinners the gift of forgiveness because of the Lord&rsquo;s blood, a sinner cannot obtain God&rsquo;s forgiveness without repenting and believing. A sinner can receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness only through repenting and believing. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; accomplished work on the cross enables God to forgive sinners and enables sinners to receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness. A sinner does not need to do anything but repent to God and receive forgiveness from God by faith.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY FOR BELIEVERS TO OBTAIN FORGIVENESS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9; see also Psa. 32:5).</p>
<p>The way for sinners to be forgiven of their sins is to believe, and the way for believers to be forgiven of their sins is to confess. Since a believer has believed, he needs only to confess, that is, to confess his sins in order for God to forgive Him. Just as it is impossible for sinners to confess without believing, believers cannot believe without confessing. If a sinner confesses without believing, he will not obtain the peace of forgiveness, and if a believer believes and does not confess, he will not obtain restoration through forgiveness. In order for a sinner to obtain peace through forgiveness, he must believe that God forgives his sins because of the blood of the Lord Jesus. In order for a believer to obtain restoration through forgiveness, he must confess his sins and iniquities to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPHERE OF FORGIVENESS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Every sin...will be forgiven&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 12:31).</p>
<p>Every sin will be forgiven. How sweet is this sound! How wide is this sphere! The sphere of God&rsquo;s forgiveness is as wide and as large as man&rsquo;s sins. God&rsquo;s forgiveness is sufficient for the sins of man. It is sufficient to take care of all of man&rsquo;s sins. There is not one sin that the Lord Jesus has not redeemed us from on the cross. Therefore, because of the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, there is not a single sin that God will not forgive. (Blaspheming the Holy Spirit is a specific sin and is not likely to be committed today.)</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Having forgiven us all our offenses&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:13).</p>
<p>God and all that He has are complete. Hence, His forgiveness is also complete. He is never incomplete in His doings. He will never grant us an incomplete forgiveness, a partial forgiveness. He will not forgive some of our sins and leave other sins unforgiven. Once He forgives, He forgives all our sins, all our offenses.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF FORGIVENESS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;But with You there is forgiveness, / That You would be feared&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 130:4).</p>
<p>Man thinks that God&rsquo;s forgiveness will result in man being audacious and loose, not realizing that God&rsquo;s forgiveness results in His being feared. Our experience tells us that the more we are forgiven by God, the more we fear God; the more we receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness, the more fear we have toward God. Only those who have never been forgiven by God or tasted His forgiveness are audacious, loose, and free. Once a person tastes God&rsquo;s forgiving grace, fear is immediately born in him, together with a hatred of sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Her sins which are many are forgiven, because she loved much&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 7:47, see also vv. 42-43).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s forgiving grace not only causes man to fear Him but even more to love Him. Negatively, fear prevents one from doing what does not please God. Positively, love causes one to do what pleases God. Therefore, God&rsquo;s forgiveness not only causes people to fear Him and to not sin, but it also causes people to love Him and please Him. The sinful woman recorded in Luke 7, who obtained the Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness, did not go back to sin but instead showed her love to the Lord with all that she had and all that she was. God&rsquo;s forgiving grace can deliver man from all the sins that the law with its condemnation cannot deliver man from. The condemnation of Mount Sinai caused man to fear God and stay away from Him; the forgiveness of Golgotha causes man to love God and draw near to Him. The more a person has been forgiven by God, the more he loves God. The sinful woman had much love for the Lord because she obtained much forgiveness from the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness causes man to love Him.</p><h2 class="head1">DIFFERENT KINDS OF FORGIVENESS</h2>
<p>There are different kinds of forgiveness in the Bible. If we confuse them with one another, we will be perplexed and unable to understand the truth concerning forgiveness in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Eternal Forgiveness</h2>
<p>The first kind of forgiveness is God&rsquo;s eternal forgiveness. This forgiveness concerns the eternal salvation of man. Although this forgiveness is eternal, it is granted to sinners in this age. The Bible refers mainly to this kind of forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Through His blood&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:7; see also Heb. 9:22; Matt. 26:28).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal forgiveness is given to sinners because of the blood that Christ shed on the cross. The blood of Christ enables the sinner to receive God&rsquo;s eternal forgiveness and obtain eternal salvation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;By faith&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 26:18; see also 10:43).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s eternal forgiveness to sinners is not only because of the blood of Christ but also because of the sinner&rsquo;s believing. Once a sinner believes in what Christ&rsquo;s blood has accomplished for him according to what God has said, he receives God&rsquo;s eternal forgiveness in this age, which causes him to be eternally saved, never to perish.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Forgiveness for the Restoration of Fellowship</h2>
<p>The second kind of forgiveness is the forgiveness through which God restores fellowship with the believer. Such forgiveness concerns only the matter of fellowship between a believer and God, not his eternal salvation. Since it is related to the fellowship between a believer and God, this forgiveness is given to a believer in this age.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;By the blood of Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>The forgiveness through which God restores fellowship with a believer is also granted because of the Lord&rsquo;s blood. The Lord&rsquo;s blood not only enables one to obtain God&rsquo;s eternal forgiveness at the time he believes but also enables him to continuously receive the forgiveness that restores his fellowship with God after believing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If we confess&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>A sinner obtains God&rsquo;s eternal forgiveness by believing. A believer obtains God&rsquo;s fellowship-restoring forgiveness by confessing. Once a sinner obtains God&rsquo;s eternal forgiveness through believing, he is saved and has a spiritual fellowship of life with God. As a result, he feels light and happy within. But when he sins, he feels painful and weighed down because his fellowship with God is broken. Although sinning does not cause him to perish eternally and cannot sever his life relationship with God, it causes pain and heaviness within because his fellowship with God has been broken. To relieve his inner pain, remove the heaviness on his heart, and restore his fellowship with God, the believer must confess his sins before God in order to obtain God&rsquo;s forgiveness. This matter is particularly spoken of in 1 John 1.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Disciplinary Forgiveness</h2>
<p>The third kind of forgiveness is God&rsquo;s disciplinary forgiveness. This forgiveness concerns God&rsquo;s way of disciplining His children in this age and is exercised in this age.</p>
<p><strong>1. Through chastisement in this age</strong> (James 5:14-15; 2 Sam. 12:9-15; cf. Gal. 6:7-8; 2 Sam. 22:26-27; 1 Pet. 5:5-6).</p>
<p>Some sins committed by God&rsquo;s children are concluded without any painful consequences after they are confessed and forgiven. However, some sins result in painful discipline even after they are confessed to God and forgiven. David is the clearest example of forgiveness accompanied by discipline. Although he was a man according to God&rsquo;s heart and was loved by God, he committed a gross sin; that is, David murdered Uriah and took his wife. Although he was rebuked by God, confessed his sin to God, and was forgiven by God, discipline still followed forgiveness. God forgave the sin yet raised up an environment that dealt with him severely. David killed one, and God caused four members of his family to die, even as David himself once spoke, saying, &ldquo;Restore...fourfold&rdquo; (2 Sam. 12:6). He committed adultery with Uriah&rsquo;s wife, and God allowed fornication in his household. He murdered Uriah, and God permitted his sons to rebel against him and seek his life. &ldquo;Whatever a man sows, this he will also reap&rdquo; (Gal. 6:7).</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s sins not only create a sinful record before God but also cause him to suffer the consequences of sin. The sins that a person commits might be forgiven by God, but he might not be spared from the sufferings that result from them. If a child continually goes against his mother&rsquo;s wishes and steals candy, his stealing may be pardoned by his mother, but this will not eliminate the cavities in his teeth caused by the sweets. Although the sins committed by God&rsquo;s children are forgiven by God, discipline often follows, whether it is sickness, family tragedies, business setbacks, or loss of material possessions. When believers encounter the discipline that follows forgiveness, they should follow the example of David to prostrate and humble themselves &ldquo;under the mighty hand of God&rdquo; that &ldquo;in due time&rdquo; God may deliver them from suffering His discipline (1 Pet. 5:6).</p><h2 class="head2">Forgiveness in the Kingdom</h2>
<p>The fourth kind of forgiveness is the forgiveness in the kingdom, which concerns God&rsquo;s punishment of the believers in the millennium and will be exercised in the coming age.</p>
<p><strong>1. Through the punishment in the coming age</strong> (Matt. 18:34, see also vv. 21-35).</p>
<p>The words spoken by the Lord, &ldquo;It will not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the one to come&rdquo; (12:32), prove that some sins are forgiven in this age and some in the age to come, that is, in the millennium. In Matthew 18 the Lord spoke of a believer who did not forgive from the heart his brother who had offended him. When the Lord comes to judge the believers, that is, &ldquo;to settle accounts with his slaves&rdquo; (v. 23), He will deliver such a one &ldquo;to the torturers,&rdquo; that is, He will cause him to be punished in the millennium until he forgives his brother from his heart (vv. 34-35). This shows that some believers&rsquo; sins will be forgiven only after punishment in the millennium. If a believer sins after being saved, he can be forgiven and chastised by God for some sins in this age, that is, today. But some sins can be forgiven only after the believer is punished in the millennium. (Details of the millennium punishment are covered in chapter 48.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Forgiveness Exercised by the Church</h2>
<p>The fifth kind of forgiveness is the forgiveness exercised by the church. This forgiveness, which concerns the fellowship of God&rsquo;s children, is exercised when the church receives newly saved believers or sinful but repenting believers, according to the speaking of the Lord in Matthew 16:19 and 18:15-18. In these two portions of the Word, the Lord clearly shows that the church may loose people on the earth, that is, forgive them. This does not mean that the church may loose and forgive those whom God has not loosed and forgiven, which is a heretical teaching of Catholicism. The church&rsquo;s loosing and forgiving on the earth are based on God&rsquo;s loosing and forgiving in heaven. The church can only loose and forgive those on the earth whom God has loosed and forgiven in heaven. The church&rsquo;s loosing and forgiving on the earth are simply a declaration of God&rsquo;s loosing and forgiving in heaven. Furthermore, the Lord&rsquo;s words show that the authority of the church to loose and forgive on the earth was given not just to Peter, as advocated by the Catholic teaching that says only the pope has the authority to forgive on the earth because he is the successor to Peter. Rather, this authority was given also to the church. Just as Peter had this authority (ch. 16), the church has this authority (ch. 18).</p>
<p><strong>1. By the power of the Holy Spirit</strong> (John 20:22-23).</p>
<p>In the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples in order for them to receive the Holy Spirit, and then said, &ldquo;Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven them&rdquo; (v. 23). This shows that the church forgives people&rsquo;s sins; that is, the church decides whether a person&rsquo;s sin has been forgiven by God by the power of the Holy Spirit who indwells the believers (the church). The church may not forgive a person&rsquo;s sins according to its own opinion. It must follow the inner leading of the Holy Spirit; otherwise, the one whom the church has forgiven on the earth will not be one whom God has forgiven in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Confirm your love&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 2:5-11; see also 1 Cor. 5:1-2, 11-13).</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of forgiving a person, the church should be strict but should also exercise adequate love. The church must deal with, condemn, and even remove a sinful brother who is unwilling to repent (v. 13). But once he repents, the church should confirm its love toward him, and forgive and receive him. Otherwise, Satan will utilize this opportunity to damage a repenting brother, who has been removed by the church, thus damaging the church.</p><h2 class="head2">Personal Forgiveness of the Believer</h2>
<p>The sixth kind of forgiveness is the personal forgiveness of the believer. This is the believer&rsquo;s forgiving of others today and it is related to escaping future punishment in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>1. That we ourselves may be forgiven</strong> (Matt. 6:12, 14-15; 18:21-35; Mark 11:25-26; Luke 6:37; Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:13).</p>
<p>Conflicts easily arise when people spend time with one another. After believers are together for a while, there will be wrongdoings and mutual offenses. Thus, the Lord wants us to forgive and pardon one another. Since the Lord knows that it is easy for us to offend others and difficult for us to forgive others, He often spoke in the Bible of forgiving those who offend us. In His teaching, He used not only plain words but even illustrations of how God has forgiven us. He also spoke of the punishment in the millennial kingdom to warn us to take heed to the matter of forgiving others. This may be a small thing in our eyes, but it is a big thing in God&rsquo;s eyes. He spoke seriously both of pleasing God today by forgiving others and of not escaping punishment in the kingdom if we do not forgive others.</p>
<p>Since a believer has been forgiven by God and possesses God&rsquo;s life, he should forgive those who offend him, according to God&rsquo;s forgiving grace as well as His life and nature. However, some do not like to forgive others and have a hard time forgiving others. Although some brothers and sisters say that they have forgiven those who have offended them, they do not forget the offenses as God does when He forgives. Charles Spurgeon once said that the forgiveness of some is like burying a dead dog but leaving its tail above the ground. Although we may have forgiven someone, we still remember his wrongdoing, and we even tell others about the offense. We continually recount the matter with all its details and speak of how we have forgiven him. This is not forgiveness from the heart. In God&rsquo;s eyes, this is not forgiveness at all.</p>
<p>Failure to forgive others will not cause believers to perish eternally, but it may cause them to be punished in the millennial kingdom. If we do not forgive others today, the Lord will not forgive us in the coming kingdom until we forgive them from our heart. To escape such punishment in the coming kingdom, we must forgive others from the heart today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">CLEANSING</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the matter of cleansing. The Bible reveals that cleansing is a blessing in God&rsquo;s salvation that immediately follows forgiveness. God not only forgives us but also cleanses us. Forgiveness cancels the punishment of sin, and cleansing erases the trace of sin. When God forgives us, He spares us from the accountability that is related to sin. Then He cleanses us as if we had never sinned. This is similar to a friend paying all our debts. Although we are now exempt from the responsibility of the debts, the trace of the debts may still be in our record. If the trace of the debts is obliterated, it will be as if we were never in debt. This is God&rsquo;s salvation to us. After He forgives us, He cleanses us, and it is as if we never sinned before Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF CLEANSING</h2>
<p>Man&rsquo;s sin has not only made him a sinner with a record of sin before God, but it has also defiled and dirtied him. Thus, man needs not only forgiveness but also cleansing.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who can say, I have made my heart clean; / I am pure from my sin?&rdquo;</strong> (Prov. 20:9).</p>
<p>The heart of man is filthy, full of sin and evil. Who has a pure and sinless heart? There is no one whose heart is pure and sinless. Furthermore, there is no one who cleanses his own heart and purifies himself from his sin after his heart has been defiled by sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;How then can a man...be pure?...How much less a man, a maggot...a worm!&rdquo;; &ldquo;How much less a man who drinks wrong like water!&rdquo;</strong> (Job 25:4-6; 15:16; see also 14:4).</p>
<p>All the people in the world are born of the flesh and are therefore filthy and abominable. They love sin, they drink wrong like water, and they are like worms existing in filthiness. How can such people be counted as clean before God without facing the requirement to be cleansed?</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:19).</p>
<p>All the members of a man&rsquo;s body have become slaves to uncleanness and are defiled. If a man were to thoroughly inspect all the members of his body, would any part not be a slave to uncleanness or not be defiled by sin?</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;I am a man of unclean lips, / And in the midst of a people of unclean lips I dwell&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 6:5).</p>
<p>The filthiest part of man is his lips. Whose lips are clean? Whose lips have not been contaminated by cursing, slander, criticism, lies, obscenity, or babblings? Who has kept his lips clean for even one day without being polluted by unclean words?</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;All these wicked things proceed from within and defile the man&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 7:23).</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s mouth is defiled because his heart is defiled. &ldquo;For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks&rdquo; (Matt. 12:34). Since man&rsquo;s heart is full of all kinds of defilement, filthy and defiling things proceed from his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;In the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:24).</p>
<p>Man not only has a heart that is full of defilement and a mouth that speaks filthiness; he also works uncleanness. Just as the heart and mouth of man are filthy, so is his behavior. Who has clean hands? Whose feet are not dirty? We know the unclean things that our hands have done and the filthy ways that our feet have walked!</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;For all of us became like him who is unclean, / And all our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 64:6).</p>
<p>All are unclean before God, and all that comes from man is defiled. In God&rsquo;s eyes not only the things that man deems evil and corrupt are unclean, but even matters that man considers good and righteous are filthy before God. All man&rsquo;s righteousnesses are like a soiled garment before God.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;They have all turned aside; / They are together perverse&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 14:3).</p>
<p>All men have turned aside from God&rsquo;s way and have become perverse.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Yet to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 1:15).</p>
<p>Man has fallen into filthiness. Before he believes in the Lord, nothing is pure. What can be pure when man himself is defiled? &ldquo;Who can bring a clean thing out from the unclean?&rdquo; (Job 14:4).</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;The leper...shall...cry, Unclean, unclean!&rdquo;</strong> (Lev. 13:45).</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s filthy and unclean condition before God is like that of a leper. Man is totally filthy and desperately needs cleansing.</p><h2 class="head1">CLEANSING AT THE TIME OF REDEMPTION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s cleansing can be divided into several stages. One stage of cleansing occurred when the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, another takes place when we are saved, and still another occurs after our salvation.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, He completed the work of cleansing. On the cross the Lord Jesus finished a perfect cleansing on our behalf and placed it before God. Such a cleansing can be applied to us at any time.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Purified by blood&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:22).</p>
<p>Since the filthiness of the universe and man came from sin, it can be cleansed only by the redeeming blood. There must first be the shedding of blood for redemption and then the cleansing of the filthiness from sin. Since the Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to accomplish redemption, His blood cleanses away all man&rsquo;s defilement that results from sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who...having made purification of sins, sat down...on high&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 1:3; see also Lev. 16:15-17, 30).</p>
<p>After the Lord Jesus shed His blood on the cross to accomplish the cleansing of man&rsquo;s sins, He sat down at the right hand of God on high. He shed His blood once and accomplished an eternal cleansing. According to the typology in Leviticus 16, He brought His own blood into the Holy of Holies in the heavenlies and sprinkled it before God (Heb. 12:22, 24) to make propitiation for our sins so that we might be cleansed and &ldquo;from all...sins...be clean&rdquo; before God (Lev. 16:30).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CLEANSING AT THE TIME OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>The cleansing we experienced when we were saved is the very cleansing that the Lord Jesus accomplished and that God applied to us. The cleansing accomplished by the Lord on the cross is an objective fact before God; at the time of our salvation it becomes a subjective experience to us.</p>
<p>The cleansing we received at the time of our salvation has three aspects. The first aspect is the cleansing of the blood, the second is the cleansing of life, and the third is the cleansing of baptism. We obtain this threefold cleansing once we believe and are baptized and saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Cleansing of the Blood</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s blood is a fountain for sin (Zech. 13:1) that cleanses us at the time we are saved. Comparatively speaking, this aspect of the cleansing of the blood is outward, objective, and stresses what occurs before God. Although the Lord&rsquo;s blood also cleanses our conscience, this cleansing is surely not as subjective and inward as the cleansing by the Lord&rsquo;s life. Furthermore, though the Lord&rsquo;s blood cleanses our conscience within, the cleansing is for our standing before God.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who...has released us from our sins by His blood&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:5).</p>
<p>Once we believe that the Lord died and shed His blood on the cross to make propitiaton for sins, the Lord&rsquo;s blood causes God to forgive us of our sins and to spare us from the punishment of sin; it also washes away our sins and removes the filthiness of sin from us.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Washed...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>To be in the name of the Lord is to be one with Him. When we become one with the Lord by faith, His name causes us to share in the cleansing of His redeeming blood. The Lord&rsquo;s blood cleanses us because we have believed in His name and are one with Him. Once we believe in the name of the Lord and are one with Him, His blood cleanses us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;How much more will the blood of Christ...purify our conscience&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:14).</p>
<p>Many people say that the Lord&rsquo;s blood cleansed their hearts. This is wrong and not according to the Bible. According to the Bible, the Lord&rsquo;s blood does not purify our heart; rather, it purifies our conscience. In God&rsquo;s way of salvation, God cleanses our conscience, not our heart, with the Lord&rsquo;s blood. Our conscience is the most vital part of our spirit, and our spirit is the very faculty with which we contact God. It is the conscience in our spirit that allows us to hear God and to know His intention. However, our conscience was defiled and lost its function because of our sins. When we were saved, God cleansed our sin-defiled conscience with the Lord&rsquo;s redeeming blood, making it clean and transparent and recovering its original function so that we may serve God according to our purified conscience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the conscience in us also represents God, especially the law of God; it reflects God and His law. Whatever God condemns according to His law, the conscience reflects and condemns. Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood satisfied God and the requirements of His law, washing away our sins so that God and His law no longer condemn us, our conscience, which represents God and His law within us, will not condemn us. Just as our sins are cleansed before God and His law, they are also cleansed before our conscience. Consequently, our conscience enables us to serve God with boldness.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cleansing of Life</h2>
<p>We are not only filthy in our conduct before God, but our nature is also defiled. Our outward behavior is filthy, and our inward nature is defiled. Thus, there is not only the aspect of the blood but also the aspect of life in the cleansing that God has prepared for us in His salvation. The aspect of the blood stresses the removal of the filthiness in our <em>behavior</em> before God, His law, and our conscience; the aspect of life stresses the removal of defilement in our <em>nature.</em> Therefore, the cleansing of life is absolutely subjective and inward.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The washing of regeneration&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:5).</p>
<p>Regeneration is a washing. However, this washing does not cleanse our defiled nature, because regeneration does not change our corrupt nature. The washing of regeneration means that we obtain God&rsquo;s life and nature in addition to our original life and nature and that God&rsquo;s life and nature deliver us from our own life and nature and, thus, from the filthiness that belongs to our life and nature. Our original life and nature were defiled when Adam first sinned. Our original life and nature are not only filthy but filthiness itself. To be in our life and nature is to be in filthiness. Since regeneration causes us to obtain God&rsquo;s life and nature and to be delivered from our filthy life and nature, it also delivers us from filthiness itself. Thus, regeneration is a washing of our being, a very subjective washing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Cleansing their hearts by faith&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 15:9).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s saving way, He does not cleanse our heart by the Lord&rsquo;s redeeming blood. Rather, He purifies our heart with His Spirit of life because of our union with the Lord by faith. That is, He replaces our old stony heart, which is incurable and full of various kinds of defilement (Jer. 17:9; Matt. 15:18-20), with a pure and pliable new heart (Ezek. 36:26). Thus, He causes us to be cleansed in our hearts.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Purified your souls by your obedience to the truth&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:22).</p>
<p>Our soul, that is, our self, our person, includes our mind, emotion, and will. Originally, because of our rebellion against God, every part of our soul, whether the mind, the emotion, or the will, was defiled. After repenting and returning to God, our souls are purified through our obedience to God&rsquo;s truth by faith. This means that the Holy Spirit, as the living water in us, cleanses every part of our soul with God&rsquo;s truth and God&rsquo;s life, eliminating all that opposes God, all that rejects God, and all that is not for God, according to God, from God, or of God. Thus, our entire soul, our whole person, is cleansed.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:3).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word cleanses us like water. When we were sinners, there were improper things in every part of our being, and there was filthiness that was opposed to God. Some things were of sin, some were of the world, and some were of fleshly lusts. All these things were displeasing to God. When we believed, the Lord removed these things from our being through His word so that we might be clean.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Washed...in the Spirit of our God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>The washing of regeneration, the purification of our hearts by faith, the purification of our soul by the truth, and the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s word are all accomplished by the Spirit of God in us. Through God&rsquo;s truth and the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Holy Spirit does the work of cleansing in all the parts of our being by God&rsquo;s life, delivering us from all filthiness and making us clean, based on our faith and obedience.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 2:14).</p>
<p>God cleanses us by His word through His truth and with His Spirit and life to make us a particular people as His unique possession. Originally, we were worldly people, following the same course of uncleanness. Then God separated us from the filthy heap of the world by His purifying work, delivering us from worldly lusts, sin, and corruption with all its filth, and making us distinct and special to be His pure people for His unique possession in the polluted world.</p>
<p>God cleanses us not only with the blood but also with life. The blood washes away all our ungodly and unrighteous defilement before God through its effectiveness in making propitiation. Life causes us to put off the old creation with its filthiness through life&rsquo;s resurrection power. In typology, the cleansing of the leper in the Old Testament reveals these two aspects of cleansing (Lev. 14:1-20; Matt. 8:2-4). Sprinkling and putting the blood on the leper speak of the cleansing by the propitiating blood; the healing of leprosy illustrates the cleansing of life. The defilement of sin upon us is like leprosy on a man&rsquo;s body; it corrupts and defiles our nature and causes us to be unclean and condemned before God. God&rsquo;s way of salvation is to make propitiation for our sins by the Lord&rsquo;s blood in order to remove our uncleanness before Him and to work in us by His life to cleanse us from our corrupt nature and its filthiness.</p><h2 class="head2">The Cleansing of Baptism</h2>
<p>The filthiness of our sins was not only before God and within us but also before men. Many of our ungodly and unrighteous acts against God were committed before men, and many of our sinful, evil, lewd, and filthy deeds were known to those around us. Thus, when we believe and are saved, God also, through a particular means, cleanses away the dirtiness of our sin in the eyes of men and before men. This is the cleansing of baptism. Baptism is a silent declaration of our repentance to God. Through baptism we announce the facts of our repentance and believing and of our deliverance from the filthiness of sin before all those around us. This separates us from our sinful defilement in their eyes, and we become repentant, rectified, and cleansed people before them.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Rise up and be baptized and wash away your sins&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 22:16).</p>
<p>These words were spoken by Ananias, who was sent by God to Saul after Saul met the Lord on his way to Damascus. Saul&mdash;later named Paul&mdash;opposed the Lord, persecuted the church, and harmed the Christians. These actions were well known to all, especially to the Christians. After he met the Lord and repented to Him, he needed to be baptized so that all could realize that such an opposer of the Lord and a persecutor of the church had turned to the Lord to become a Christian. This washed away the sins of opposition and persecution from Paul in the sight of men.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CLEANSING AFTER BEING SAVED</h2>
<p>Although we were fully cleansed by God at the time of our salvation, we still need to be cleansed after being saved because we are still living in the old creation, our body is not yet redeemed, and we still fall and sin. On the one hand, we need the Lord&rsquo;s life to deliver us from the life in the old creation until our body is redeemed and the new creation swallows up all of the old creation. On the other hand, we need the Lord&rsquo;s blood to cleanse away our trespasses instantly to restore our cleanness before God.</p>
<p>At the time of our salvation, God first washed away our sins by the Lord&rsquo;s blood so that His life might enter into us to do its work of cleansing to deliver us from the life of the old creation. If the Lord&rsquo;s blood had not cleansed us, His life would not have been able to enter into us. Therefore, when we are saved, the cleansing of the blood precedes the cleansing of life. However, after we are saved, the cleansing of life becomes primary and the cleansing of the blood supplementary. After we are saved, the major goal of God&rsquo;s cleansing is to deliver us from the old creation by His life within us until we are completely transformed into a new creation. Since we often fail and sin in the process, God still cleanses us moment by moment by the Lord&rsquo;s blood and with His life so that the working of His life in us may not be disrupted.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Aspect of Life</h2>
<p>From the time we were saved, the Holy Spirit has been moving and operating in us by the Lord&rsquo;s life, causing us to put off all that is of man and not of God and all that is not in agreement with God, until we arrive at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ through the operation of the Lord&rsquo;s life (Eph. 4:13).</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 5:26-27).</p>
<p>Here <em>word</em> refers to the Lord&rsquo;s word. <em>The water in the word</em> refers to the life that is in the Lord&rsquo;s word (John 6:63). Like water, this life has the power to cleanse. The Lord is cleansing the church by the washing of this life-water in the word, freeing her from everything natural, everything of the old creation, every spot and wrinkle of man, and every blemish of the old creation so that she may become holy and glorious, filled with Christ&rsquo;s divine holiness and expressing the glory of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 7:1).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s cleansing of the believer by the Lord&rsquo;s life purifies the believer not only from the filthiness of the flesh without but also from any filthiness of the spirit within. The believer should put off all filthiness without and within by following the moving of the Spirit and obeying the sense of life so that he may be increasingly purified.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Purifies himself, even as He is pure&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:3).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit, through the Lord&rsquo;s life, will cleanse the believer until he is as pure as the Lord. Therefore, a believer should obey the Holy Spirit and put away by the Spirit all matters that do not agree with or match the Lord, until he is pure even as the Lord is pure.</p><h2 class="head2">In the Aspect of the Blood</h2>
<p>Although we are saved and cleansed by God and although we have the Spirit of God and the life of the Lord leading us to live a holy life and walk in a pure pathway, we often fall, fail, sin, and become defiled. For this reason God continues to wash us instantly with the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from every sin&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:7).</p>
<p>From the moment of our salvation until the redemption of our bodies, the Lord&rsquo;s blood cleanses us from our sins continually to restore the cleanness that we obtained when we were saved. In the original language, <em>cleanses</em> means a constant and continual cleansing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>If we are defiled by sin&mdash;unrighteousness&mdash;after our salvation, we must confess our sins to God, who will forgive us and restore our cleanness.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 7:14; see also 22:14).</p>
<p><em>Robes</em> refers to the works of the saints after their salvation (19:8). Although our works may be contaminated by sin after we are saved, we can wash them and make them white by the Lord&rsquo;s blood. We must confess our sins to God instantly at all times to seek His cleansing (cf. Psa. 51:2, 7).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RESULT OF CLEANSING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;They will be as white as snow... / They will be like wool&rdquo;</strong> (Isa. 1:18).</p>
<p>The result of God&rsquo;s cleansing us is that we become as white as snow and like wool. The whiteness of both snow and wool is natural. This shows that the result of God&rsquo;s cleansing is to make us not only white but even naturally white, as if we had never been defiled.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Whiter than snow&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 51:7).</p>
<p>The result of God&rsquo;s cleansing makes us not only as white as snow but even whiter than snow. How pure and white this is! Hallelujah!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">SANCTIFICATION</h1>
<p>Sanctification is an important part in God&rsquo;s salvation. The Scriptures speak quite clearly concerning the matter of sanctification. Regrettably, while many today pay attention to the teaching of sanctification, they misunderstand its meaning. We need to return to the Bible to see the truth concerning sanctification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;SEPARATION&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Sanctify&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:19; Exo. 28:3, 41; Lev. 22:2; Isa. 66:17; see also John 10:36).</p>
<p>Many consider that being sanctified means to cast off all sins and to be cleansed of all filthiness. But this is not the proper concept of sanctification according to God&rsquo;s Word. God&rsquo;s thought concerning sanctification greatly exceeds this concept. In fact, a person who has cast off all sins and is purged of all evil still might not be sanctified before God.</p>
<p>Both in the Old Testament Hebrew and in the New Testament Greek, the emphasis in the meaning of <em>sanctification</em> is separation. According to the Old and New Testaments, sanctification refers to separation. The meaning of <em>sanctification</em> in the Bible is to be separated from common things.</p>
<p>The Bible shows that holiness is God&rsquo;s nature and essence. God&rsquo;s nature and essence are distinct from everything. Whenever God or godly matters are spoken of in the Bible, they are referred to as being holy. An object that is not consecrated to God or that does not belong to God is not holy; once it is consecrated to God and belongs to God, however, it is holy and separated. For example, a bullock or a goat is not holy, but it becomes sanctified once it is laid on the altar because the altar separates it unto God (Matt. 23:19). Gold is not holy, but it becomes sanctified once it is put in the temple because the temple separates it unto God (v. 17). Food is not holy, yet it is sanctified by the prayer of the saints because the prayer separates it for the saints of God. Animals, gold, and food are in the world, belong to the world, and are for the world; hence, they are common rather than holy. The altar sets apart some bulls and goats, the temple sets apart some gold, and the prayers of the saints set apart some food. These things become sanctified and holy because they have been separated unto God to be directly or indirectly for God. Sanctifying these objects does not make them sinless; it separates them unto God. Do bulls and goats, gold, and food sin? Do they need to be delivered from sin? Their problem is not related to sin but to the world. Although they are not evil, they are common. They are of the world and for the world; they do not belong to God and are not for God. They are common and ordinary; they are not separated or consecrated to God to be holy. Therefore, they need to be sanctified; they need the experience of being separated unto God and being for God. Thus, to be sanctified is to be separated not only from sin but also from the world and all that is worldly, from all that is not of God and not for God, to be consecrated to God so that the sanctified one may match God&rsquo;s holy nature and essence.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Make a distinction between the holy and the common&rdquo;</strong> (Lev. 10:10; see also Ezek. 22:26; 44:23).</p>
<p>These verses show that the opposite of &ldquo;holy&rdquo; is not sin but that which is &ldquo;common.&rdquo; Sanctification involves separation from what is common to be holy. To be common means to be ordinary, not necessarily sinful or wrong. A thing does not need to be sinful or wrong to be unholy. It is unholy because it is not separated from what is common. A person may behave very properly and uprightly and appear blameless and perfect before men, but he is still common rather than holy. Although he is proper and upright, he is common and ordinary because he has not been separated from what is common and ordinary to be consecrated to God. Although he may not be defiled, he goes along with the tide of the age and what is common. Thus, even though he may be proper and upright, he still needs to be sanctified. Sanctification separates people not only from evil defilement but also from what is common so that they may be holy.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Consecrates...to be holy to Jehovah&rdquo;</strong> (Lev. 27:14; see also 22:3; Exo. 13:2; 39:30).</p>
<p>Negatively, to be sanctified means to be separated from all that is apart from God; positively, it means to be consecrated to God. All that is outside of God is common; only God and what is of God are holy. All persons, things, and matters are outside of God and are worldly; therefore, they are common. Sanctification separates these common persons, things, and matters from all that is apart from God so that they may be consecrated to God and belong to God. Not only do they need to be separated from what is apart from God, but they also need to be consecrated to belong to God, for only God is holy, and only what is consecrated and belongs to God is sanctified.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE OF SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
CHRIST</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Christ Jesus, who became...to us from God... sanctification&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>God has made Christ our sanctification. This shows that holiness is just Christ. Christ entered into us to be our life at the time of our salvation. This life, which is sanctification, causes us to have God&rsquo;s holy nature so that we may be holy and live a life of holiness.</p>
<p>After we are saved, Christ indwells us, and His holy life in us, which is Himself, causes us to be different from worldly people and to be separated from the world. After we pray and spend time with the Lord, His life causes us to be different from our colleagues and schoolmates. While they spend their time in amusements and recreation, something mysterious within tells us to leave and not be with them. If we follow them, we will feel unhappy even if they are having fun. This mysterious thing is the Lord&rsquo;s life. This life is holiness, and being holy is according to its taste. This life loves all that agrees with God&rsquo;s holy nature and abhors all that is contrary to God&rsquo;s holy nature. Hence, if we touch what God loves and what is in accord with His holy nature, He gives us a comfortable and marvelous inward sensation; but if we contact what God hates and what opposes His holy nature, He causes us to feel grief and pain inwardly. In this way God causes us to put off all that does not agree with His holy nature so that we may live in this nature to be holy.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, in God&rsquo;s way of salvation there are no laws and regulations charging us how to conduct ourselves and how to dress. In God&rsquo;s salvation there is only a precious life, which is Christ, whose nature matches God&rsquo;s holiness and whose very taste is God&rsquo;s holiness. This life moves in us to do the work of separation according to its taste which is one with God&rsquo;s holy nature. This causes us to be different from the world in conduct and appearance until we are full of God&rsquo;s holy nature and completely live out God&rsquo;s holy life to become perfectly holy.</p>
<p>Therefore, Christ is our life of sanctification within, causing us to live out God&rsquo;s holiness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIGHT OF SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Sanctify them in the truth&rdquo;</strong> (John 17:17, see also v. 19).</p>
<p>In order that we may be sanctified, God not only gives us life within but also the Bible without. The Bible is the word of God, and the word of God is truth. The life of Christ causes us to possess a holy nature and taste. The truth of the Bible acts as our holy enlightenment and guidance. The life within requires us to be holy, whereas the truth without teaches us to be holy. The holy nature within corresponds with the holy light without, and the holy guidance without activates the holy taste within. These two complement each other. The more we follow the sensation of holiness within, the more we will see the revelation of holiness without. The more we read the Bible without, the more the life is strengthened within. The truth in the Bible, like the inner taste of life, separates us from worldly people. If we read the Bible often, the truth in it will enlighten and show us what agrees with God&rsquo;s holy nature and what is contrary to it. This will separate us and our manner of living from the world so that we may be holy and be in agreement with the holy nature in us. Thus, others will sense God, or holiness, in us and in our manner of life. If we truly read the Bible, we will see that only God is holy and that whatever is not of God, whatever is not out of God, and whatever does not cause people to sense God are common and unholy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF SANCTIFICATION&mdash;<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 15:16; see also 1 Pet. 1:2; 1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>In addition to giving Christ to us as our sanctifying life within and the Bible as our sanctifying light without, God gives us the Holy Spirit as our sanctifying power for our sanctification. The Holy Spirit strengthens the requirement of the holy life within us and makes the light of the holy truth outside of us to shine brighter. He also enables us to answer the demand of the holy life within and to obey the shining of the holy truth without. These three&mdash;the life of Christ, the light of the Bible, and the power of the Spirit&mdash;are like a threefold cord, sanctifying us completely.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Sanctification of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 2:13).</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit always inspires us according to the sense of life and the light of the Word, making us one with God&rsquo;s holy nature. Through His life, He causes us to sense, and through the Bible, He causes us to see what does and does not agree with God. This enables us to live according to God&rsquo;s nature, which is to live in God&rsquo;s nature and become holy.</p><h2 class="head1">POSITIONAL SANCTIFICATION&mdash;PAST</h2>
<p>The sanctification that we obtain in God&rsquo;s salvation may be divided into two aspects&mdash;positional and experiential. Positional sanctification is the fact of sanctification that we obtained in Christ when we believed. Although we may not have the experience of sanctification, we obtained the fact of sanctification in Christ when we believed; that is, we gained the position of sanctification.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:14, see also v. 10).</p>
<p>When Christ gave His body on the cross as a sin offering to redeem us and to sanctify us, He sanctified us forever. Since we now share in Christ, we also share in His eternal redemption. According to this eternal redemption, we are separated and sanctified forever.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:12).</p>
<p>The Lord purchased us by His own blood so that we might be sanctified, distinct from worldly people. When we go to shop for a piece of clothing, the moment we pay for a certain item, it becomes separated from all the others. When we were redeemed by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, we immediately obtained the fact of sanctification, the position of sanctification. In God&rsquo;s eyes we were separated to be sanctified unto Him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Sanctified by faith in Me&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>The Lord offered Himself for our sins and shed His blood for our redemption; these are facts that the Lord accomplished for our sanctification. To partake of these facts, we must believe in Him and be joined to Him by faith. Once we believe in Him and become one with Him by faith, we become holy through His redemption and shed blood, thereby possessing both the fact and the position of sanctification.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;But you were sanctified...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>Once we believe in the Lord, His name enables us to share in His accomplishments, that is, His sanctifying redemption. The Spirit of God then sanctifies us based on this redemption.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Sanctified in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<p>Once we are joined to the Lord by faith, we are in Christ. Once we are in Christ, we are sanctified. We obtain the fact of sanctification&mdash;the position of sanctification&mdash;in Christ. It is in Christ that God acknowledges us as being sanctified.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Called saints&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:2).</p>
<p>Our being saved is our being called by God. God&rsquo;s calling calls us out from the world to Himself. Thus, once we are called and saved, we are sanctified and become saints. In the Bible saints are those who have been separated unto God. A called and saved person is a separated and sanctified person in the eyes of God. Not only were Paul and Peter saints, but all of us who have been saved are saints because we have been called to be holy unto God.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;God&rsquo;s chosen ones, holy&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 3:12).</p>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes, God&rsquo;s chosen ones are holy because He has separated His elect to be sanctified to Himself.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;The new man, which was created according to God in...holiness of the reality&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:24).</p>
<p>At the time we were saved, we obtained a new life within. This new life makes us a new man, which was created in holiness of the reality according to God, that is, according to God&rsquo;s holy nature. The new man possesses God&rsquo;s holy nature and can understand God&rsquo;s holy truth. We obtained all this upon our salvation. When we were saved, we acquired the fact of sanctification in Christ. On the one hand, this fact gives us the position and ground of sanctification before God. On the other hand, it supplies us with a holy life and holy nature that we may have a holy essence&mdash;holiness itself&mdash;and ability. Thus, it enables us to desire holiness, to understand holy matters, that is, the reality of holiness, and to live in the reality of holiness. The position of sanctification and the life of sanctification&mdash;the seed of sanctification&mdash;were obtained by us once we gained our place in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF SANCTIFICATION&mdash;PRESENT</h2>
<p>The experience of sanctification concerns the holy life we live after our salvation. Although we obtained the fact and position of sanctification upon believing, the experience of sanctification occurs only after our salvation.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Pursue...sanctification, without which no one will see the Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:14).</p>
<p>To pursue sanctification means to pursue the holy life within or, we may say, to pursue the sense of holiness according to the life within. The life within us is holy. Inwardly, the Lord requires us to be holy, leads us to be holy, and gives us a sensation of holiness and an inclination toward holiness. We should follow His holy guidance, His holy sense, to live a holy life and walk in the way of holiness. Without this, we will not see the Lord or have fellowship with Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;According to the Holy One who called you, you yourselves also be holy in all your manner of life&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:15).</p>
<p>Since God who called us is holy and different from everything else, we, who have been called, must be sanctified in all things after being saved in order to match His holy nature.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;What kind of persons ought you to be in holy manner of life and godliness&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 3:11).</p>
<p>In the future what is contrary to God&rsquo;s holy nature will be burned by fire. This shows the need for everything pertaining to us to be separated and sanctified unto God after we are saved.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Let us cleanse ourselves from all defilement of flesh and of spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 7:1; see also 1 Thes. 4:3-4, 7).</p>
<p>God, being absolutely holy, cannot tolerate anything that is contrary to His holy nature. Therefore, we need to fear Him, remove all filthiness of flesh and spirit both within and without, and put off all unholiness, that is, all that does not agree with God&rsquo;s holy nature.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your fruit unto sanctification&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:22).</p>
<p>Sanctification stresses the need to be separated to God from all that is apart from God in order to be holy unto God. Although it does not exclusively deal with deliverance from sin, deliverance from sin is included. Therefore, being freed from sin is an experience of sanctification, involving fruit that is unto sanctification.</p>
<p>What is spoken of in Romans 6:22 is not sanctification itself but the fruit unto sanctification; thus, it is not a question of salvation but of deliverance from sin after salvation. To be delivered from sin after we are saved is to be separated from what is outside of God; hence, it is also an experience of God&rsquo;s holiness which bears fruit unto sanctification.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Disciplined...that we might partake of His holiness&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 12:10).</p>
<p>After we are saved, the life of Christ demands that we be holy, the truth of the Bible teaches us to be holy, and the Holy Spirit inspires us to be holy. However, we often refuse to follow the sense of holiness from the life of Christ, to obey the teaching of the truth from the Bible, or to submit to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit in order to sanctify ourselves. God&rsquo;s chastisement delivers us from the unholy matters that we are reluctant to forsake so that we can partake bountifully of His holy nature.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:21).</p>
<p>Anything that is apart from God is dishonorable, and only what is of God is honorable. We should put off all that is outside of God and be sanctified to be a vessel unto honor, useful to the Master.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;The God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete, without blame, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 5:23).</p>
<p>After we are saved and before we are raptured to meet the Lord, God will sanctify us wholly. To be sanctified wholly is to have our spirit, soul, and body separated from all that is apart from God to be holy unto Him. At the time of our salvation, our spirit obtained God&rsquo;s holy life and nature; however, the various parts of our being have not shed all that is outside of God to fully possess God&rsquo;s holiness. Thus, after our salvation and in our experience, God causes all that is outside of Him to be put away from the conscience, intuition, and fellowship, which are the parts of our spirit; from the mind, emotion, and will, which are the parts of our soul; and from the parts of our body so that we may become holy. The holiness we experience after we are saved is God&rsquo;s sanctification of every part of our being, which enables us to live in His holiness and be full of His holiness.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">JUSTIFICATION</h1>
<p>According to the order in 1 Corinthians 6:11, justification follows sanctification. Holiness is God&rsquo;s nature, whereas righteousness is His procedure. Sanctification causes us to be according to God&rsquo;s nature, and justification makes us right according to His procedure. If we are not according to His nature, we cannot be right according to His procedure. Therefore, in the order of God&rsquo;s salvation, we are first sanctified and then justified; we are first made according to His nature and then made right according to His procedure. This is not to say that we obtain sanctification and justification at different times. No, we obtain both simultaneously at the time of our salvation. However, in considering the order of blessing in God&rsquo;s salvation, sanctification comes before justification.</p>
<p>Justification means that God declares man to be righteous according to His very righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JUSTIFIED BEFORE GOD&mdash;AT THE TIME OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>According to the Scriptures, there are three aspects of justification. The first aspect is before God, which we obtained when we believe. In other words, once we are saved, we are justified, or we may say, once we are justified, we are saved, since God&rsquo;s salvation includes justification. A justified person is a saved person.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not justified out of works of law&rdquo;; &ldquo;Out of the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before Him&rdquo;; &ldquo;All our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment&rdquo;; &ldquo;How then can a man be righteous with God?&rdquo;; &ldquo;There is none righteous, not even one&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:16; Rom. 3:20; Isa. 64:6; Job 25:4; Rom. 3:10).</p>
<p>Since justification is God&rsquo;s declaration that a man is righteous according to His righteousness, it is not possible for a man to be justified by the works of the law. God&rsquo;s righteousness is absolutely perfect, but no one is perfect before the law of God. Thus, no flesh, that is, no fleshly person, can be justified before God by the works of the law. Not only is our unrighteousness unable to stand before God&rsquo;s righteousness, but even our righteousnesses are like a soiled garment before His righteousness. We are unable to meet God&rsquo;s righteous requirement. It is not possible for us to be justified before God through the works of the law or through behavior. Perhaps our behavior is better than others, but it is short compared to God&rsquo;s righteousness. According to God&rsquo;s righteousness, there is none righteous, not even one.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Having been justified by His grace&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:7; see also Rom. 3:24).</p>
<p>Because of man&rsquo;s weakness, no one can be justified before God by the law. However, any person can be justified by God by His grace. The law requires that man be perfect in order to be justified out of works of the law, but no one can do this. In justification by grace, however, God freely fulfills all His righteous requirements so that justification can be received and obtained by every man. God accomplished everything for us so that we might be justified freely without any effort or doing on our part; this is grace. What we cannot accomplish by the law, we can obtain through grace.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:24).</p>
<p>We are justified by grace through the redemption of the Lord Jesus. Without the Lord Jesus accomplishing redemption for us on the cross to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement, God could not justify us by His grace even if He so desired. God&rsquo;s justifying grace cannot come to us apart from the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. When someone pays for a Bible, it can be freely given. Similarly, God can give us His justifying grace because the Lord paid the price of redemption.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Having now been justified in His blood&rdquo;</strong> (Rom 5:9).</p>
<p>The blood of the Lord Jesus is the sign of His death for us. Therefore, the blood is the price He paid to redeem us. The price of this blood satisfied all the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness upon us. Hence, this blood causes God&rsquo;s grace to justify us according to His righteousness. The Lord&rsquo;s blood accomplished what we could never accomplish through our behavior before God&rsquo;s righteous law. We can be justified before God&rsquo;s righteousness in the Lord&rsquo;s blood.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Raised for our justification&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 4:25).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s death and shed blood satisfied all God&rsquo;s righteous demands, and the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection is the very proof and guarantee of God&rsquo;s righteous requirement being satisfied. Since the Lord&rsquo;s death and blood fulfilled all God&rsquo;s righteous requirements, God raised Him from the dead for our justification. Before God the Lord&rsquo;s blood acts as the foundation and declaration of our justification, and the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection serves as the guarantee and proof of our justification. Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood satisfied all God&rsquo;s righteous requirements, the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection causes us to be justified and accepted before God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Justified by faith&rdquo;; &ldquo;Justified out of faith in Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:28; Gal. 2:16; see also Rom. 5:1; Gal. 3:8, 24).</p>
<p>The Bible definitely tells us that man&rsquo;s justification before God is not, and cannot be, by works; it is only by faith. Works are related to what we can do; faith is related to what Christ has accomplished for us. Works require our effort, but faith receives and obtains without effort. None of us can truly work, but all of us can believe.</p>
<p>Faith believes in the Lord and in what He has done for us. He died and shed His blood to accomplish redemption, satisfying God&rsquo;s righteous requirement so that God can justify us according to His righteousness. Then the Lord was raised from the dead so that we may be justified before God. However, if we do not believe, we will have no share in Him and what He did, and we will not obtain God&rsquo;s justification through His redemption. We must believe, being one with Him by faith, believing into Him, and receiving Him and what He has done for us by faith. Then we will partake of Him and His redemption, obtaining God&rsquo;s justification through His redemption in Him.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;You were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>Once we believe and receive the Lord and what He did by faith, His name and the Spirit of God justify us. His name justifies us in name, and the Spirit of God justifies us in reality. Once we are one with the Lord by faith, we share in Him. His name causes us to be justified in name and position, and the Spirit of God causes us to experience God&rsquo;s justification in reality.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Justified in Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:17).</p>
<p>We are not only justified by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, by His resurrection, and in His name but we are also justified in Him. If we are not in Him, the Lord&rsquo;s blood, the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, and the Lord&rsquo;s name have nothing to do with us. We can partake of Him, His blood, His resurrection, and His name because we are joined to the Lord and have entered into Him by faith. By being in His resurrection and His name, we are justified by God. We are justified in Christ and by Christ, never in ourselves or by ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;Justified freely&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:24).</p>
<p>Our justification is free because of the grace of God, which comes through the Lord&rsquo;s redemption by His blood and which is in Him. It is not related to any price we paid, any of our works, or anything in ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;From all the things...you were...justified&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:39).</p>
<p>Our being justified freely by God&rsquo;s grace through the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, by His blood, and in Him is not merely from a few things but from all things. Once we believe, we are justified by God from all things.</p>
<p><strong>11. &ldquo;It is God who justifies&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:33).</p>
<p>It is God who justifies us in the Lord upon our believing. It was not we ourselves or others but God who justified us. We are justified by the only One who can condemn us and also forgive our sins. Since He justified us, who can accuse us and condemn us?</p>
<p><strong>12. &ldquo;Who became...to us from God...righteousness&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 1:30).</p>
<p>God not only justified us through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, declaring us righteous according to His righteousness and giving us His righteousness (Rom. 3:22; Phil. 3:9). He even made the Lord Jesus Himself our righteousness. Once we believe into Christ, we are in Christ. God causes us to be in Him, clothed with Him, and covered by Him so that He might be our righteousness. Just as He is righteous and acceptable before God, we also are righteous and acceptable before God in Him. We obtained this when we were saved.</p><h2 class="head1">JUSTIFIED BEFORE MEN&mdash;<br />
AFTER SALVATION</h2>
<p>The Bible shows that the second aspect of justification is before men. We obtain this gradually after we are saved.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A man is justified by works&rdquo;</strong> (James 2:24).</p>
<p>When we were saved, the justification we obtained before God was by faith and had nothing to do with works. But after we are saved, our justification before men is by works, not by faith. Faith caused us to be justified by God at the time of our salvation; works cause us to be justified by men after our salvation. Although a person is justified by God through faith at the time of salvation, he may not necessarily be justified by man through works after salvation. After we are saved, we must bring forth the fruits of repentance and live righteously with righteous behavior by the life and Spirit within us. We will then be a righteous person who does righteousness and is justified by men.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 5:16).</p>
<p>After we were saved and justified by God, we became children of light. Following our salvation, we must be children of light, letting the light of life in us shine before men so that they may see our good works and call us righteous.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;We exercise foresight for what is honorable not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 8:21).</p>
<p>We should exercise foresight for what is honorable in the sight of men in order to match our justified status. Otherwise, even though we may be justified before God, we will not appear to be justified before men.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;He who serves Christ in this is well pleasing to God and approved by men&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 14:18).</p>
<p>After our salvation, we should live a life of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit to serve Christ. If we do, we will not only be well pleasing to God but also approved by men, that is, justified by men and before men.</p>
<p>Although our justification before God does not require works, we should do works before men after we are justified by God in order to be justified by them. We say that we are a Christian, but our behavior may speak to the contrary. We say that God has justified us, but our works may not be that of a righteous man of God. We say that we have faith before God, but there is no testimony of works before men. Faith is before God; works are before men. Many brothers do not have a testimony of works before their wives, so they cannot be justified by their wives. Many sisters do not shine out the light of life before their husbands, so they are not approved by their husbands. There are also many brothers and sisters who are without shining and righteous works in the presence of their colleagues, schoolmates, relatives, and neighbors, so they do not obtain praises from them. I dare not say that such persons are not saved, but they are not justified before men, even though they have been justified before God. After our salvation, we must, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, have a testimony before men with righteous works so that our being and doing will match God&rsquo;s justification in order to be justified by men.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JUSTIFIED BEFORE THE JUDGMENT SEAT OF CHRIST&mdash;AT THE LORD&rsquo;S COMING</h2>
<p>The third aspect of our justification is before the judgment seat of Christ. This will occur when our Lord comes back to judge the saints.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord...until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then there will be praise to each from God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 4:4-5).</p>
<p>In many places in the books of Romans, Galatians, and Philippians, Paul clearly and definitely states that he was justified before God. But in 1 Corinthians, he spoke of the justification that would be obtained when the Lord comes again to judge the saints, not of the justification obtained at salvation, and for this he had no assurance that he would be justified by the Lord. This justification is based on our being and our doing, our works and our living, after salvation. Our life and work, our being and doing, determine whether we will be justified by the Lord when He comes to judge the saints. The Lord will judge us and decide whether we are righteous according to our work, action, thought, and counsel.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:10).</p>
<p>At the Lord&rsquo;s coming, those who are saved will be judged before His judgment seat to receive the things they have done, according to what they practiced, whether good or bad. This is the judgment at the judgment seat of Christ, and it is different from the judgment at the great white throne. The world will be judged at the great white throne to determine who will be saved or who will perish. The judgment seat of Christ is related to whether the saints should be rewarded or punished; it does not concern our salvation. This judgment is based on our work after our salvation. If our work and actions please the Lord, we will be approved and justified by Him at His judgment. This justification is in the future, and it is related to our reward, not our salvation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">RECONCILIATION</h1>
<p>Let us now look at the matter of being reconciled to God. According to the original Greek language, to be reconciled to God means that we have a complete change before God. Since we had problems with God, we need to have a thorough change before God. This complete change before God is our reconciliation to God.</p>
<p>The Bible does not tell us that God is reconciled to us but that we are reconciled to Him. Since God never had problems with us, He does not need to be reconciled to us. We were the ones who had problems with Him and who need to be reconciled to Him. In order for us to be reconciled to Him, He did something particular for us in His salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NECESSITY OF BEING RECONCILED TO GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You, though once alienated and enemies in your mind because of your evil works, He now has reconciled&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:21-22; see also Rom. 5:10).</p>
<p>Because of the fall, man is not only far from God but also alienated from Him. He is even an enemy to God in his mind because of his wicked works. Therefore, man not only needs to repent, turn to God, and be forgiven by God, but he also needs to be reconciled to Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be. And...cannot please God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:7-8).</p>
<p>Since man is at enmity against God, he is not subject to the law of God; he cannot be subject to the law even if he so desires. When man rebelled against God, he inherited a rebellious nature that keeps him from being subject to the law of God. Man cannot please God. Man is sinful and needs forgiveness. He also cannot be subject to God in order to abide peacefully with God. Consequently, he needs to be reconciled to God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;They did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:28).</p>
<p>Man is alienated from God to such an extent that he does not approve of holding God in his knowledge. It is not that man cannot know God; rather, he does not approve of knowing Him. Since man deliberately refuses knowledge of God, sets Him aside, and rejects Him, man needs to be reconciled to Him.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;There is no fear of God before their eyes&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:18).</p>
<p>Since man is at enmity against God in his heart and is unwilling to subject himself to God or approve of knowing God, there is no fear of God before his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Hateful to God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:30).</p>
<p>Man not only has no fear of God, but he is even hateful toward Him.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;A blasphemer&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 1:13).</p>
<p>Man not only hates God but he goes a further step to blaspheme God. Hate is an inward feeling, whereas blasphemy involves outward words and actions. Man hates God in his thoughts inwardly and blasphemes God in his words and actions outwardly. He is at enmity with God in his heart, does not approve of Him or agree with Him, and even detests God. He has no fear of God before his eyes, then he hates God in his heart, and ultimately, he blasphemes God. Man truly needs to be reconciled to God.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;The fool has said in his heart, / There is no God&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 14:1).</p>
<p>Man has problems with God to such an extent that he says that there is no God. How much he has forsaken God! How blasphemous!</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;The wicked man...his thoughts are this: There is no God!&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 10:4).</p>
<p>Since man says that there is no God, he thinks and schemes as if there is no God, and he is audacious in his desires, committing all manner of acts to oppose, despise, and deny God.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;There is none who seeks out God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:11).</p>
<p>Since man thinks there is no God, he does not seek God; he remains a godless person, spending his life in a godless existence with a godless living.</p>
<p><strong>10. &ldquo;Sons of disobedience...Children of wrath&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:2-3).</p>
<p>Because of the above conditions, man is a son of disobedience before God, rebelling against God and resisting God. He is a child of wrath in God&rsquo;s eyes. The relationship between God and man has fallen to such a state. How man needs to be reconciled to God! How he needs a thorough change before God!</p><h2 class="head1">THE ACCOMPLISHMENT<br />
OF BEING RECONCILED TO GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He now has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:22).</p>
<p>Although man has problems with God and needs to be reconciled to Him, he has given no thought to this matter nor could he devise a way to be reconciled. But God, who has never had a problem with man and does not need to be reconciled to man, wants man to be reconciled to Him. He made a way of restoration so that we might be reconciled to Him because He loves us.</p>
<p>In order for us to be reconciled to Him, God accomplished a way of restoration through the Lord&rsquo;s redemption. God reconciled us to Himself through the Lord&rsquo;s death in the flesh. Just as the forgiveness of our sins is based upon the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, so also is our reconciliation to God. Without the Lord&rsquo;s redemption, there would be no way for us to be reconciled to God. If the Lord did not accomplish propitiation for our sins, God could not reconcile us to Himself; even if we were to turn to Him, He could not accept us. However, the Lord&rsquo;s redemption solved every problem and removed every barrier between us and God so that we might return and be reconciled to Him and He might receive us gladly.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:20).</p>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s shedding of His blood on the cross, God made propitiation for our sins, solved all the problems between us and Him, made peace, and reconciled us to Himself.</p>
<p>Through the Lord Jesus and His redemption, God reconciled not only man but all things to Himself. This can be compared to a divorced wife who is also reconciled to her children when she is reconciled to her husband, their father. Man represents the whole creation, and all creation hangs on him. God reconciled man and creation, both of which were at odds with Him, to Himself through the cross of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Might reconcile both...to God through the cross&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:16).</p>
<p>The cross of the Lord Jesus is like a bridge spanning the gulf between God and man so that man may communicate with God and return to God&rsquo;s presence. God reconciled both Jews and Gentiles to Himself through the cross of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:19).</p>
<p>Even though man hates and rejects God, God still loves and longs for him. Although man refuses God, God still wants him. Therefore, God came to reconcile man to Himself. He sent Christ to accomplish this through the shedding of His blood and His redemption on the cross. Christ accomplished all that was necessary to reconcile man to God. God, therefore, reconciles man to Himself in Christ. It is in Christ that God reconciles man back to Himself.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The ministry of reconciliation&rdquo;; &ldquo;We beseech you on behalf of Christ, Be reconciled to God&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:18, 20).</p>
<p>To reconcile man to Himself, God not only accomplished all the requirements of reconciliation through the Lord Jesus but He also ministers reconciliation through the Holy Spirit; that is, He moves His ministers by the Holy Spirit to beseech man to be reconciled to Him, and simultaneously, He does the same thing in man. He earnestly longs for man to be reconciled to Him, and He even causes the Holy Spirit through His ministers to beseech man on behalf of Christ to be reconciled to Him. What love! What earnestness! Because many ministers have been moved by God&rsquo;s earnest love and thus express it, they eagerly exhort people to repent and turn to God, pleading with them to receive God&rsquo;s grace. God not only wants and even waits for man to be reconciled to Him, but He also sends others to admonish and plead with man to be reconciled to Him. This is like a husband who longs for the return of his wife who has problems with him and sends people to ask her to come back. If man is not reconciled to God, the problem is not with God but with man. Any problem with reconciliation is related to man&rsquo;s unwillingness to receive God&rsquo;s love, to hear God&rsquo;s plea, to answer God&rsquo;s beseeching, and to be reconciled to God.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;We, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:10).</p>
<p>God did not come to reconcile us to Himself at the time of our repentance and seeking; rather, He came when we were His enemies. While we were still His enemies, He came to reconcile us through the death of His Son. Because of the Lord&rsquo;s death, God will reconcile to Himself anyone who is an enemy and who has problems with Him as long as he is willing to be reconciled.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Having been justified out of faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:1).</p>
<p>We have peace toward God because we have been justified by faith. Being reconciled to God is also a result of faith. The Lord Jesus accomplished all that is necessary for us to be reconciled to God; however, we still must believe, confess, and receive by faith what He accomplished. Once we believe, God reconciles us to Himself through the Lord Jesus and His accomplishments. Upon believing, we receive God&rsquo;s forgiveness and justification, and then we are reconciled to Him. Although there is a sequence to God&rsquo;s reconciliation, forgiveness, and justification, we receive these items simultaneously when we believe.</p>
<p>When we are reconciled to God, we have peace toward Him. Originally, we had problems with God and did not have peace. After believing in the Lord, the problems between us and God do not exist and we are reconciled to Him; therefore, we have peace toward God. This was accomplished by God in Christ for us, and it is obtained by us through faith.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULTS OF BEING RECONCILED TO GOD</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:11).</p>
<p>There are at least three results to being reconciled to God. First, we can boast in God. Originally, God was man&rsquo;s joy, but once we developed a problem with God and lost God, we were godless and without any peace and joy. Consequently, we sought after recreation, entertainment, and even sin to find enjoyment. Now that we are reconciled to God, we have obtained God and possess God, who is our joy and boast. We feel sweet whenever we think of Him; we feel happy whenever He is mentioned.</p>
<p>Formerly, we took pleasure in drinking, smoking, gambling, movies, or dances, but now that we have been reconciled to God, we boast and joy in God and with God. We love to pray and draw near to God; whenever God is mentioned, our hearts beat with longing.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Love God&rdquo;; &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us...that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:28; 2 Cor. 5:14-15; see also 1 John 4:19).</p>
<p>The second result of being reconciled to God is love for God. Those who have been reconciled to God love Him, and those who have peace toward God love Him. We boast in God as our enjoyment, and we express our love toward Him.</p>
<p>Once we consider how God loved us, how He came and reconciled us to Himself, how He sent the Lord Jesus to accomplish all that was necessary for this reconciliation, how the Lord Jesus died, bled, and was resurrected for us, our heart of love is stirred toward Him. We desire to show Him our love by laying down everything to please Him and to live for Him all our lives.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Serve...God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 1:9-10).</p>
<p>The third result of being reconciled to God is service to God. Those who are reconciled to God love Him, and those who are reconciled long to serve Him. Loving God is a demonstration of our heart toward God, and serving God is our practical action before Him. The very love through which God reconciled us to Himself constrains us in our heart to serve Him until the Lord returns.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">REGENERATION</h1>
<p>Regeneration is a great subject in the Scriptures and a very important part of God&rsquo;s salvation. The aspects of God&rsquo;s salvation in the previous chapters&mdash;forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, and reconciliation with God&mdash;are all related to regeneration. God forgives us, cleanses us, sanctifies us, justifies us, and reconciles us to Himself so that He can regenerate us. Man assumes that he would be free from all problems if he only received the forgiveness of sins and was justified before God. But the salvation that God accomplished for us does not stop with these items. God&rsquo;s salvation not only grants us an outward position of being accepted by Him but also involves our inward regeneration, through which we receive a life that pleases Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;You must be born anew&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:3, 7).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that we must be born anew because unless we are born anew, we cannot see the kingdom of God. The kingdom of God is the realm where God rules. In this realm God does His will and manifests all that He is, and everything is spiritual and heavenly. The fleshly and the earthly cannot understand what occurs in this realm. This is the meaning of <em>cannot see.</em> To understand, one must be born anew.</p>
<p>Every kind of life is a sphere, a kingdom with its own realm and boundaries, and the things in it can be apprehended only by those who possess its life. For example, the bird life exists in its own realm, and only those with a bird&rsquo;s life and nature understand this realm. Those who are outside the sphere of birds cannot understand the things of the bird kingdom because they do not have the life of a bird or the function of a bird&rsquo;s life. In the same way, the life of God has its own realm. This realm is the kingdom of God, and the things in it can be understood only by those who possess the life of God. Since man is outside the kingdom of God and without the life of God and the function of God&rsquo;s life, he cannot understand things that belong to the kingdom and sphere of God. In order to see the kingdom of God, he must be regenerated and obtain the life of God.</p>
<p>No one can understand the things of a particular realm apart from the life of that realm. It is also impossible for the life of a lower realm to comprehend things that belong to a higher realm. How high is God&rsquo;s life compared to man&rsquo;s life! In order for man, who belongs to a lower realm, to understand the things of God&rsquo;s higher realm, he must obtain the life of God&rsquo;s higher realm. To possess this life, he must be regenerated.</p>
<p>Man and God have two fundamentally different lives in two different realms, two different kingdoms. In order for man in the human sphere to enter into the kingdom of God or the sphere of God, he must have the life of God. If a man has the life of God, he will share in the kingdom of God spontaneously. To possess the life of God, one must be born anew.</p>
<p>Many presume that a human being needs to be born anew because he is evil. However, we need to be regenerated whether we are good or evil. We need to be born again because our life is not the life of God, not merely because our life is evil. Even if our life is good, it is still only human. It is not the life of God, it does not have the function of God&rsquo;s life, and it cannot understand or do the things of God. Therefore, even if our life is faultless, we still need to be born anew, to receive the life of God, so that we can understand the things of God&rsquo;s realm and participate in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Jesus answered,...Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:5-6).</p>
<p>Our human life is incapable of understanding the things of God&rsquo;s realm and God&rsquo;s kingdom, and it is also of the flesh since it was born of the flesh. It does not matter how we feel about our own life; in actuality, our life is of the flesh and comes from the flesh. Whatever is of the flesh and comes from the flesh is flesh. The flesh is &ldquo;brought forth in iniquity&rdquo; (Psa. 51:5), originating from sin; it is &ldquo;sold under sin&rdquo; (Rom. 7:14) and belongs to sin; in it &ldquo;nothing good dwells&rdquo; (v. 18), and there is only evil; it is &ldquo;weak&rdquo; and &ldquo;profits nothing&rdquo; pertaining to the things of God (8:3; John 6:63); it is &ldquo;incurable&rdquo; (Jer. 17:9); it is at &ldquo;enmity against God,&rdquo; &ldquo;not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be,&rdquo; and it &ldquo;cannot please God&rdquo; (Rom. 8:7-8); it is &ldquo;alienated from the life of God&rdquo; (Eph. 4:18), having nothing to do with God; and it is unchangeable. Most people think that man can change for the better. This is especially true of the Chinese teachers of ethics who suggest that human beings can be reformed. Yet in the Bible, God uses two unchangeable things, the skin of a Cushite and the spots of a leopard, to illustrate how man cannot be changed. In essence, God is saying that if these two things could be changed, the flesh of man, or the man of flesh, could also be changed (Jer. 13:23).</p>
<p>However, the skin of a Cushite will never turn white. Even if the skin were painted white, it would still be essentially black. We all have considered changing ourselves for the better. In whatever way we might change, however, it would merely be like applying white paint on the outside. Inside we would still be dark. We also think that we can stop sinning. Even if we do not sin outwardly, we would still be sinful inwardly. We may succeed in changing our outward behavior, but we cannot alter our inward nature.</p>
<p>The leopard&rsquo;s spots also cannot be changed. We may clothe a leopard with a spotless garment, but its spots will be untouched underneath. We may decorate and dress ourselves up on the outside, but inwardly we are still the same. We may change our outward form, but we cannot change our inward essence.</p>
<p>The man of the flesh, or the fleshly man, is unchangeable. No matter the amount of outward adjustment, our inward nature cannot be changed. Regardless of correction, a man of flesh is still the flesh. The flesh is the flesh, and it will never become the spirit. Only spirit can be born of the Spirit, and only what is born of the Spirit is spirit. To be born of the Spirit, there is the need of regeneration.</p>
<p>Since the kingdom of God is of God, it is also spiritual, because God is Spirit. Fleshly man can never have a part in a spiritual kingdom. In order for man to partake of this spiritual kingdom, he must have a spirit that is born of the Spirit. Therefore, he must be regenerated.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who were begotten not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:13).</p>
<p>The literal meaning of <em>regeneration</em> is &ldquo;to be born again.&rdquo; Nicodemus understood this to mean that he had to enter into his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time (3:4). Although he understood the meaning of the word <em>regeneration,</em> he misunderstood the significance of regeneration. Although, literally speaking, regeneration is a rebirth, the significance of regeneration is not about entering a mother&rsquo;s womb to be born again. Regeneration involves receiving the Spirit. Even if we could reenter into our mother&rsquo;s womb and be reborn, which is utterly impossible, we would still be flesh born of the flesh, not of the Spirit. Our spirit must be born of the Spirit. Only spirit can be born of the Spirit. To be born of the Spirit is to be born of God, for God is Spirit. Therefore, regeneration is to be born of God.</p>
<p>Regeneration is not a birth according to blood, according to the will of the flesh, or according to the will of man, which only enables man to receive another fleshly life. Rather, regeneration is to be born of God so that man may receive a spiritual life. We were originally born of blood, of the will of the flesh, and of the will of man. In our first birth, we received a life of the human flesh, which cannot share in the kingdom of God. Therefore, we need to be born again of God so that we may receive God&rsquo;s spiritual life and participate in God&rsquo;s kingdom. Since this birth from God is a rebirth, it is regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Born anew&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:3).</p>
<p>In John 3:3 the word <em>anew</em> is synonymous with <em>from above</em> in verse 31; therefore, to be &ldquo;born anew&rdquo; also has the meaning of being &ldquo;born from above.&rdquo; Our first birth from our parents was from the earth and from below since our parents were on the earth and below, but our second birth from God, regeneration, was a birth from the heavens and from above, since God is in the heavens and above. Since the regenerated life is from above, a regenerated person also delights in the things that are above. Whatever man&rsquo;s life issues from and belongs to, it enjoys. A fleshly life of the earth likes the things of the earth because it is from the earth and belongs to the earth; a spiritual life from the heavens loves heavenly things because it is from the heavens and belongs to the heavens. Regeneration enables one to gain this heavenly life.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:5).</p>
<p>Verse 5 is the Lord&rsquo;s explanation of regeneration. When Nicodemus heard Him speak of regeneration, he thought that he had to go back into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born again. Therefore, the Lord explained that regeneration means to be born of water and the Holy Spirit. Regeneration is not related to going back into a mother&rsquo;s womb and being born again of the flesh; rather, it involves being born of water and the Holy Spirit. Some think that being born of water means to be born of the word of the truth. They say that <em>water</em> refers to the word. But we do not agree with this because the Lord said that one must be born of water and the Spirit. The Spirit spoken of here is the Holy Spirit; all Bible scholars agree on this. Therefore, why should we think that the water spoken of here is more than just water; that is, what is the basis for interpreting it as the word? If we interpret the end of the verse literally, we should interpret the beginning of the verse literally. We should not interpret <em>Spirit</em> literally in the second part of the verse and interpret <em>water</em> spiritually in the first part of the verse. If we interpret <em>water</em> literally, it must refer to just water. In fact, John the Baptist had already spoken with the Pharisees about the matter of &ldquo;water and the Spirit.&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me...will baptize you in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 3:11). He meant that he wanted the Pharisees to receive both the baptism in water that he preached and the baptism in the Holy Spirit that the Lord would give. The Pharisees, however, rejected the water baptism that he preached (Luke 7:29-30). Therefore, the Lord brought up the matter of water and the Spirit with Nicodemus who came to visit Him. When we read this word today, we do not easily understand what it refers to; however, when Nicodemus heard the Lord&rsquo;s word, he was very clear that it referred to the water baptism preached by John the Baptist and to the Holy Spirit whom the Lord would give. Thus, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking about being born of water and the Spirit was in reference to passing through the water of John&rsquo;s baptism and to receiving the Holy Spirit given by the Lord in order to be regenerated.</p>
<p>The water baptism preached by John the Baptist requires people to repent and to confess that they are incurably corrupt and worthy only of death and to then enter into the waters of baptism to be buried and terminated. The Holy Spirit given by the Lord enables those who believe in Him to obtain life and be resurrected. Together these two things mean that one must repent, confessing that he is corrupt and worthy of death, believe in the Lord, and receive the life given by Him in the Spirit. After one passes through these two processes, he is regenerated. Thus, on the one hand, regeneration is a termination of the old self-life through repentance, and on the other hand, a receiving of new life in the Spirit through belief in the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:6).</p>
<p>Regeneration is of God&rsquo;s Spirit, and through regeneration we obtain God&rsquo;s life from God&rsquo;s Spirit. In regeneration God&rsquo;s Spirit enters us and gives us His life. The life we obtain in regeneration is just the Spirit because in regeneration we obtain God&rsquo;s spiritual life from God&rsquo;s Spirit. In regeneration our spirit is born of the Spirit; that is, our human spirit is born of God&rsquo;s Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:8).</p>
<p>Because the life a person receives in regeneration is spiritual, it is invisible; it can be felt but not seen. Just as the wind can be felt without being seen, the life from God&rsquo;s Spirit in regeneration has a power that can be felt without being seen. Although we cannot see this life, we can feel it; although we cannot show it to others, others can sense it. After being regenerated, we feel as if there is something marvelous within us. Even those around us can sense our marvelous condition. The marvelous thing within us is the life we gained in regeneration, and the marvelous condition that others sense is the expression of this life.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 36:26).</p>
<p>Regeneration does not change our outward actions; rather, it changes our inward heart. It does not improve our old man; instead, it gives us a new spirit. Our old heart was stubborn and as hard as stone. When God regenerates us, He takes away our heart of stone and gives us a pliable new heart, one that is soft as flesh. Moreover, God puts a new spirit in us. Regeneration causes us to obtain a new heart and a new spirit, which begin to inwardly transform us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF REGENERATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Through the &ldquo;Finished&rdquo; Redemption of Christ</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:14-15).</p>
<p>The bronze serpent was lifted up on a pole to be judged by God in place of the sinning Israelites so that those who were poisoned and should have died would live when they looked on it. Similarly, the Lord Jesus was lifted up on the cross to be judged by God in place of us sinners so that we who deserve death would obtain eternal life as soon as we believe into Him. Thus, our deadened spirit within us could be enlivened and regenerated.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit&rdquo;</strong> (John 12:24).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was crucified not only to redeem us from our sins but also to release His life. He was a grain of wheat with God&rsquo;s life hidden within Him. Without His death, God&rsquo;s life would have remained only in Him, the unique grain of wheat, and would not have been released. When He died, He released the life of God that was hidden in Him into us, giving us His life and making us the many grains.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:3).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s death released His life, and His resurrection caused His life to enter into us and regenerate us. Therefore, God regenerated us through the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection accomplished redemption and everything for us so that we would be regenerated. On the one hand, His death redeemed us from all our sins, and on the other hand, it released His life. His resurrection caused His life to enter into us and regenerate us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through the Ongoing Work of the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Born of the Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:8, see also v. 5).</p>
<p>From our perspective, the accomplishments of the Lord&rsquo;s redemption are objective and outside of us; they still need to be worked into our spirit. Based on the accomplishments of the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit works these accomplishments into us. While the Lord Jesus accomplished the fact of our regeneration, the Holy Spirit causes us to experience regeneration. The Holy Spirit comes to convict us concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment (16:8). He causes us to see that we are sinful, that the Lord has borne our sins for the sake of our justification, and that if we do not believe in the Lord, we will be judged. The Spirit convicts us of these things. Then He uses the word of the truth, the gospel, to regenerate us (James 1:18; 1 Cor. 4:15). He convicts us and causes us to repent, and then He causes us to believe the gospel and to be regenerated by receiving the Lord Jesus and all His accomplished work on our behalf. By means of the living word of God, He operates in us, regenerating us (1 Pet. 1:23), causing us to receive the life that was released by God through the Lord Jesus&rsquo; death and resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Through Man&rsquo;s Believing<br />
(Regeneration Occurring as Soon as One Believes)</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, who were begotten...of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:12-13).</p>
<p>In addition to the redemption of the Lord and the work of the Holy Spirit, there is also the need for believing before one can be regenerated. The Lord accomplished redemption and the Holy Spirit is operating, but if man refuses to believe, he will not be regenerated. If one wants to be regenerated, he must believe. The only requirement is to believe. Whenever a person believes in the Lord and receives Him as his Savior, he is regenerated, begotten of God, and obtains the life of God and the authority to be a child of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been begotten of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:1).</p>
<p>We must believe that Jesus is the Christ sent by God to be our Savior before we can obtain the life of God. We do not need to do anything but believe this in order for the Holy Spirit to enter into us, give us God&rsquo;s life, and cause us to be regenerated, to be born of God.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:15).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus accomplished everything that was needed for our regeneration. He did not leave anything for us to do except to believe in Him. The original meaning of believing in Him is to believe into Him or to be joined to Him by faith. The life of God is within Him, and we are joined to Him by faith; therefore, we spontaneously obtain the life of God within Him and are regenerated.</p>
<p>The only way for a person to be regenerated is to believe in the Lord. The Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, and He is waiting for us to believe. The Holy Spirit is also operating, hoping we will believe. As soon as we believe, the Holy Spirit immediately enters into us and regenerates us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULTS OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Made us alive&rdquo;; &ldquo;Has the life&rdquo;; &ldquo;Has eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:5; 1 John 5:12; John 6:47).</p>
<p>In the past, our spirit was deadened. Now that God has regenerated us, our deadened spirit has been made alive. We have the life of God, which is the eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Become children of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Partakers of the divine nature&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:12; 2 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<p>Regeneration causes us to obtain the life of God, to have the authority to become children of God, and to partake of the divine nature. Regeneration causes us to obtain the divine life, which is our authority to become children of God. Once we have the life of God, we have the authority to become children of God. Moreover, this life causes us to partake of the divine nature. Regeneration makes us children of God with the same life and nature as God, and it makes us like God, loving what God loves and hating what God hates.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I will also give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 36:26).</p>
<p>Regeneration also causes us to obtain a new heart and a new spirit. The new heart gives us new likes and preferences; the new spirit gives us new spiritual abilities and fellowship. In the past, we did not like or prefer the things of God, and we did not fellowship with God or understand and practice the things of God. We had no heart for or interest in the things of God; we even felt strange, disoriented, and weak when we touched them. Now that we have a new heart and a new spirit, we not only love and prefer the things of God, but we can also fellowship with God and understand and practice the things of God. We have a heart for and an interest in these things, we are able to understand them, and we have the strength and ability to practice them. These are the results of our regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;I will put My Spirit within you&rdquo;</strong> (Ezek. 36:27).</p>
<p>When God regenerates us, He not only gives us a new life, a new nature, a new heart, and a new spirit but He also puts His Spirit within us to strengthen the new life within and the function of our new nature, to increase the interest of our heart for matters of God, and to reveal the spiritual things in our new spirit, making it strong, living, able to understand the things of God, and quick to carry out God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Jesus Christ is in you&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 13:5).</p>
<p>Regeneration also causes us to have Jesus Christ in us. Regeneration gives us the Holy Spirit, who is the realization of the Lord Jesus. The Spirit abides in us. He is the Lord Jesus abiding in us as our life, power, and everything. Therefore, every regenerated person partakes of the Lord Jesus because he partakes of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;He is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:17).</p>
<p>Regeneration not only gives us a new life, a new nature, a new heart, and a new spirit, but it also makes us a new creation. In the past we were the old creation, stained by sin and corrupted by Satan; now we are the new creation with God&rsquo;s holy nature and reality. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:5).</p>
<p>Because regeneration makes us a new creation with the life and spiritual nature of God, it enables us to enter the kingdom of God and partake of His spiritual kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Unto a living hope...unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:3-4).</p>
<p>Regeneration also gives us a living hope and an inheritance in the heavens. This heavenly inheritance is spiritual, incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading. Anyone who wants to obtain this inheritance must also be heavenly, incorruptible, undefiled, and unfading, having a life with the same nature and condition as the inheritance. Since regeneration gives us a life with a nature that is heavenly, eternally unchanging, and unable to be defiled by sin, the world, or Satan, we can inherit such a spiritual, holy, eternal inheritance. Although we are still in the world and have not yet obtained the heavenly, better inheritance, we already have the heavenly life. This heavenly life causes us to live a heavenly life on earth today, and it will bring us into this heavenly inheritance in the future. This is a beautiful hope! It is given to us by regeneration.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROOF OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:15-16).</p>
<p>The fact of our regeneration is something we can know now. As soon as we are regenerated, the Holy Spirit comes into us and witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God with His life and nature. After being saved, whenever we pray, we love to call God &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; Whenever we call Him &ldquo;Abba, Father,&rdquo; we feel so happy within. The more we call God &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; the more comfortable we are inside. This proves that we are regenerated children of God.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:13).</p>
<p>We not only have the inward proof of the Holy Spirit telling us that we are regenerated, but we also have the outward proof of the Bible, the Word of God, which confirms this matter. First John 5:13 says that the preceding verses, which are also the Word of God, were written so that we, who believe into the name of the Son of God, would know that we have eternal life. God placed many words in the Bible which assuredly tell us that we have eternal life and are regenerated as soon as we believe into His Son. Therefore, from God&rsquo;s Word, the Bible, we know that we have God&rsquo;s eternal life and are regenerated.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:14).</p>
<p>In addition to the Holy Spirit within and the Bible without, the love we have for our brothers in the Lord confirms that we are regenerated. Our love for the brothers lets us know that we have passed out of death into life. Because we ourselves were begotten of God, we spontaneously love the brothers who also have been begotten of God. Thus, our love for our brothers who are born of God is a proof that we are born of God and are regenerated.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SECURITY OF REGENERATION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28).</p>
<p>Once we are regenerated, we will never perish. The Lord said that He gives us eternal life, so we will by no means perish forever. Eternal life is the eternal life of God that sustains us inwardly, so we will by no means perish forever. Moreover, we also have the Lord&rsquo;s powerful hand keeping us outwardly, so no one can snatch us away.</p>
<p>In the past, there was a young black slave in America who heard the gospel and was very joyful when she heard this Bible verse. When she went back to her master&rsquo;s house, she could not contain her joy. When one of her master&rsquo;s friends saw her condition, the friend asked, &ldquo;Why are you so happy?&rdquo; She replied that she was in the Lord&rsquo;s hand, and the Lord&rsquo;s hand was so powerful that no one could snatch her away. The friend made a joke and said, &ldquo;You better be careful! Do not be too happy! The Lord&rsquo;s hand is so big and the cracks between His fingers are also big, but you are so small. If you are too happy and are not careful, you might fall through the cracks!&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Sir, let me tell you that I also have the Lord&rsquo;s life, and His life is in me, so I am the little finger on His hand and will never fall off!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:29).</p>
<p>After we are regenerated, we not only have the Lord&rsquo;s powerful hand keeping us, but we also have the Father&rsquo;s powerful hand keeping us. The Father is greater than all. Since both His hand and the Lord&rsquo;s hand are keeping us, who can snatch us away and cause us to perish? Therefore, once we are regenerated, we are eternally secure. We will never perish.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">ETERNAL LIFE</h1>
<p>Eternal life is a great topic in the Bible; it is the greatest blessing God gives us in His salvation. Obtaining eternal life and enjoying the blessings of eternal life are divided into three different periods. The first period involves obtaining eternal life in this age, the second involves obtaining eternal life in the coming age, and the third involves the enjoyment of eternal life in eternity. If we do not differentiate between these three periods in our examination of what the Bible says about eternal life, we will not be clear.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OBTAINING ETERNAL LIFE IN THIS AGE</h2>
<p>We obtain eternal life in this age when we believe. When we believe in the Lord in this age, we obtain eternal life. We do not have to wait for the next age or for eternity to obtain it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eternal Life Being the Life of God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;That which was from the beginning&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:1).</p>
<p>Many misunderstand and think that eternal life involves a blessing in eternity. Actually, the Bible shows that eternal life is not a blessing in eternity; rather, it is the life of eternity. This eternal life was from the beginning. Only the life of God was from the beginning. Therefore, the eternal life is just the life of God, which existed before the universe and time began.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 1:2).</p>
<p>Eternal life is the life of God because God is eternal. In the Bible <em>eternal</em> means without beginning and without end. God is eternal, without beginning and without end, so His life is also eternal, without beginning and without end. The life of God, which has no beginning and no end, is the eternal life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eternal Life Being in the Lord Jesus</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Eternal life...is in His Son&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:11-12).</p>
<p>The Son of God is God incarnated, God Himself embodied in His Son; therefore, the life of God is also in His Son. This life, which is in God&rsquo;s Son, is the eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo;</strong> (John 1:4).</p>
<p>The incarnated Lord Jesus is the Son of God, so God&rsquo;s life, the eternal life, is in Him. When we receive Him and obtain Him, we also obtain the eternal life in Him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eternal Life Being Given Freely by God</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:23).</p>
<p>God considers His life, the eternal life, to be a gift freely given to us in the Lord Jesus. We do not need to pay for it; as long as we receive it, we obtain it.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;God gave to us eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:11).</p>
<p>Since the eternal life, the life of God, was given to us by God, it is God&rsquo;s gift, not God&rsquo;s reward, to us. It is freely given, not sold to us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Eternal Life Being Obtained<br />
at the Time of Believing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God so loved...that He gave...that everyone who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:16).</p>
<p>God loves us and gives us His life, the eternal life, which is in His Son for us to receive. The way to receive eternal life is to believe in His Son. As soon as we believe in His Son and receive His Son by faith, we obtain the eternal life that is in the Son.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:36).</p>
<p>Since the eternal life of God that is in His Son is a gift, as soon as we believe into His Son and obtain His Son, we spontaneously obtain the eternal life within His Son.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes...has eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:24).</p>
<p>When we hear the Lord&rsquo;s word, the gospel, and believe in Him, we immediately have eternal life. Many think that even though we believe in the Lord now, we do not obtain eternal life until some time in the future. They do not realize that there is no time between <em>believes</em> and <em>has.</em> From the moment we believe, we immediately have. As soon as we believe in the Lord, we have eternal life. After we believe, we do not need to wait, for even the slightest moment, to obtain eternal life. There is no need to wait for what we are immediately given.</p><h2 class="head2">Eternal Life Being Known in the Present Age</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:13).</p>
<p>In Christianity, many think and suggest that those who believe in the Lord cannot know whether or not they have eternal life in the present age. However, 1 John 5:13 clearly says that the Word of God, the Bible, enables us to know that we have eternal life. By the Word of God, the Bible, we can know that we have eternal life now.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Eternal Life and Never Perishing</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28-29).</p>
<p>Because the life we obtained is eternal, we will never perish. This life&rsquo;s eternal nature ensures that we will never perish. Moreover, once we have eternal life, we are in the hands of the Lord and the Father, so no one can snatch us away. We have the eternal life of God to uphold us inwardly, and we have the Lord&rsquo;s and the Father&rsquo;s hands to protect us outwardly. How can we perish?</p>
<h2 class="head1">OBTAINING ETERNAL LIFE IN THE COMING AGE</h2>
<p>Obtaining life in the coming age, which is the time of the millennial kingdom, is related only to the matter of reward in the kingdom age; it is not related to our eternal salvation.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;No one who has left...for My sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake, but that he shall receive a hundred times as much now at this time...and in the coming age, eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 10:29-30).</p>
<p>In these verses the Lord Jesus speaks of the present age and the coming age. The present age is the age today; it is the age of grace in which we live. The coming age is the next age; it is the age of the coming millennial kingdom. The Lord promised that if we leave everything for His sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake, we will obtain eternal life in the coming age. This shows that obtaining eternal life in the coming age is a reward for which we must pay a price, the price of leaving everything for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake. This is clearly different from obtaining eternal life immediately upon believing. Believing does not require anyone to pay a price, but in these verses the requirement to leave everything is an extremely high price. Previously, we gained eternal life by believing, but in these verses we will obtain eternal life in the coming age only if we leave everything. Therefore, this obtaining is not related to eternal salvation; instead, it is related to our reward in the coming kingdom age. This is because the eternal life that is spoken of in these verses is gained by leaving everything for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and for the gospel&rsquo;s sake, and it is gained in the coming age. According to the principle in the Bible, anything that requires us to pay a price now in order to receive it in the coming age is related to the reward in the millennial kingdom. Therefore, since obtaining eternal life in the coming age requires us to leave everything in this age, it must be related to the reward that the Lord gives in the millennial kingdom. This shows that the Lord especially designated the kingdom age as a period of enjoyment of eternal life as a reward for those who faithfully follow Him. All believers obtain and enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life in this age as soon as they believe in the Lord; however, only those who pay the price and faithfully follow the Lord will enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life in the coming age, the age of the millennial kingdom. In other words, anyone who believes can obtain eternal life in this age and enjoy it today, but only the faithful followers of the Lord who leave everything in this age will obtain and enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life in the coming age, the age of the millennial kingdom. The Lord ordained the enjoyment of eternal life in the millennial kingdom as a reward to those who leave everything for His sake today.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:10).</p>
<p>The Lord promises to give the crown of life to those who are faithful unto death. A crown is a symbol of the glory of reigning as a king. The crown of life is a symbol of the glory of reigning in life. Thus, for the Lord to give the crown of life means He gives the glory of reigning in life. The glory of reigning in life is given to those who are faithful unto death; it is bought at the price of being faithful unto death. This is not related to the free, gracious gift of eternal life obtained by faith in this age; rather, it is the reward of eternal life obtained in the coming age for paying the highest price. This reward is to enjoy the glory of reigning in life in the coming age. This will be in the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 2:7).</p>
<p>The Paradise of God spoken of here has the tree of life. Therefore, this Paradise must be the future New Jerusalem because the coming New Jerusalem has the tree of life (22:2). The New Jerusalem and all its blessings have been prepared for us by God and are for our enjoyment in eternity in the new heaven and new earth. In 2:7 the Lord promised that to eat of the fruit of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem would be a reward to the overcoming believers. The Bible teaches that the believers will be rewarded in the millennial kingdom. Therefore, this also indicates that the Lord will give the fruit of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem as a reward to the overcoming believers in the millennial kingdom. Although all believers will enjoy the New Jerusalem with its blessings in the new heaven and new earth, only the overcomers will have a foretaste of the fruit of the tree of life in the New Jerusalem during the millennial kingdom. To eat the fruit of the tree of life is to enjoy the blessing of eternal life, to enjoy eternal life itself. To have a foretaste of the fruit of the tree of life is to have an early enjoyment of the blessing of eternal life. This enjoyment of the blessing of eternal life is something every saved one will partake of in the new heaven and new earth. However, only the overcomers will enjoy the foretaste of the blessing of eternal life in the millennial kingdom. Before the coming of the new heaven and new earth, the Lord first gives the freshness of the blessing of eternal life, the fruit of the tree of life, as a reward to the overcomers as a foretaste and early enjoyment in the millennial kingdom. Thus, enjoying eternal life in the coming age is different from obtaining eternal life in the present age and enjoying eternal life in eternity.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;He who overcomes...I shall by no means erase his name out of the book of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 3:5).</p>
<p>As soon as we believe and obtain the Lord&rsquo;s life, our names are written in the book of life. The Lord&rsquo;s life is the eternal life, so if we obtain the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life, we will never perish (John 10:28). According to the Lord&rsquo;s promise in Revelation 3:5, the names of the overcoming believers will not be erased from the book of life. Obtaining eternal life by faith and not perishing in eternity have no requirements related to overcoming. But the Lord&rsquo;s promise to not erase our names from the book of life has the requirement of overcoming. Therefore, this verse is related to the matter of <em>reward,</em> not to the <em>gift of grace.</em> A gift is given freely, but a reward has requirements. Since this is a reward, it is related to the millennial kingdom. With respect to eternal salvation, no saved person can perish; with respect to the reward of the millennial kingdom, only overcoming believers will enjoy the blessing of having their names in the book of life during the millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>These passages of the Bible all speak of enjoying eternal life in the kingdom age. This is the section of the reward of eternal life, which is different from the section of the gracious gift of eternal life. The gift is free; the reward is earned.</p><h2 class="head1">ENJOYING ETERNAL LIFE IN ETERNITY</h2>
<p>The enjoyment of eternal life in eternity in the new heaven and new earth is the full enjoyment of God&rsquo;s salvation, which all the saved ones will share in eternity.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (John 4:14).</p>
<p>The water the Lord gives is His life. This life will become a fountain of water in us, springing up and flowing us into eternal life. Thus, we will enjoy the blessing of eternal life in eternity.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Enter into it, but only those who are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:27).</p>
<p>The full blessing of God&rsquo;s salvation is the coming New Jerusalem, which is given to all the saved ones for their enjoyment in eternity. All those who have the Lord&rsquo;s eternal life and whose names are written in the Lamb&rsquo;s book of life will participate in this blessing. All those who have received eternal life by faith will enter into the New Jerusalem based on this life and enjoy the blessings of eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 21:6; see also 22:1).</p>
<p>All the saved ones will enjoy the blessings of eternal life in the New Jerusalem, and one of these blessings will be the water of life. This water flows out from the throne of God and refers to God&rsquo;s ever-living life. All the saved ones will eternally drink of this water of life and eternally enjoy God&rsquo;s ever-living life.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;They may have right to the tree of life&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 22:14).</p>
<p>All the saved ones will enjoy the blessings of the New Jerusalem, including another blessing&mdash;the tree of life. The water of life indicates that the life of God will eternally quench our thirst, and the tree of life indicates that the life of God will eternally satisfy our hunger. Therefore, in eternity future we will enjoy God&rsquo;s ever-living life, causing us to never hunger or thirst. This will be our enjoyment of eternal life in eternity.</p>
<p>In this age we obtain eternal life as soon as we believe. After obtaining eternal life, we can enjoy it and live by it. If we live for the Lord today by the power of this eternal life, we will be overcomers. Then during the coming kingdom age, we will reign in life together with the Lord, we will enjoy the glory of life, and we will have a foretaste of the blessings of eternity. Finally, when eternity arrives, we, who have received eternal life through salvation, will enjoy the blessings of eternal life in the New Jerusalem for eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">RELEASE&mdash;FREEDOM</h1>
<p>Release enables us to have freedom. When we were sinners, we were under all kinds of bondage. The Lord came to save us and to deliver us from bondage so that we might obtain release and freedom. Therefore, release&mdash;freedom&mdash;is one of the blessings of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivers us not merely from sin and death but also from bondage; it enables us to obtain not only justification and life but also release, freedom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BONDAGE OF THE UNBELIEVERS</h2>
<p>Every worldly person, no matter how high his education, how high his social position, or how good his behavior, is a person under bondage. If he has not received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation by faith, he is under some form of bondage, and he has no freedom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Under Sin</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:34; see also Rom. 6:17).</p>
<p>The first kind of bondage that people fall under is the bondage of sin. People are like slaves under sin. The Greek word for <em>slave</em> denotes a person sold into slavery. One who is sold into slavery is entirely under the control of his master and has no freedom whatever. People under sin are slaves of sin; they are controlled by sin and mastered by sin to the extent that they have no control over their sins.</p>
<p>People think that sin is merely a wrong action or bad behavior, but the Bible speaks of sin as a living thing within man. It has the authority and power to make people its slaves, causing them to commit all kinds of sins. Just as slaves must obey their masters, people under the control of sin cannot control themselves in the matter of committing sins.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;They themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom anyone has been defeated, by this one he has been enslaved&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 2:19).</p>
<p>Sin controls people and causes everything they do to be corrupt. Therefore, anyone who does corrupt things is a slave of corruption and cannot be free. Corrupt things, such as eating, drinking, womanizing, gambling, and smoking, control countless people and cause them to lose their freedom. Many are controlled like slaves to eating, drinking, womanizing, gambling, and smoking. Even though their reasonable mind does not agree with these things, they are powerless to refrain from them.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;But I am...sold under sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:14).</p>
<p>Man is sold under sin. He is sold as a slave to sin. He is under the authority, control, and bondage of sin. He cannot be free.</p>
<h2 class="head2">In the Self</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from the body of this death?&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:23-24).</p>
<p>In man, that is, in his body, there is a law that wars with his desire to do good and takes him captive against this desire, forcing him to do all kinds of evil and wrong things against his will. This law in man&rsquo;s body is a spontaneous power that captures him and forces him to do the evil he does not will to do. Under this law, man cannot decide for himself and cannot be free.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Under the Hand of Satan</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Lies in the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:19; see also Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>Satan controls and acts upon man. Today all people are under his authority and control. They lie in the evil one, and having no freedom, they are acted upon by him. People lie under his hand. He acts upon them like a doctor operating on patients under anesthesia, having no control over the doctor&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The snare of the devil, having been caught alive by him&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 2:26).</p>
<p>Today man has been caught alive by the devil and is trapped in his snare, having no freedom and ability to free himself. The devil is very tricky. He captures people without their knowledge. Even though they think they are released and free, he ensnares people. The truth, however, is that all people have been caught by the devil without their knowledge, regardless of whether they are officials, farmers, laborers, businessmen, males, females, old, or young. They are in his snare, and they cannot escape by themselves.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Whom Satan has bound&rdquo;; &ldquo;Oppressed by the devil&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 13:16; Acts 10:38).</p>
<p>Satan uses many things, such as sin, money, and pleasure, to seduce people and take them captive. He also uses sickness and sufferings to bind and oppress people, making it impossible for them to be free. People are either seduced, captured, and enslaved to sin, evil, money, and pleasure or they are oppressed and cannot be free from the bondage of suffering and sickness. This is how Satan treats people.</p><h2 class="head2">Under Judgment, Condemnation,<br />
Wrath, and Death</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Fall under the judgment of God&rdquo;; &ldquo;Has been condemned already&rdquo;; &ldquo;The wrath of God abides upon him&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:19; John 3:18, 36).</p>
<p>Everyone is a sinner before God; they are waiting for death under God&rsquo;s judgment, condemnation, and wrath. God&rsquo;s righteous wrath is waiting to burst forth like thunder because of man&rsquo;s sins before Him. His wrath will eventually explode upon the world. Anyone who has not repented, believed in the Lord, and been forgiven will be unable to escape this wrath.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;It is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment&rdquo;; &ldquo;Who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 9:27; 2:15).</p>
<p>Everyone is sinful, so everyone will die. After death comes judgment; this is the fate that sinners cannot escape. People may be able to escape from other things, but no one can escape from death. Who does not wish to escape from death? But who can? Death is a fate over which no one has a choice, and this fate makes everyone fearful. Anyone who thinks of death or faces death feels that death is terrible. Who is truly not afraid to die? Man&rsquo;s entire life is under the shadow of death, in the fear of it, and under its control. Man is a slave under its power without any freedom. Because of man&rsquo;s fear of death, he often voluntarily gives up his freedom, doing many things that bring him into bondage. Death really is a power and a bondage.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Under Hardships, Anxiety, and Deceitfulness</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;All who toil and are burdened&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 11:28).</p>
<p>Every worldly person toils and is burdened; no one has a heart that is completely at rest and comfortable. Moreover, most toil and burdens are impossible to escape or avoid.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 13:22).</p>
<p>The anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches are worries and bondages from which it is difficult to be released. Many are plagued with anxieties and cannot rise above them; many others are deceived by riches and cannot overcome them. The anxiety of the age and the deceitfulness of riches have ensnared countless people, trapping them in hardships and causing them to lose their freedom and self-determination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FREEDOM OF THE BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>The believers have been saved by the Lord and released by Him from all kinds of bondage to obtain freedom. Obtaining freedom is related to two time periods&mdash;one is in the present, and one is in the future. In the present, believers obtain and enjoy freedom. In the future, the believers also will obtain and enjoy freedom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Already Obtained and Currently Being Enjoyed</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Freedom from Judgment, Condemnation,<br />
Wrath, and Death</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood&rdquo;</strong> (Rev. 1:5; see also Titus 2:14).</p>
<p>The Lord shed His blood to redeem us from our sins, cleansing us and releasing us from our sins so that we no longer have the problem of sins. All the troubles that come to us from our sins were resolved by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, which has released us from them. Since the Lord&rsquo;s blood has released us from our sins, it also has released us from judgment, condemnation, wrath, and death which are related to sins.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He who believes into Him is not condemned&rdquo;; &ldquo;Has passed out of death into life&rdquo;</strong> (John 3:18; 5:24).</p>
<p>In the past, we were condemned before God because of our sins. Now we are released from our sins by faith, and we are no longer condemned. In the past we fell into death because of sin, and we were dying&mdash;even dead&mdash;people. Since our sins have been forgiven, we have passed out of death into life. We have been released from the threat of condemnation and the power of death.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Christ has redeemed us out of the curse of the law, having become a curse on our behalf&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:13).</p>
<p>Our sins brought us under the curse of God&rsquo;s righteous law, making us those who should perish and die. However, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, the Lord was cursed by the law in our place. He redeemed us out of the curse of the law, which we could not get out of by ourselves. This releases us and gives us freedom.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 1:10).</p>
<p>In the past God&rsquo;s righteous wrath was waiting to explode upon us because of our sins. Since the Lord Jesus suffered the punishment of God&rsquo;s wrath in our place, according to God&rsquo;s righteousness, He thoroughly redeemed us from our sins and released us from God&rsquo;s coming wrath. Believers will not have to face the wrath that unbelievers will be unable to escape.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil, and might release those who because of the fear of death through all their life were held in slavery&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 2:14-15).</p>
<p>Through His death on the cross, the Lord destroyed him who has the might of death, that is, the devil, and released us, who were being held in slavery because of the fear of death. This released us from the control of death and gave us freedom.</p><h2 class="head3">From the Power of Sin</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He...will save His people from their sins&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 1:21).</p>
<p>We were drowning in sin and could not rescue ourselves; the Lord came to save us from our sins, making us free and happy.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:36).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that people today strongly promote freedom and want to enjoy freedom, everyone is under the bondage of sin; their spirit and conscience do not have freedom. When a person enjoys sin and casts off restraint, it seems as if he is following the desires of his heart, but actually he is going against them and contradicting his conscience to be a slave and captive of sin. He does not have true freedom. He is a slave until he receives the Lord Jesus as his Savior. Then he obtains true freedom in his heart, spirit, and conscience. The Lord Jesus is the Son of God, and the life of God is in Him. When a person receives Him as his Savior, the life of God within the Lord enters into him to be the power for his human life, freeing him from the power of sin and giving him freedom.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The truth shall set you free&rdquo;</strong> (John 8:32).</p>
<p><em>The truth</em> in this verse is the Lord&rsquo;s word (v. 31), which is the Lord Himself (14:6). The Lord and His word are found in the Bible, so the Bible can set us free. If we read the Bible frequently, we will know and obtain the truth in it. This truth, which is the Lord Himself and His word, will free us from sin and its bondage, making us free indeed.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Our old man has been crucified with Him in order...that we should no longer serve sin as slaves&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:6-7).</p>
<p>God tells us in His Word, the Bible, that our sinful old man with its sins has been crucified with Christ and has died with Christ. A dead person is spontaneously free from sin. Since we died with the Lord, we were freed from sin and are no longer slaves to sin. By the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross on our behalf, we escape the punishment of sin; by our death with the Lord on the cross, we are delivered from the enslavement of sin. The Lord&rsquo;s cross saved us from these two aspects of sin and made us free.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Sin will not lord it over you&rdquo;; &ldquo;Having been freed from sin&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:14, 22, see also v. 18).</p>
<p>We were crucified and resurrected together with the Lord Jesus, so we are no longer under the law but under grace; therefore, sin can no longer lord it over us. The more an unbeliever relies on himself to keep God&rsquo;s law, the more he feels sin lording it over him, and the more he is unable to escape the power of sin. When he receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and life, he will see that his old man was crucified with the Lord. Then he will stop trying to keep God&rsquo;s law by himself, and instead, he will enjoy the grace of God by the Lord&rsquo;s life. In this way, he lives under grace, not the law. Having been freed from sin, sin cannot lord it over him. The Lord&rsquo;s grace causes us to have His life, to be joined to Him, and to be crucified with Him, so we do not have to keep the law of God in ourselves. We can enjoy God&rsquo;s grace by His life and escape the power of sin, having been freed from sin.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:2).</p>
<p>When we are saved, we receive the Spirit of life. In the Spirit of life there is a law, which is a spontaneous spiritual power that frees us from the law of sin and of death, meaning that it frees us from the spontaneous power of sin and of death. In the past, the law of sin and of death was a spontaneous power within us, preventing us from escaping sin and death. Now God has placed the Spirit of life in us as another law, a spontaneous power, that nullifies the law of sin and of death and nullifies the spontaneous power of sin and of death. This frees us from the law of sin and of death, causing us to escape sin and death and giving us real freedom.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:1-2).</p>
<p><em>No condemnation</em> does not refer to having our sins forgiven but to being freed from sin; that is, there is no condemnation within ourselves (cf. 7:23-24). In the past, we condemned ourselves because we could not overcome the law of sin; instead, we were continually captured by sin to do evil. Since the law of the Spirit of life has freed us from the law of sin, we are no longer overcome by sin and no longer condemn ourselves. This release within our being makes us bold and free.</p><h2 class="head3">From the Self, the Flesh, and the Old Man</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;In the putting off of the body of the flesh&rdquo;; &ldquo;You have put off the old man&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:11; 3:9).</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s strongest bondage and entanglements come from his flesh and the old man. From these there is no escape for those who are not saved. However, in Christ those who are saved have escaped the flesh and the old man. The Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection enables them to put off the flesh and the old man. The Lord&rsquo;s life of death and resurrection enables them to experience this putting off and to no longer be bound by the flesh or be under the bondage of the old man.</p>
<h2 class="head3">From the Law</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;God sent forth His Son...born under law, that He might redeem those under law&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 4:4-5).</p>
<p>Our sins place us under God&rsquo;s law. God&rsquo;s law is righteous, and it places righteous requirements upon those who are unrighteous and sinful. If we do not fulfill the righteous requirements of the law, we cannot escape the curse of the law. The Lord Jesus came and paid the price for us on the cross, fulfilling the righteous requirements of the law and redeeming us out from under the law to release us from the law and its curse and to give us freedom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;We have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 7:6; see also Gal. 2:19).</p>
<p>In the past, we were under the law and bound by the law. Through faith in Christ, we have escaped the law. Christ was put to death as our Substitute. He paid the entire price required by the law, redeeming us out from under the law and releasing us from the condemnation of the law. In terms of our union with Christ, we were included in His death, causing us to die to the law which bound us and releasing us from the bondage of the law. The law cannot lord it over those who are dead; they are released from its control. Because we died together with Him, we have been released from the control of the law and are no longer responsible to it.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 6:14).</p>
<p>In the past, we were under the condemnation of the law and under the control of the law. The Lord Jesus died in our place to redeem us from the condemnation of the law, or from the condemning law. He also brought us to die with Him, releasing us from the control of the law, or from the controlling law. Then He made us live together with Him in resurrection, giving us His life and enabling us to live under God&rsquo;s grace. Therefore, we are no longer controlled under law; rather, we are free under grace.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;For freedom...Christ has set us free...Do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:1).</p>
<p>The words <em>freedom</em> and <em>set...free</em> refer to being set free from the law and being given freedom. In the past, we were under the law and entangled with a yoke of slavery. Christ released us through His redemption and set us free from the yoke of the law, giving us freedom.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;So then you are no longer a slave but a son&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 4:7).</p>
<p>A person under the law is like a slave without freedom. When he receives the Son of God, the Lord Jesus, as his Savior, the Spirit of sonship enters into him and gives him the life of God, making him God&rsquo;s son and giving him freedom.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;You were called for freedom&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:13).</p>
<p>Because we sinned, we fell under the bondage of the law. God came and called us to receive His salvation and thus released us from the bondage of the law and gave us freedom.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 2:4).</p>
<p>A person under the law is a slave to ordinances and is bound by the letter; after he receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, he becomes a son of God in Christ and enjoys the freedom of life.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>The letter of the law places people under bondage, but the Spirit of the Lord frees them. Before a person is saved, he does not have the Spirit of the Lord; consequently, he is under the bondage of the letter of the law. When we were saved, we received the Spirit of the Lord; consequently, the Spirit of the Lord freed us from the bondage of the letter of the law, giving us freedom.</p><h2 class="head3">From Satan</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Release to the captives,...and...release those who are oppressed&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 4:18; cf. Acts 10:38).</p>
<p>In the past, we were Satan&rsquo;s captives under his oppression. The death of the Lord on the cross destroyed Satan and released us from under his hand, giving us freedom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who delivered us out of the authority of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of the Son of His love&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:13; see also Acts 26:18).</p>
<p>Satan has a kingdom, and he controls all the people in his kingdom. The authority of darkness in Colossians 1:13 is the kingdom of Satan. When we were sinners, we were in his kingdom of darkness and under his authority and cruel control. When we believed and received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation through His Holy Spirit of power and His resurrection life, the Lord delivered us out of the kingdom of darkness, that is, out from under Satan&rsquo;s authority. He also transferred us into His own kingdom of light, making us His children of light who enjoy freedom in the light.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 3:3; see also John 17:15; Matt. 6:13).</p>
<p>Satan is evil, so the Bible calls him the evil one. In the past we were ill-treated and corrupted under his hand. The Lord delivered us out from under his hand, and He will also establish us and guard us from him. This was the Lord&rsquo;s prayer for us as He was about to leave the world, and it should be our frequent prayer. God is faithful, and He will accomplish this thing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">From the World</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:4).</p>
<p>The present evil age is the part of the world that is before our eyes; it is used by Satan to seduce, cheat, and control people. In the past, we were under the seduction of the present evil age, we were tricked by Satan to come under his control, and we were unable to keep ourselves from following the customs and fashions of this evil age. The Lord offered Himself up and accomplished redemption not only to deliver us from sin and Satan but also to deliver us from the present evil age, which is the world under Satan&rsquo;s hand. He delivers us out of the customs and fashions of this evil age so that we may have freedom.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You died with Christ from the elements of the world&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 2:20).</p>
<p>The elements of the world are the religious ordinances and philosophies of the world (cf. vv. 8, 21-22). Satan, through human wisdom and cleverness, invented the religions, ordinances, and philosophies in the world to keep men in bondage. Since we are joined to the Lord and died together with Him to escape the world, we were also delivered from the bondage of worldly religions, ordinances, and philosophies. Now we enjoy the freedom of His salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 1:4).</p>
<p>The world is filled with all kinds of corruption. This corruption comes from human lusts. People live in corruption and give their lusts free rein. Before we were saved, we lived in our lusts and could not stop ourselves from fulfilling them. When the Lord saved us with the life of God, we were delivered from the corruption which is in the world by lust. Now we enjoy freedom in God&rsquo;s holy nature.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;You were redeemed from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:18-19).</p>
<p>The vain manner of life of the people of the world has been handed down from their fathers. It has been passed on from generation to generation, so it is hard to escape. The redemption accomplished by the Lord on the cross and the precious blood He shed brought us back to God. This delivered us from the vain manner of life in the world passed on to us through the generations. We have been freed to live in God&rsquo;s holiness.</p><h2 class="head3">From All Kinds of Troubles</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 5:7; see also Psa. 55:22; Phil. 4:6-7; Matt. 6:25-34).</p>
<p>Men on earth are full of anxiety. They worry about their food and clothing, their health, their future, their children, and many more things. They have no way and no place to go to rid themselves of their anxiety. They can only gain more anxiety; they cannot rid themselves of anxiety. Anxiety is a great entanglement and oppression to humans. However, when we are saved and become children of God, we can cast all our anxiety on Him. By means of prayer and petition, we can cast all our anxiety upon God. Prayer and petition are the means for casting off our anxiety, and God is the place where we can cast it. When we make known our anxieties to God by means of prayer and petition, when we cast our anxiety on Him, inwardly our entire being is unburdened. We are so comfortable, so happy. When we cast all our anxiety on God, He is willing to receive it. He is willing to bear it for us because it matters to Him concerning us. <em>Matters to Him concerning you</em> can be translated &ldquo;He cares for you.&rdquo; God cares for us. At all times and in all places, by means of prayer and petition, we should cast our anxiety and burdens on God to free ourselves of the entanglement and oppression of anxiety so that we can be free and happy.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Lord is my Helper&rdquo;; &ldquo;Jehovah is...my salvation; / Whom shall I fear?&rdquo;; &ldquo;There is no fear in love&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 13:6; Psa. 27:1; 1 John 4:18).</p>
<p>Fear is also something people cannot avoid; it is a suffering that is hard to overcome. Who lives in the world without fear? Who can overcome fear? Some fear illness, some fear death, some fear failing in school, some fear losing money in business, and some fear that their children will become bad. If a person is not afraid of one thing, he is afraid of another thing. He is afraid of this life, and he is afraid of the next. People are afraid of many things in the present and in the future because they have lost God. God is man&rsquo;s Protector; He is the One on whom they can rely. Without God, man has no protection and nothing on which to rely, so he can only know fear. But those who are saved have God as their Helper and salvation, so they can overcome fear. Since God is our Helper, what shall we fear? Since God is our salvation, whom shall we fear? When we have God, we have no fear. As we continue to love God, we will become even more fearless and bold because we will escape the suffering from fear.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of trial&rdquo;; &ldquo;God...will, with the temptation, also make the way out&rdquo;</strong> (2 Pet. 2:9; 1 Cor. 10:13).</p>
<p>The world is filled with temptations that trap people in sin or cause people to fall. Very few people can meet, overcome, and escape these temptations. But the Lord delivers us out of temptation. If we fear the Lord and live a godly life in Him, whenever we meet with temptation, the Lord will deliver us. When we are tempted, the Lord knows we need His salvation, and He also knows how to save us. Therefore, when we are tempted, He makes a way out for us to escape the troubling temptation so that we can be released.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 11:28; see also Heb. 12:1).</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we were always toiling and burdened, so we had no rest for our souls. But once we come to the Lord and receive Him as our Savior, He takes our burdens and gives us rest to comfort our souls.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;I have learned, in whatever circumstances I am, to be content&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 4:11-13; see also 1 Tim. 6:8; Heb. 13:5).</p>
<p>Worldly people do not have God as their support and satisfaction, so they are greedy for countless things in their lives. No matter the circumstances, they are never content. Their avarice troubles them and prohibits them from finding rest. But we belong to God, and we have Him as our support and satisfaction. Therefore, we do not need to be greedy for the necessities of life, and we can be content in any circumstance. This enables us to escape the troubling of avarice and to enjoy the happiness of contentment and blessing that comes from not being greedy.</p><h2 class="head2">To Be Obtained in the Future</h2>
<h2 class="head3">From the Corruption of the Old Creation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;For the anxious watching of the creation...the creation was made subject to vanity...in hope that the creation itself will also be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God...We ourselves groan in ourselves, eagerly awaiting sonship, the redemption of our body&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:19-23).</p>
<p>Although the Lord&rsquo;s salvation released us from slavery, bondage, and troubles and gave us the enjoyment of freedom, there is a form of slavery in us that will remain until the Lord returns and His salvation delivers us fully. This slavery is the slavery of the corruption of the old creation which comes to us through our body. Even though our spirit has been regenerated to become part of the new creation, our outward body is still part of the old creation. This body of the old creation is subject to vanity and is under the slavery of corruption; it groans and travails together with the entire old creation. Therefore, we have release and freedom in the spirit, but often our body is still in slavery and under corruption. Many times our body becomes weak, sick, crippled, and aged, so it brings us into bondage from which we cannot be freed. At such times, we feel the slavery of the corruption of the old creation and its vanity. We do, however, have the hope that when the Lord returns, He will use His power, by which all things are subjected, to transfigure our body of humiliation, which is subject to the slavery of the corruption of the old creation, into a glorious body (Phil. 3:20-21). This will be the redemption of our body. Although at the time of our salvation our spirit obtained the freedom of the new creation, our body must wait until the Lord&rsquo;s return before it can experience the Lord&rsquo;s redemption and escape the slavery of the old creation. At that time, our body will be transfigured into a glorious body just like the Lord&rsquo;s glorious body, and it will be entirely in the new creation with the glorious freedom of the new creation. The glorious freedom of the new creation that God has prepared for us has not been seen or heard or even come up in man&rsquo;s heart (1 Cor. 2:9). We will obtain the glorious freedom of the new creation and obtain the sonship of the children of God. Although today we have the life of the Son of God and have become sons of God, we will not obtain the sonship of God until the Lord&rsquo;s return. This sonship, which is the redemption of our bodies, delivers our entire being&mdash;spirit, soul, and body&mdash;from within to without to fully release us from the old creation and the slavery of the corruption of the old creation so that we may enter the new creation and the glorious freedom of the new creation. Only this freedom is complete, absolute, glorious, divine, and therefore perfect, without any defect or lack. This is because this freedom is the freedom of God Himself and the freedom of God&rsquo;s glory. At that time we and God will be in His glory together, enjoying His glorious freedom. As He is in glory, we also will be in glory. As He transcends all things, is above all things, and is perfectly free, we also will transcend all things, be above all things, and be utterly free. This is the sonship we will obtain. Hallelujah! Praise Him! Hallelujah! Praise Him for this marvelous salvation! How transcendent and glorious!</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Law of Freedom</h2>
<p>The release we obtain in the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is a freedom, but this freedom does not imply looseness; it is a regulated freedom. Although this release is freedom, it has a law.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Do not turn this freedom into an opportunity for the flesh&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:13).</p>
<p>Although the Lord&rsquo;s salvation releases us from the bondage of the law and gives us freedom, we cannot turn this freedom into an opportunity for the flesh. If we turn the freedom we have obtained into an opportunity for the flesh, what appears to be freedom will only be another form of captivity and slavery to lusts. True freedom is not subject to the bondage of the law, and it is not a slave to lusts. It transcends all things without giving opportunity to the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;As free, and yet not having freedom as a covering for evil, but as slaves of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 2:16).</p>
<p>The freedom of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivers us from all bondage so that we may serve God; we cannot use it as an excuse or a covering for evil. The more we are released from bondage and obtain freedom, the more we are God&rsquo;s slaves. As we are restricted and regulated by God, serving others willingly for their benefit, we will offer no covering for evil, do nothing bad, and harm no one.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Beware lest somehow this right of yours become a stumbling block to the weak ones&rdquo;; &ldquo;Why is my freedom judged by some other conscience?&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 8:9; 10:29).</p>
<p>We who were saved by the Lord are absolutely free and have no regulations or religious ordinances restricting us. But for the sake of others, for the weak ones, we should gladly be restricted in all matters. Concerning the matter of eating sacrifices offered to idols, they are nothing and can be eaten. But some brothers and sisters do not have this spiritual knowledge. Their consciences are weak, and if they see us eating something that was sacrificed to idols and then eat an idol sacrifice themselves, it will put a spot on their weak conscience and stumble them. Therefore, for the sake of the weak brothers and sisters, we should be restricted and not eat loosely so that our freedom does not become a stumbling block to them. This is not only true in the matter of eating but in other things as well. Although we are free in the Lord and are able to do many things, not all things build up others and some things may even stumble others. Therefore, we should restrict ourselves and not do them for the sake of others. If we love the Lord and the brothers and sisters, there should be many things that we would not do for the sake of the brothers and sisters. Often, for the profit of the brothers and sisters, we cannot wear certain clothes, say certain things, go to certain places, or live in certain ways. For the sake of the brothers and sisters, we cannot do anything that causes them to be concerned, to have questions, or to become critical, even if it does not involve sin and is clean. Despite the fact that we are free, we should be restricted for the sake of the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;For though I am free from all, I have enslaved myself to all that I might gain the more&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:19).</p>
<p>Although Paul was free and could do all things with no one controlling him, he willingly enslaved himself to others and was restricted in all things for the sake of turning others to the Lord. After receiving the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, we can enjoy absolute freedom, but we should be restricted in all things because we love the Lord, because we love others&rsquo; souls, and because we want the Lord to gain more people. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation makes people free, but those who have obtained the Lord&rsquo;s salvation are willing to be restricted by the Lord. The more we enjoy the freedom of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, the more we enjoy being restricted for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. Truly, the more we are restricted for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, the more we enjoy real freedom.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;I am not without law to God but within law to Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 9:21).</p>
<p>Although in other passages of the Bible Paul strongly asserts that those who are saved have been released from the law and are not under the law, he says in 1 Corinthians 9:21 that he was not without law to God but within law to Christ. Although he received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, was delivered from the bondage of the law, and had obtained freedom, he was not loose before God. He was restricted in the Lord for the sake of serving God and the Lord. Although he was delivered from the law of letters, God Himself was Paul&rsquo;s law. Although he was released from the ordinances of the law, the Lord Himself was Paul&rsquo;s regulation. He was walking before God and could not act loosely. He lived before the Lord and could not live loosely. He was governed by God in every matter and was restricted by the Lord in everything. This is the proper condition of one who is saved and who has obtained freedom. The normal condition of those who have received grace and are saved is that they are not loose, even though they are free. We should not be without law; rather, we should move and act before God under God&rsquo;s governing, and we should live in the Lord under His restriction. Although we are not under the law, we live before God; although we are not in the letter, we are in the Lord. Although we do not have the restriction of the law, we have God&rsquo;s governing; although we do not have the bondage of the ordinances, we have the Lord&rsquo;s restricting. This is absolute freedom, but it is also an absolute restriction.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The law of freedom&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:25; 2:12).</p>
<p>The law of freedom is the commands and teachings in the New Testament. The Old Testament law is the law of letters outside of man, so what it commands and requires of man is the opposite of man&rsquo;s fallen nature and will. Therefore, it makes man feel that he is under bondage. The commandments and teachings in the New Testament are the Lord&rsquo;s word of life. Even though they are outside of us, their nature is the same as the new nature and new tendencies, which we have received from the Lord&rsquo;s word and life. Thus, they cause us to obtain inward freedom. By receiving the Lord&rsquo;s word, we were regenerated inwardly to have a new nature whose taste is to delight in what is commanded and taught in the Lord&rsquo;s Word. The more we keep the commandments and teachings in the Lord&rsquo;s Word, the more our new inward nature feels comfortable and free. The commandments and teachings of the Lord&rsquo;s Word foster our new nature within, releasing and freeing it. These commandments and teachings are the law that enables this new inward nature to be free, for they are identical to the law of life in our new nature. We who have the new nature should not be under the bondage of the Old Testament law of letters; rather, we should live in the New Testament law of life, which is the law of freedom.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">SALVATION</h1>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation includes all the topics we previously covered, such as forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, reconciliation, regeneration, eternal life, release, and other such blessings. A person who receives these heavenly blessings in Christ is saved. However, in the Bible God speaks of at least five kinds of salvation, and if we do not clearly distinguish between these five kinds of salvation, we will be confused about what the Bible says about salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ETERNAL SALVATION</h2>
<p>The first kind of salvation spoken of in the Bible is eternal salvation. We receive this salvation at the time we believe; it includes the enlivening of our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Source</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;By grace you have been saved through faith, and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works that no one should boast&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:8-9).</p>
<p>The salvation spoken of here is eternal salvation, and it refers to our spirit being enlivened (cf. v. 5). This is by God&rsquo;s grace. Because of His love, God gave us grace; this grace is the source of our eternal salvation. The source of our eternal salvation is the grace that comes from God&rsquo;s love; in other words, grace issues in our eternal salvation. Since our eternal salvation does not come from ourselves or our works, no one can boast; it is the gift of God. Our works have absolutely nothing to do with eternal salvation. If our works could gain eternal salvation for us, it would be easy for us to boast in ourselves. Since God&rsquo;s grace is the source of our eternal salvation, we can only praise Him for His grace and give glory to Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who has saved us...not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9).</p>
<p>God saved us according to His own purpose and grace, not according to our works. Our salvation is unrelated to our works; it is entirely according to God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Not out of works in righteousness which we did but according to His mercy He saved us&rdquo;</strong> (Titus 3:5).</p>
<p>God gave us eternal salvation according to His mercy. His giving had absolutely nothing to do with any works in righteousness which we did. According to our real condition, we did not have any works in righteousness, and what is more, we were so full of sin that we were unworthy of God&rsquo;s grace. Thank God not only for His grace but also for His mercy. His mercy caused His grace to reach us even when we were unworthy of salvation. His grace prepared salvation for us, and His mercy caused His salvation to reach us.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Through the grace of the Lord Jesus we are saved&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 15:11).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s saving grace reaches us through the Lord Jesus (John 1:17). Through this grace He accomplished salvation for us and completed all the things necessary for our salvation. Our salvation is through His grace, not our works.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Foundation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Jesus...will save His people&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 1:21).</p>
<p>The source of our eternal salvation is God&rsquo;s grace, and the foundation of our eternal salvation is the Lord Jesus Himself. He is God incarnated to be our Savior. <em>Jesus,</em> the Greek form of the Hebrew <em>Joshua</em> (Num. 13:16), means &ldquo;Jehovah Savior&rdquo; or &ldquo;the salvation of Jehovah.&rdquo; As our Savior, His name is Jesus. He is named Jehovah because He came to save us. He is Jehovah coming to be our Savior; He is God Himself coming as our salvation. Without Him, even God&rsquo;s grace cannot save us. God&rsquo;s grace, which accomplishes salvation, comes through Him. He is the means of God&rsquo;s salvation, the foundation of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A Savior, Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 13:23; see also Luke 2:11).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the Savior established by God, so He is the foundation of our salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Grace...has been manifested through...our Savior Christ Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9-10).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace in saving us was manifested through the Lord Jesus. Although God has grace, it could not have been manifested without Christ.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:9).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the door to God&rsquo;s salvation. People must pass through Him to enter into God&rsquo;s salvation. Whoever enters through Him participates in God&rsquo;s salvation and is saved.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;There is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 4:12).</p>
<p>While there are sages and heroes among men, there is no Savior other than the Lord Jesus. Apart from Him there is no salvation. There is no name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved other than the precious name of Jesus. Only the Lord Jesus is the Savior established by God. He is God Himself coming as our Savior. Only He is the foundation of our salvation. His name is the only reliable name in the universe that saves people.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 1:15; see also Luke 19:10).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was God in the heavens. He was incarnated to be a man because He wanted to be the Savior of sinners. Therefore, Christ Jesus, who is God become man, is the foundation and means by which sinners are saved.</p><h2 class="head2">Its Way</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Faith</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;By grace you have been saved through faith&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:8).</p>
<p>We are saved by God&rsquo;s grace through faith. Even though God has grace, it is not possible for us to be saved if we do not have faith. God&rsquo;s grace prepared salvation for us, but our faith obtains what God prepared and accomplished for us. God&rsquo;s grace gives us salvation, and our faith receives God&rsquo;s gift. If God&rsquo;s grace was prepared but not obtained through our faith and if God&rsquo;s grace was given but not received through our faith, God&rsquo;s salvation could not come to us. In order to obtain God&rsquo;s salvation, we must use our faith to receive it. Faith is the way we obtain God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Your faith has saved you&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 7:50).</p>
<p>Although the Lord&rsquo;s grace comes to save us, our faith causes the Lord&rsquo;s grace to come upon us and to be efficacious in us. Therefore, subjectively speaking, our faith saves us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Salvation to everyone who believes&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:16).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that God desires all men to be saved, His salvation can only save those who believe. Faith is the way that man causes God&rsquo;s salvation to reach him.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Believe and be saved&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 8:12).</p>
<p>Faith is the way required for salvation. Once a person believes, he is saved.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 16:31).</p>
<p>There is no way to receive God&rsquo;s salvation except through faith. There is no other path to the Lord&rsquo;s salvation except faith. Once a person believes, he is saved.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Calling</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 10:13; see also Acts 2:21).</p>
<p>When a person believes in the Lord, he spontaneously calls on the Lord (Rom. 10:14). Although we cannot see the Lord, we can call on His name. The Lord&rsquo;s name is the Lord Himself. Therefore, to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name is to call on the Lord Himself. This is the reason that those who call upon the name of the Lord are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Confession</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;With the mouth there is confession unto salvation&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 10:10).</p>
<p>If a person believes in the Lord, he must confess the Lord. To believe is to believe in one&rsquo;s heart that Jesus is the Savior, and to confess is to confess with the mouth that Jesus is Lord. Faith is in one&rsquo;s heart before God, while confession is with one&rsquo;s mouth before others. Before God, we are saved as soon as we believe in our heart, but we must confess with our mouth before others to show that we have believed and are saved. If we believe in our heart but do not confess with our mouth, we will have a problem before both God and man. If we want a thorough salvation before both God and man, we must believe with our heart and confess with our mouth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Baptism</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 16:16).</p>
<p>This passage does not say, &ldquo;He who believes shall be saved.&rdquo; It says, &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo; Faith is related to salvation, and baptism is related to salvation. Believing is inward; it involves a person&rsquo;s exercise of faith to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. Baptism is outward; it involves a person&rsquo;s acknowledgment of receiving the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. Believing and being baptized are one complete step for receiving the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation. If one merely believes without being baptized, he has taken only half a step toward the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation. There are many elements to the Lord&rsquo;s salvation; some are received by faith, and some are obtained through baptism. If we merely believe without being baptized, we can receive only part of the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation. If we want to receive God&rsquo;s full salvation, we must believe and be baptized.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Which water, as the antitype, also now saves you, that is, baptism...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 3:21).</p>
<p>Noah and his household of eight entered the ark and were saved from the destruction of the flood. Inside the ark they also passed through the flood and were saved by the flood from the corrupt generation that rebelled against God. Similarly, we have entered into Christ through faith and have escaped the judgment of God&rsquo;s wrath. However, we also need to pass through baptism and be saved by baptism from our crooked and perverted generation. Just as the flood enabled the members of Noah&rsquo;s household in the ark to be separated from the old world and to enter into a new world, so also baptism enables us who are in Christ by faith to be separated from the old creation and to enter into a new realm. In order to be saved from the corrupted world, we must be baptized. This aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation cannot be received by believing; we need to believe and be baptized in order to obtain it.</p>
<p>Faith, calling, confessing, and baptism are four interconnected matters constituting the complete way to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. They are one complete step to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. If we have these four matters, we are fully saved.</p><h2 class="head2">Its Results</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Save His people from their sins&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 1:21).</p>
<p>The first result of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is deliverance from sin. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation saves us from our sins. Whoever receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is delivered from the punishment and authority of sin.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Redeemed us out of the curse of the law&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 3:13).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation satisfied the requirements of the law and redeemed us out of the curse of the law. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivers us from the curse of the law. Whoever receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is no longer under the curse of the law</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Delivers us from the wrath which is coming&rdquo;</strong> (1 Thes. 1:10).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation solves the problems of our sin and the punishment related to our sins. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivers us from God&rsquo;s coming wrath. Whoever receives the Lord&rsquo;s salvation does not need to fear God&rsquo;s coming wrath because the Lord on the cross received the punishment of God&rsquo;s wrath in our place and drank the cup of God&rsquo;s wrath for us.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Delivered us out of the authority of darkness&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 1:13).</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation delivers us out of the authority of darkness. The authority of darkness is Satan and his kingdom. Through His death on the cross, the Lord defeated Satan and his kingdom. Satan and his kingdom have no ground in us. We have been delivered from Satan&rsquo;s kingdom and his domination.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Rescue us out of the present evil age&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 1:4).</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, the world was judged through His death on the cross. Furthermore, when we were baptized into the Lord&rsquo;s death, being buried together with Him, we were also saved from the world. Therefore, the Lord&rsquo;s salvation rescues us out of the present evil age.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:24).</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, we escape judgment and death because He bore our sins on the cross, He was judged by God, and He fully tasted death on our behalf. We are saved, and we will not be judged and condemned again. We have already passed out of death into life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Proof</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;To give knowledge of salvation to His people by the forgiveness of their sins&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 1:77; see also 1 John 5:13; 3:14; Rom. 8:16).</p>
<p>We can know that we are eternally saved now. We know we are saved because our sins are forgiven, our conscience is at peace, the burden of our sin has fallen away, and our spirit is released. The Word of God, the Bible, also tells us that we have the Lord&rsquo;s life and that we are saved when we believe. The change in our life and living also proves that we are saved. The Holy Spirit is in our spirit, and He testifies that we are the children of God. These things give us the assurance to know that we are saved. (We will study the details of this point in chapter 15.)</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Testimony</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Baptism</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Baptism, not a putting away of the filth of the flesh but the appeal of a good conscience unto God&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 3:21).</p>
<p>A person who is saved by faith should not only be assured inwardly of his salvation but also testify outwardly of his salvation. As soon as one is saved, his first testimony should be baptism. Baptism is the way to obtain the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation; it is also a testimony that one has obtained the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. When one is baptized, he receives the Lord&rsquo;s full salvation and testifies that he has obtained the Lord&rsquo;s salvation. He testifies that his sins were washed away by the Lord, that he is joined to the Lord, and that he has died together with the Lord. Baptism is a silent testimony that comes out of a clear conscience. Although this is before God, it is also before others. Under normal conditions, when we see someone being baptized, we know he is saved.</p><h2 class="head3">The Joy of Salvation</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Restore to me the gladness of Your salvation&rdquo;; &ldquo;You surround me with the ringing shouts of deliverance&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 51:12; 32:7; see also Luke 15:24, 32; Acts 8:39; 16:34).</p>
<p>The second testimony of a person who has been saved is joy. Salvation causes sinners to be forgiven, to be released from the burden of sin, to be reconciled to God, to be released, to obtain the life of God, and even to obtain God Himself. Moreover, it causes people to obtain a heavenly inheritance and an eternal hope. Salvation makes people rejoice. How could a person who has received so many great, high, extraordinary, and wonderful blessings not rejoice? When the prodigal son returned home and tasted the great love of his father, he could not refrain from rejoicing together with his father. When the Ethiopian eunuch received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, he went on his way rejoicing. When the Philippian jailer and his entire household received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, they all exulted. Joy in those who are saved is a testimony of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">A Change in Living</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Zaccheus...said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much. And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 19:8-9; see also Matt. 3:8).</p>
<p>The third testimony of a saved person is a change in his living. When someone encounters the Lord and is saved, he gains the Lord&rsquo;s life through the Spirit&rsquo;s entering into and abiding in him. The Lord&rsquo;s life, which passed through death and resurrection, has great power. When the Lord&rsquo;s life enters into a person, it changes him and is manifested in his outward living. No one who experiences this can remain the same. Zaccheus was a great sinner who was greedy and stingy. But as soon as he encountered the Lord, he changed and gave half of what he had to the poor and restored fourfold what he had taken from others by false accusation. This came from the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, and it testified that the Lord&rsquo;s salvation had come to him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Its Security</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Eternal salvation&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 5:9).</p>
<p>We are saved once for all. Our salvation is not based upon our works or ourselves; instead, it is based upon the Lord and His work. We ourselves and our works can change and are not reliable, but the Lord and His work will not change and are eternally reliable. We cannot obtain the Lord&rsquo;s salvation by our works, and we cannot lose the Lord&rsquo;s salvation by our works. The Lord did not save us because of things that we have done, and He will not take away His salvation because of things that we will do. Since our salvation is apart from works, our works have absolutely no effect on our salvation. The Lord&rsquo;s gift of salvation issues from the grace of His unchanging love and is based upon His eternal work of redemption which He accomplished on the cross. Therefore, it cannot be changed with respect to us because of our works. The Lord, His love, His grace, and His work are all eternal and unchanging. Therefore, the salvation He gives is also eternal and unchanging. Because His grace and His work have saved us, our salvation is once for all.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;By no means perish forever&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28-29).</p>
<p>The greatest blessing we obtain when we are saved is the life of God. This life is the same as God Himself and will by no means perish forever. His life makes us those who will never perish. God gives us His life once for all; He will never repent and take His life from us. Once we obtain His life, we cannot lose it. We have received the eternal life, and we will never perish.</p>
<p>We not only have eternal life, which prevents us from perishing forever, but we also have the powerful hands of the Lord and the Father keeping us; no one can snatch us out of these powerful hands. Our salvation is as secure as God is. (We will examine the details concerning this matter in chapter 16.)</p><h2 class="head1">DAILY SALVATION</h2>
<p>The second kind of salvation spoken of in the Bible is daily salvation. This is our living of salvation, which is lived out by our daily relying on the Lord after our salvation.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Work out your own salvation&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 2:12).</p>
<p>The Chinese translation, which says, &ldquo;Carry out the work of your salvation,&rdquo; does not convey the meaning of this verse. There is no such sentence in the original language of the entire New Testament, and there is no such thought in the Bible. Our salvation is not something we can work to carry out; rather, we obtain it freely through God&rsquo;s grace. If our salvation was something we could work to carry out, it would be out of our own works. God&rsquo;s Word clearly states that we are saved not by our works but by God&rsquo;s grace. The meaning of <em>work out your own salvation</em> is that we should live out the salvation we have already received. We have received salvation; now we need to live it out.</p>
<p>We receive God&rsquo;s salvation as soon as we believe, so the question of our eternal salvation is resolved; however, after being eternally saved we still must live out God&rsquo;s salvation. The main elements in God&rsquo;s salvation are the divine life and God Himself. Therefore, living out God&rsquo;s salvation mainly means to live out the life of God Himself. This is not something we can do as soon as we believe; it requires obedience with fear and trembling. Our receiving of salvation is by faith, and we receive it once and for all. Our living out of salvation is by obedience, and we must be in fear and trembling daily, even moment by moment, to work this out.</p>
<p>As soon as we are saved, God enters into us to be our salvation. After we are saved, our willing and our working are according to the operation of God within us for the accomplishment of His good pleasure. Therefore, we must be in fear and trembling every day to obey God&rsquo;s operation within us to make us blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation among whom we shine as luminaries, manifesting God&rsquo;s life (vv. 13-16). This is how we can live out God, who lives in us as our salvation, and this is also how we live out the salvation we have received.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 7:25).</p>
<p>The salvation spoken of in this verse is not the salvation that Christ accomplished on the cross as our Savior; it is the salvation of Christ as our Priest in the heavens (cf. v. 24). This is not the Lord&rsquo;s salvation for redemption of sins but Christ&rsquo;s salvation through intercession. After we are saved by faith, the Lord gives us daily salvation. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation as our Priest is based on His salvation as our Redeemer. His salvation of intercession is based on His salvation of redemption. His daily salvation is based on His eternal salvation. There is a distinction between these two kinds of salvation. The Lord as our Savior redeemed us from our sins and gave us eternal salvation. The Lord as our interceding Priest gives us a daily, instant salvation that saves us every day and solves our daily problems. In the former case, we received eternal life, and in the latter, we are enabled to live a heavenly life. The Lord&rsquo;s eternal salvation saves us eternally, and the Lord&rsquo;s daily salvation saves us to the uttermost. The word <em>uttermost</em> refers not only to time but also to extent. The Lord&rsquo;s daily salvation with respect to time saves us to the end and with respect to extent saves us to the uttermost. This daily salvation comes from the Lord, who is always living in the heavens as our great High Priest to intercede for us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Deliver us from the evil one&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 6:13).</p>
<p>Being delivered from the evil one is to be delivered from Satan. The Lord said that we should pray this prayer every day. Thus, this is part of the daily salvation we receive. Satan tempts us daily, even hourly. He attacks and attempts to ensnare us; therefore, we need the Lord to deliver us from the evil one every hour of every day.</p><h2 class="head1">ENVIRONMENTAL SALVATION</h2>
<p>The third kind of salvation spoken of in the Bible is environmental salvation. This is the salvation God gives us today in our troubling environment.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 1:10, see also vv. 8-9).</p>
<p>Paul spoke this word after many afflictions had befallen him and his co-workers when they were in Asia. They were excessively burdened beyond their power and despaired even of living. They had the response of death in themselves, but God delivered them out of so great a death. This salvation does not refer to God&rsquo;s eternal salvation; rather, it refers to environmental salvation. Paul experienced this kind of salvation in many desperate situations, so he believed that God would deliver them out of their present hardship, and he expressed hope that He would deliver them from sufferings in the future. Every saved one should believe in, hope for, and experience this kind of salvation in difficult situations. God enjoys giving us this kind of salvation.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 1:19, see also vv. 12-13).</p>
<p>Paul wrote these words when he was in prison. Nevertheless, he knew and believed that through the petition of the Philippian believers and the bountiful supply of the Spirit his imprisonment would turn out to his salvation. This passage does not refer to being eternally saved from sins, from hell, or from being under the law; instead, it speaks of being saved from our sufferings, that is, environmental salvation.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;I was delivered out of the lion&rsquo;s mouth. The Lord will deliver me from every evil work&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:17-18, see also vv. 14-16).</p>
<p>Although Paul encountered persecution from men and was imprisoned for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, the Lord delivered him out of &ldquo;the lion&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo; He also believed that the Lord would deliver him from every evil work. These passages clearly refer to Paul&rsquo;s receiving of God&rsquo;s environmental salvation in his sufferings.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The angel of Jehovah encamps / Around those who fear Him, and He delivers them&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 34:7).</p>
<p>The angel of Jehovah is His messenger who encamps around those who fear God and delivers them. This certainly refers to environmental deliverance. Frequently, when we encounter hardships, God sends His angels to deliver us. Sometimes God tells not only one angel to save us but sends many angels to encamp around us and deliver us. This kind of deliverance is something that we who fear Him can obtain at any time and in any place when we encounter hardships; therefore, it is environmental salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SALVATION OF OUR BODY</h2>
<p>The fourth kind of salvation spoken of in the Bible is the salvation of the body. This will occur when the Lord returns. It is the redemption of our old creation body into the glory of the new creation.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We were saved in hope&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:24).</p>
<p>According to the context of this verse, <em>saved</em> does not refer to our spirit but to the redemption of our body. We are eternally saved when we believe and obtain eternal life in our spirit. We do not need to hope for something that we have already obtained. However, the redemption of our body requires us to hope because we must wait for the day of the Lord&rsquo;s return. When we believed, we obtained eternal salvation and our spirit was enlivened. However, our body is still groaning and travailing in pain in the old creation, which is under the slavery of corruption with the suffering of illness and aging. When the Lord returns, He will transfigure our body, which is under the slavery of the old creation, and bring it into the glorious freedom of the new creation. The salvation of our body will occur in the future.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Now is our salvation nearer than when we believed&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 13:11).</p>
<p>The salvation spoken of here must refer to the salvation of our body. It cannot refer to eternal salvation because we obtained this salvation when our spirit was enlivened the moment we believed. The salvation of our body will occur in the future; thus, it is nearer than when we believed. The Lord&rsquo;s return is nearer to us today than at the moment of our eternal salvation. Therefore, the salvation of our body, the redemption of our body, is nearer than when we believed.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SALVATION OF OUR SOUL</h2>
<p>The Bible also speaks of the salvation of our soul. People usually divide man into two parts, the soul and the body, but in the Bible, God tells us that man has three parts, spirit and soul and body (1 Thes. 5:23). Because we have these three parts, we have three kinds of salvation. Our spirit was enlivened when we believed. We obtained eternal salvation through our regeneration by the Holy Spirit. At that time, God forgave our sins and enlivened our deadened spirit. The salvation of our body will occur when the Lord returns. At that time, the Lord will transfigure our body, using His great power to transfigure the body of our humiliation into a glorious body. The salvation of our soul will be obtained when we enter into the millennial kingdom to reign with the Lord. It will be the Lord&rsquo;s reward to us when our soul enjoys the joy of the kingdom with Him.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Whoever wants to save his soul-life shall lose it; but whoever loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 16:25, see also vv. 24-27; 10:37-39).</p>
<p>According to the principle of the Bible, the salvation spoken of here does not refer to eternal salvation because eternal salvation is obtained freely through faith without any requirement that we pay a price. Salvation in these verses comes from losing our soul-life; it is obtained by our willingness to pay the price of sacrificing our soul. Moreover, eternal salvation is related to the enlivening of our spirit, whereas the salvation spoken of here is related to finding the soul-life. From the context of this passage, <em>save</em> refers to receiving a reward when the Lord returns in glory because we were willing to deny ourselves, take up our cross, follow the Lord, and lose our soul-life for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. According to the New Testament, this reward is our entrance into the millennial kingdom and our enjoyment of the joy of our Lord (25:21). The enjoyment of joy is particularly related to the soul. If we are not willing to lose our enjoyment in this age, we will save our soul-life today but lose our soul-life in the future, that is, we will lose our soul&rsquo;s enjoyment in the millennial kingdom. If we are willing to sacrifice our soul&rsquo;s enjoyment for the Lord&rsquo;s sake in this age, even to the extent of losing our soul-life, we will find our soul-life in the future; that is, we will obtain a reward when the Lord returns, and our soul will enjoy the joy of the millennial kingdom with the Lord. This is the salvation of the soul. The Lord also speaks of this matter in Matthew 10:39.</p>
<p>Our soul is not only where we experience joy and happiness but also where we experience suffering. Whether we experience joy or suffering, these are particularly felt in the soul. The suffering sensed by the soul actually gives one a feeling of suffering. All the ridicule, persecution, and harm that we receive from others because we believe, serve, and follow the Lord cause our soul to suffer. For example, some want to love the Lord, but their spouse does not agree and gives them trouble. Others want to serve God and take the Lord&rsquo;s way, but their parents or children oppose them, their friends reject them, and even their closest relatives and neighbors persecute them. These are sufferings to the soul. If we do not love and follow the Lord because we want to avoid these sufferings, we will save our soul-life and avoid them. However, this will cause us to lose the enjoyment of the kingdom in our soul. If we are willing to bear these sufferings for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we will allow our soul to be troubled, to be dealt with, to be put to death, to be lost, and to be sacrificed for the Lord. This will be the salvation of our soul, and it will enable our soul to enjoy the joy of the Lord in the future.</p>
<p>Our soul is just our self. If we are willing to deny our self, to put the self to death without saving it, we will lose, rather than save, our soul-life. If we are willing to do this today, we will experience the Lord&rsquo;s life in our spirit and enjoy the joy of the Lord in our soul in the future. In the future, when we enjoy the joy of the Lord in our soul, we will find our soul-life and obtain the salvation of our soul. This future salvation requires us to lose our soul-life today by allowing our soul to suffer, to be troubled, and even to be put to death.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Whoever will lose his soul-life for My sake and the gospel&rsquo;s shall save it&rdquo;</strong> (Mark 8:35).</p>
<p>While this passage says the same thing as Matthew 16:25, which speaks of losing our soul-life for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, it also speaks of losing our soul-life for the gospel&rsquo;s sake. Being for the Lord&rsquo;s sake and the gospel&rsquo;s sake are inseparable matters. If we sacrifice the enjoyment of our soul and our soul-life itself in this age, we will obtain a special enjoyment of our soul in the future kingdom as we reign with the Lord in glory and enjoy the joy of the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Whoever seeks to preserve his soul-life will lose it, and whoever loses it will preserve it alive&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 17:33).</p>
<p>Any believer who seeks to preserve his soul-life and its enjoyment for himself in this age will lose the enjoyment of his soul in the age of the kingdom; whoever loses his soul&rsquo;s enjoyment for the Lord will save his soul in the kingdom age and will obtain enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;He who has endured to the end, this one shall be saved&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 10:22; 24:13).</p>
<p>The salvation spoken of here by the Lord requires enduring to the end. This is different from eternal salvation which requires only faith. According to the context, the Lord is speaking of the salvation of the soul. Some believers are persecuted and killed for the Lord. If they endure to the end, the Lord will reward them in the future by causing their soul to avoid suffering and by giving them the enjoyment of His joy.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;In your endurance you will possess your souls&rdquo;</strong> (Luke 21:19).</p>
<p>This verse clearly speaks of enduring suffering for the Lord, which causes our souls to be saved. This word is further proof of the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 10:22 concerning the salvation of our soul. Both verses speak of the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Them who have faith to the gaining of the soul&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:39).</p>
<p>Although this verse speaks of faith causing our souls to be gained, it is not referring to the faith we had when we first believed in the Lord. Rather, it refers to our faith after believing in the Lord. This is not the faith needed for our entrance into salvation but the faith needed for our walk on the Lord&rsquo;s way. It is not faith for obtaining life but faith for living. If we walk by faith on the Lord&rsquo;s way after we are saved and live an overcoming life, this faith will cause our souls to be saved in the future, when we participate in the glory and joy of the kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;Therefore putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice, receive in meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:21).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of our souls being saved by putting away all filthiness and the abundance of malice and receiving in meekness the implanted word. This is different from eternal salvation, which requires only faith. Eternal salvation is obtained as soon as we believe and receive the Lord&rsquo;s word. The salvation of our soul will be received in the future if we put away filthiness and malice and continually receive and keep the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:9, see also v. 5).</p>
<p><em>Faith</em> here refers to our faith for living after we are saved (cf. v. 7). This faith enables us to receive God&rsquo;s preserving and to overcome tribulations and trials so that our souls can be saved. With such faith, we will receive the salvation that God has prepared, which will be manifested at the Lord&rsquo;s return and which consists of our escaping all sufferings and enjoying the joy of glory.</p>
<p><strong>9. &ldquo;The Lord...will save me into His heavenly kingdom&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 4:18; see also 2 Pet. 1:11).</p>
<p>After Paul was saved, he sacrificed all the enjoyment of his soul in this age for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, and he was prepared to lose his soul-life, to be willingly martyred for the Lord. Therefore, he believed that the Lord would save him into His heavenly kingdom and cause his soul to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s joy there. In the future, the Lord will certainly give him much glory and a rich entrance into His kingdom so that he will enjoy glory and joy with the Lord.</p>
<p>Eternal salvation is freely given at the time of our believing through the enlivening of our spirit, and the salvation of our body will be received when the Lord returns, but the salvation of the soul will be obtained only in the millennial kingdom by those who are willing to suffer for the Lord and to lose the enjoyment of their soul today. The salvation that is related to the spirit and the body does not require us to do anything; only the salvation of the soul requires that we pay a price, the price of losing the enjoyment of our soul in this age. The salvation of our soul is the portion of God&rsquo;s salvation that is a reward. (We will cover the details of this portion in chapters 47 and 48.)</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>The assurance of salvation means that we can be assured of our salvation. Assurance is not merely a matter of knowing but also a matter of being certain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SAVED BY FAITH</h2>
<p>Many think that faith is a matter for the present and that salvation is a matter for the future; they think that even though a person believes now, he will be saved only in the future. But the Bible very clearly, accurately, and assuredly tells us that once a person believes, he is saved. When a person believes, it is not that he is about to be saved; rather, he is saved. When a person believes, he is saved in the present; he does not have to wait for the future. There is no separating distance between faith and salvation.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Your sins have been forgiven you because of His name&rdquo;; &ldquo;In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 2:12; Col. 1:14).</p>
<p>In these two Bible verses we must emphasize the word <em>have.</em> Our sins <em>have been</em> forgiven because of His name. These verses do not say that our sins <em>will be</em> forgiven but that they <em>have been</em> forgiven because of His name, not because of our works or anything of ourselves. If forgiveness was dependent on our works or anything of ourselves, we would need to wait until we worked it out before the matter could be decided. But this is not the case. Instead, forgiveness is because of His name. Once we believe in and confess the Lord&rsquo;s name, we participate in His name and become related to His name; therefore, because of His name our sins <em>have</em> been forgiven. When we confess the Lord&rsquo;s name and possess His name, our sins are forgiven at that time because of His name. Thus, God <em>has</em> forgiven all our sins. We do not need to wait for them to be forgiven in the future. At the time we believed, He forgave us. Moreover, He <em>has</em> forgiven all our sins and all our evil, not just a certain portion of our sins. Thus, once we believe, all our sins <em>are</em> forgiven and we <em>are</em> saved.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified&rdquo;</strong> (1 Cor. 6:11).</p>
<p>We must emphasize <em>but</em> and <em>were</em> in this Bible verse. Being washed, sanctified, and justified are some things that have been accomplished. The moment we believed in the Lord, accepted Him as our Savior, and participated in His accomplished redemption for us on the cross, God washed us, sanctified us, and justified us. We <em>were</em> washed, we <em>were</em> sanctified, and we <em>were</em> justified.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Having been reconciled&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 5:10).</p>
<p>Once we believed in the Son of God and received what His death accomplished for us, we were reconciled to God. Once we believe and partake of the death of God&rsquo;s Son, we are reconciled to God. We do not have to wait to be reconciled in the future.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Christ has set us free&rdquo;</strong> (Gal. 5:1).</p>
<p>Once we believe in Christ and are joined to Him by faith, He sets us free, releasing us from the curse and bondage of the law. He <em>has</em> set us free. This is an accomplished fact; we do not need to wait for the future.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;God...has regenerated us&rdquo;; &ldquo;Having been regenerated&rdquo;</strong> (1 Pet. 1:3, 23).</p>
<p>We must emphasize the words <em>has</em> and <em>having</em> when we read these two verses. God has regenerated us; we do not need to wait until the future for regeneration. When we believe and receive the Lord who died and resurrected, God regenerates us by putting His life into our spirit by His Spirit. Therefore, we were regenerated when we believed. Because we are regenerated, we do not need to wait to be regenerated in the future.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life&rdquo;</strong> (John 5:24).</p>
<p>In this verse the words <em>has,does not,</em> and <em>has passed</em> are so precious. We really should pay attention to them. As soon as we believe, we have eternal life; we do not come into judgment or condemnation, and we pass out of death into life. When we hear the Lord&rsquo;s word, the gospel, and believe it, we have eternal life and do not have to wait until the future to obtain it. The word <em>will</em> does not come between believing and obtaining eternal life; instead, there is the word <em>has.</em> With <em>will</em> there is a gap; but <em>has</em> means immediately. He who believes has. There is no need to wait for the future. At the time of believing, one has eternal life, does not come into judgment, and passes out of death into life. We were in Adam, and we were condemned and under judgment because of sin. Now that we have believed into Christ, we cannot come into judgment because of righteousness. We are justified by God and become the righteousness of God in Christ because He bore our sins on the cross, became sin for us, and received the judgment that we should have received in Adam. Thus, we escape the condemnation and judgment in Adam and do not come into judgment or condemnation. Furthermore, in Adam we not only had the problems of sin and condemnation, but we also were in death. On the cross Christ not only bore our sins and received the condemnation for us but He also tasted death to the fullest and nullified death for us (Heb. 2:9; 2 Tim. 1:10), releasing His life and dispensing it into us. Therefore, by believing into Him, we not only escaped from condemnation but we also escaped from death. We are not under condemnation, and we have passed out of death into life. Since the Lord tasted death to the fullest and destroyed death for us, we have passed out of death into life by believing into Him and being joined to Him. Therefore, once we believe, having eternal life, not coming into judgment, and passing out of death into life are not matters in the future. Instead, once we believe, we have eternal life, we do not come into judgment, and we pass out of death into life. These are not things we will have in the future; they are things we obtain in the present.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;In Him also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:13).</p>
<p>When we believed in the Lord, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit. Those who are sealed with the Holy Spirit surely have received grace and are saved. Therefore, once we believe in the Lord, we are sealed with the Holy Spirit, we receive grace, and we are saved.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;Who has saved us&rdquo;; &ldquo;He saved us&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9; Titus 3:5).</p>
<p>The past tense in these passages is very important and very precious. Thank God that there are many words in the past tense in His holy Word. <em>Forgave, washed, released, received,</em> and <em>saved</em> are all in the past tense. I am afraid that when people read the Bible they fail to notice that these words are in the past tense. The phrases <em>He saves us</em> and <em>He saved us</em> are as different as the heavens and the earth. Thank God the Bible does not say, &ldquo;He saves us&rdquo; or &ldquo;He will save us&rdquo;; instead, it says, &ldquo;He saved us.&rdquo; When we believed, He saved us. When we believed, God saved us! Therefore, the moment we believed, we were saved. Hallelujah!</p><h2 class="head1">BEING ABLE TO KNOW ONE IS SAVED NOW</h2>
<p>Many think that salvation is something in the future, so they think that there is no way for them to know whether they are saved now. But in His Word, the Bible, God clearly tells us that salvation is a matter for the present; moreover, He assuredly tells us that we can know that we are saved. Once we believe, we are saved, and at the same time, we can know that we are saved.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;You may know that you have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:13).</p>
<p>Although many received the Lord as their Savior, they do not know that they have eternal life. Many also think that although they believed in the Lord, whether or not they have eternal life is a matter that will be decided by the Lord in the future when He returns. They do not think that we can know for ourselves now. Some even go so far as to suggest that it is impossible for us to know whether we have eternal life in the present. They say that we can and should have faith in the present, but to know whether we have eternal life is something that is impossible. They think that there is no way to know whether we have eternal life in this age. But God clearly and assuredly wants us to know that we have eternal life. Thus, according to God&rsquo;s Word and ordination, we can and should know that we have eternal life.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:14).</p>
<p>God, through the apostle John, not only tells us that we have passed out of death into life the moment we believe (John 5:24), but He also assuredly tells us that we can know that we have passed out of death into life. After we believe, we can know that we have eternal life and have passed out of death into life. Since we know we have eternal life, we also spontaneously know that we have passed out of death into life.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;We know that we are of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:19).</p>
<p>Those who are saved are regenerated by God and are of God. This is something those who are born of God and who have His life can know and should know. How can anyone teach that a person cannot know the parents who gave birth to him? How can anyone teach that one should not know the father to whom he belongs? Since we were born of God by faith and obtained God&rsquo;s life, we can know that we are the children of God with His eternal life, and we should know that we belong to God and are saved by grace.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;For we know that...we have a building from God...eternal, in the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:1).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of knowing that we will obtain an eternal building in the heavens built by God. This eternal building in the heavens refers to the redeemed body, which will be eternal. Our present body is merely an earthly tabernacle; it is temporary. Although we are saved and have the Lord&rsquo;s life, we are still sighing and laboring in this tabernacle. When the Lord returns, our body will be redeemed, and we will be clothed with a glorious body, which will be our eternal building in the heavens. This will cause our mortal body to be swallowed up in life. For this purpose, God did a work of life in our spirit and is using His life to cultivate us so that He can use this life in us to swallow up our outward body and completely redeem us by His life from our inward spirit to our outward body in the future. Thus, we will enter into the freedom of His glory. For this, God is not only doing an inward work of cultivating us in His life, but He also gave us His Spirit as an inward pledge and guarantee, to be the collateral and the warranty that He will accomplish this matter for us. We will obtain a glorious, redeemed body, an eternal building in the heavens (vv. 2-3). Since we are saved and have God&rsquo;s life, we can know this fact now, by His life working in us and by the Holy Spirit whom He gave us. We can know that we will be clothed in a glorious body and will enjoy the heavenly, glorious freedom (Rom. 8:21-23).</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:2).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that our inward spirit has the Lord&rsquo;s life, our outward body is still not like the Lord. When He is manifested, He will transfigure the body of our humiliation into a glorious body like His own (Phil. 3:20-21). We can know this by the life He gave us and by the word He spoke to us. Since He regenerated us in our spirit, causing us to have His life and nature so that we are like Him in life and nature, how could He allow our body to remain eternally in the humiliation of the old creation and not transfigure it so that we will be like Him outwardly? According to the spontaneous spiritual principles of life, we can know that we will be like Him, especially since He used clear and definite words to tell us that He will accomplish this matter. This is something we can know now.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:16).</p>
<p>We are children of God. We have the life of God, and we can know this fact now because we have proof. Our proof is the Holy Spirit witnessing with our spirit. This is also an inward proof that cannot be erased, so we should not doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>7. &ldquo;We should be called children of God; and we are...Now we are children of God&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:1-2).</p>
<p>Because we know that we have obtained God&rsquo;s life and have been born of God, we also know that we are children of God. We can say with assurance that we really are children of God. The tone of the apostle John&rsquo;s word here is so bold; it leaves no room for doubt. The spirit within every child of God who has the divine life says Amen to this point.</p>
<p><strong>8. &ldquo;For our commonwealth exists in the heavens&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:20).</p>
<p>A citizen of the heavens is one who is saved. We <em>are</em> heavenly citizens; we <em>are</em> saved. This is a fact we can know now. If this were not the case, how could Paul be so certain in his wording? Some might say that Paul might have known that he was part of a heavenly commonwealth, but that we cannot know. However, Paul does not say, &ldquo;<em>My</em> commonwealth exists in the heavens.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;<em>Our</em> commonwealth exists in the heavens.&rdquo; <em>Our</em> includes all believers who have received grace. All who have believed and who have received grace are saved; they have a commonwealth in the heavens. Therefore, everyone should and can know that they are saved. They can confidently confess their citizenship in the heavens.</p><h2 class="head1">KNOWING THAT WE ARE SAVED</h2>
<p>How can we know that we are saved? We cannot know without a foundation. We need proof. The Bible speaks of at least three proofs to let us know that we are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Inward Proof</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;This is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:11).</p>
<p>The first proof that lets us know that we are saved is within us; it can be called the inward proof. This is the Holy Spirit within us as the testimony; it is God through the Holy Spirit testifying of the Son. This testimony is of the eternal life, which God has given to us in His Son. Everyone who believes in God&rsquo;s Son has this testimony within him. Everyone who believes God has a feeling in his deepest part that he is born of God and that he belongs to God. Although some are not clear in their minds or have doubts in their hearts, there is definitely an inexplicable feeling in the deepest part of their being that makes them feel that they have entered into a relationship with God and that they have been begotten by Him. This is what the Holy Spirit testifies within; it is a testimony of life within them and it proves that they also have life because they have the Son of God. Thus, by the testimony of the Holy Spirit within and by the feeling we have from the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s testimony, we can know that we have the life of God and are saved.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:15-16).</p>
<p>The witnessing Spirit within us is in our spirit, witnessing with our spirit, causing our spirit to feel what the Spirit witnesses and to witness with the Spirit that we are children of God. Each believer is very happy to call, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; It is very natural for us to call, &ldquo;Abba, Father.&rdquo; Whenever we address God in this way, we inwardly feel very sweet and comfortable. This is because we are children born of God with His life and because the Spirit of His Son has entered into us. It is very natural and sweet for us to address our human fathers as &ldquo;father.&rdquo; In the same way we can call God, &ldquo;Abba, Father&rdquo; and feel so sweet and comfortable. This proves that we have the life of God and are children begotten by Him. By the Holy Spirit witnessing with our spirit, we can know that we are saved and are children of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Outward Proof</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I have written these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 5:13).</p>
<p>This verse speaks of these things being written that we may know that we have eternal life. <em>These things</em> refer to all the things written prior to this verse, which were written by God through the Holy Spirit. The things written by God through the Holy Spirit cause us to know that we have eternal life. Therefore, they are the second proof which lets us know we are saved. The second proof is the Word written by God through the Holy Spirit, that is, the Bible. The Bible is outside of us, so it can be called the outward proof. The inward proof of our salvation is the Holy Spirit, and the outward proof is the Bible. God not only uses the Holy Spirit within us to prove that we are His children, but He also uses the Bible without to confirm that we have His life. Just as God uses the Bible to testify concerning the redemption He accomplished for us through His Son, He also uses the Bible to confirm that He accomplished our salvation and worked this salvation into us in His Son and through the Holy Spirit. Acts 10:43 says, &ldquo;Everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins.&rdquo; Verse 39 of chapter 13 says, &ldquo;In this One everyone who believes is justified.&rdquo; John 3:18 says, &ldquo;He who believes into Him is not condemned.&rdquo; Other verses speak of believing into Him and having eternal life (vv. 16, 36; 6:40). John 5:24 speaks of those who believe into Him having eternal life and passing out of death into life. John 1:12 says, &ldquo;As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name.&rdquo; First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life.&rdquo; Acts 16:31 says, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you shall be saved.&rdquo; Romans 10:10 says, &ldquo;With the heart there is believing unto righteousness, and with the mouth there is confession unto salvation.&rdquo; Verse 13 of the same chapter says, &ldquo;Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo; These passages in the Bible are not only revelations or promises that God has given to us; rather, they are a written covenant. They are proofs that He has written for us. Based upon the words of His written covenant, these written proofs, we can know with assurance that as soon as we believe in the Lord, our sins are forgiven, we are justified, we are no longer condemned, we have eternal life, we are children of God, and we are saved.</p>
<p>A person receives an inheritance through a will and testament. The Lord made these words of His written covenant a testament for us so that we could inherit the blessings of His salvation (Heb. 9:15-17). The person bequeathing an inheritance puts all of his inheritance into a will and testament and passes it on to his heirs. The Lord put His salvation into His written testament, the Bible, and gave it to us. One inherits property according to clearly written provisions of a will and testament, not according to feelings or imaginations. In the same way, we inherit the Lord&rsquo;s grace according to the Bible, the written testament given to us by the Lord; we inherit according to the clearly written provisions of the Bible, not according to our feelings or imaginations. With the inward proof of the Holy Spirit, there are feelings. But with the outward proof of the Bible, there is no need for feelings. With respect to the Holy Spirit as the inward proof, we have feelings and we will have feelings. But with respect to the Bible as the outward proof, we do not need feelings, and we should not worry about whether we have any feelings. We should simply stand on the clearly written provisions of the Bible to determine whether we are saved. By this we can know we are saved.</p><h2 class="head2">The Proof of Love</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brothers&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:14).</p>
<p>God is love, and since we have received His life, we surely have His heart of love. Moreover, because we were begotten of Him, we love all those born of Him (5:1). When a saved one sees a brother in the Lord, he feels an indescribable joy and an inexplicable love. Therefore, love for our brothers in the Lord is also a proof that we are saved. This can be called the proof of love. Faith in the Lord gives us life and causes us to pass out of death into life, but our love for the brothers lets us know that we have life and that we have passed out of death into life.</p>
<p>By the feeling in our spirit, by the clear word of the Bible, and by the fact of our loving heart, we can know that we are saved. Even if we do not remember the exact day of our salvation, the fact of our salvation can be known by these three proofs. There may be some who have believed in the Lord but do not know that they are saved. By these proofs, however, they can know. By the living feeling in our spirit, by the Lord&rsquo;s clear word in the Scriptures, and by the fact of our love in our living, we can know assuredly with definite proof that we are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING WE ARE SAVED CAUSING US<br />
TO LOVE THE LORD AND TO ESCAPE FROM SIN</h2>
<p>Many have believed in the Lord but do not love Him. Many pursue Him but do not seek to live an overcoming life. There are many reasons for this, but for some the main reason is that they do not know that they are saved. If they knew assuredly that they had received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, obtained His life, and belonged to the Lord, they would zealously love the Lord, pursue Him, and earnestly desire to live a holy life.</p>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Therefore also we are determined...to gain the honor of being well pleasing to Him&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:9).</p>
<p>The apostle said that we are determined to be well pleasing to the Lord because we know that we will obtain a building from God, eternal, in the heavens, that is, because we know that we are saved and will see the Lord in the heavens and enjoy His presence. Since we know this, we spontaneously make a determination to please Him.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;The love of Christ constrains us because we have judged this, that One died for all, therefore all died; and He died for all that those who live may no longer live to themselves but to Him who died for them and has been raised&rdquo;</strong> (2 Cor. 5:14-15).</p>
<p>Knowing that we have received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation makes us thankful for the Lord&rsquo;s love, and this love constrains us to love the Lord and to live to Him.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;For our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Phil. 3:20).</p>
<p>If we know that we are saved, heavenly citizens, we will wait for the Lord&rsquo;s coming and for our being received into the heavens. Our living of awaiting the Lord comes from knowing that we are saved ones whose commonwealth is in the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;We know that if He is manifested, we will be like Him because we will see Him even as He is. And everyone who has this hope set on Him purifies himself, even as He is pure&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 3:2-3).</p>
<p>Since we know that we are saved, we know that we will be like Him when He returns because we will see Him as He is. This causes us to purify ourselves as we set our hope on Him and wait for Him. Therefore, knowing we will see the Lord and be like Him causes us to live a life that is purified from sin, a holy life that is like the Lord&rsquo;s.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SECURITY OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>In Christianity today, people have many different views on salvation. Some think that it is impossible to know that we are saved; others think that we can still perish after we are saved. The Bible, however, shows that our salvation is not only certain but also secure. Once we are saved, our salvation can never be shaken or changed. Therefore, once we are saved, we are eternally saved. This point is proven in the Bible in relation to at least twelve items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Predestinating us unto sonship...according to... His will&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:5).</p>
<p>God made us His sons and predestinated us unto sonship according to His will, not according to our condition. If our sonship was based on our condition, it would not be secure, because our condition constantly fluctuates. But our sonship was predetermined according to His will; it does not depend on our condition. His will is not based on spur-of-the-moment decisions; rather, it is according to His eternal plan. It is eternal and unchanging; it does not depend on and cannot be influenced by our condition. Thus, our sonship is eternally secure.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works but according to His own purpose&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9).</p>
<p>God saves us and calls us according to His purpose, not according to our works. The salvation and calling of God are according to His will and apart from our works; they have absolutely nothing to do with our behavior. Thus, our salvation will not change even if our behavior changes; instead, it is eternally secure according to God&rsquo;s unchanging purpose.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;This is the will of Him who sent Me, that of all which He has given Me I should lose nothing&rdquo;</strong> (John 6:39).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s will is that all whom He has chosen and given to the Lord, according to His unchanging purpose, would not be lost. Since we were saved according to His choosing and belong to the Lord, we will never be lost. We are eternally secure.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The unchangeableness of His counsel&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 6:17).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s counsel cannot be changed; therefore, the salvation which God gives according to His counsel cannot be changed. How could it? Our salvation is eternally secure according to God&rsquo;s counsel and purpose.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S CHOOSING AND CALLING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:4).</p>
<p>God did not choose us accidentally or on the spur of the moment; He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world. His choosing was not because of any special condition of ours. Our salvation is not accidental or coincidental; it is according to God&rsquo;s choosing in Christ before the foundation of the world, which cannot be influenced by any change on our part. Thus, our salvation is eternally secure and unchanging.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;You did not choose Me, but I chose you&rdquo;</strong> (John 15:16).</p>
<p>We did not choose the Lord. We would not choose the Lord or even think of Him; rather, He chose us. Even if we had chosen the Lord, our choosing would change because we are prone to vacillate. Instead, the Lord chose us. He is eternally unchanging; therefore, His choosing is also eternally unchanging.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;That the purpose of God according to selection might remain, not of works but of Him who calls&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 9:11).</p>
<p>God Himself selected us according to His purpose, not according to our works. Therefore, our works are not related to God&rsquo;s choosing and absolutely cannot affect His choosing. God&rsquo;s choosing is of Himself and according to His purpose. Both He and His purpose are eternally unchanging, so how can His choosing change? How can His choosing not be eternally secure?</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;The gracious gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 11:29).</p>
<p>Since God&rsquo;s calling is according to His unchanging person and unchanging purpose, He will not repent of it or change. Therefore, the salvation that we received according to His choosing will not change. According to God&rsquo;s choosing, our salvation is secure.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S LOVE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Not that we have loved God but that He loved us&rdquo;</strong> (1 John 4:10).</p>
<p>If our salvation was because of our love for God, it would not be reliable because our love easily changes. But our salvation is because God loved us. It comes out from His love for us. God&rsquo;s love, like His person, is unchanging. Therefore, our salvation is secure and unchanging.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Eternal love&rdquo;; &ldquo;He loved...to the uttermost&rdquo;</strong> (Jer. 31:3; John 13:1).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s love for us is an eternal love, a love that is to the uttermost. God&rsquo;s salvation, which is out of His love and because of His love, is also eternal and to the uttermost. It will not change or cease because of a change in our condition.</p>
<p><strong>3. His love, which &ldquo;will not forget,&rdquo; being stronger than a nursing mother&rsquo;s love</strong> (Isa. 49:15).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s love for us is a love that does not forget. Even a mother may forget her nursing child, but God will never forget us. His love is stronger than a mother&rsquo;s love. This love makes Him unable to change, to cancel, or to rescind the salvation that He has given us.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:35-39).</p>
<p>Since God loves us, what can separate us from His love? Nothing! Neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature can separate us from the love of God. The love of God from which we cannot be separated secures His salvation in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GRACE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;For by grace you have been saved...and this not of yourselves; it is the gift of God; not of works&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 2:8-9).</p>
<p>Our salvation is not of ourselves or our works but by God&rsquo;s grace; this grace is the gift of God and is of God. If it were of ourselves or our works, it would be changeable; however, it is of God and His grace, so it will not change. We and our works fluctuate and are undependable, but God&rsquo;s grace is stable, immovable, and eternally secure.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Who has saved us...not according to our works but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages&rdquo;</strong> (2 Tim. 1:9).</p>
<p>God has saved us according to the grace that He gave us in Christ before the times of the ages, not according to our works. This grace was given to us by God in Christ before the times of the ages; it was not given to us in the present because of our works. Therefore, it cannot be influenced or changed in the future by our works. Since God gave grace to us in Christ, it does not depend on us. Regardless of our condition, we can never change God&rsquo;s grace that has saved us.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;We have redemption...according to the riches of His grace&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 1:7).</p>
<p>Our salvation is according to the riches of God&rsquo;s grace. The riches of God&rsquo;s grace are His all-sufficient grace. Since we are saved by God&rsquo;s all-sufficient grace, this grace is fully responsible for us, it meets our every need, and it saves us to the uttermost. This grace is without any lack or deficiency that could cause our salvation to be jeopardized. Hence, it is eternally secure and established.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;The gospel...is the power of God unto salvation to everyone who believes...for the righteousness of God is revealed in it&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 1:16-17).</p>
<p>The gospel of God is His power. It can save everyone who believes because His righteousness is revealed in the gospel. His gospel speaks not only of His love and grace but also of His righteousness. We are saved not only because of His love and grace but also according to His righteousness. Love and grace are related to feelings, but righteousness is a judicial matter. Emotions can change with a change of the heart, but judicial matters are principles that are eternally unchanging. Matters of love and grace are not bound by law; they are subject to a person&rsquo;s willingness or unwillingness. However, judicial matters of righteousness are absolutely bound by law. They are not matters of choice but matters of requirement. If God came to save us merely by His love and grace, our salvation would merely be a matter of His willingness to save us. But He saves us not only because of His love and grace but also according to His righteousness. He is not only willing to save us; He is required to save us. Although His heart causes Him to love us and to give us grace, His love and grace cannot bind Him. The only thing that binds God is His righteousness. When we believe, His righteousness leaves Him no choice but to save us; it requires that He save us eternally and to the uttermost. This righteousness is of Him, not of us. It is not only powerful but also secure.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;With a view to the demonstrating of His righteousness...who justifies him who is of the faith of Jesus&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 3:26).</p>
<p>Out of His love God gave us His only begotten Son, the Lord Jesus, as our Savior (John 3:16). Because of God&rsquo;s grace, the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption for us (Heb. 2:9). When the Lord Jesus went to the cross and bore God&rsquo;s righteous judgment in our place, He satisfied the requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness. Now God justifies those who believe in the Lord Jesus, according to His righteousness and with a view to demonstrating His righteousness. If the Lord Jesus had not satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements for us, even though He wanted to give us His forgiving grace because of His love, He would not have been able to forgive and to justify us without falling into unrighteousness. However, since the Lord Jesus satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements on our behalf, God must forgive and justify us according to His righteousness. If He did not, He would fall into unrighteousness. Before the Lord Jesus resolved the problem of God&rsquo;s righteous condemnation of us, God could not have forgiven us without being unrighteous. After the Lord Jesus satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirements on our behalf, God would be unrighteous if He did not forgive and justify us. Formerly, if He justified us, He would have been unrighteous; now, if He does not justify us, He would be unrighteous. Formerly, He could not justify us; now, He cannot but justify us. He must justify us because He is righteous and cannot be unrighteous. His righteousness requires Him to justify those who believe. His righteousness cannot change; therefore, the justification that He gives us according to His righteousness cannot change.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Who shall bring a charge against God&rsquo;s chosen ones? It is God who justifies&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:33).</p>
<p>Since God justifies us according to His righteousness, nothing and no one can bring a charge against us. Because God is righteous, the justification we have received is secure, and no one can condemn us again.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Righteousness...the foundation of Your throne&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 89:14).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s throne is built upon righteousness. If there were a problem with God&rsquo;s righteousness, the foundation of His throne would be shaken. This tells us that His righteousness is extremely secure and solid. Since our justification is based upon His secure and solid righteousness, it is equally secure and solid. His righteousness is the foundation of His throne, and it is the basis for our justification. Our justification is as secure as God&rsquo;s throne.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S COVENANT</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;A new covenant&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 8:8).</p>
<p>God saved us not only because of His love, by His grace, and according to His righteousness but also through His covenant. Through the blood shed by the Lord Jesus, God made a covenant with us to save us (Matt. 26:28). His covenant with us is based upon His faithfulness. His faithfulness causes Him to keep His covenant and to be bound by this covenant. Based on this covenant, He must save us, and He must save us to the uttermost.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;I will not profane My covenant, / Nor will I change what has gone forth from My lips&rdquo;</strong> (Psa. 89:34).</p>
<p>God is faithful, and His faithfulness will not fail (v. 33). He will not profane His covenant or change His word. Since He saves us according to His established covenant, according to His word in the New Testament, our salvation cannot be changed. Our salvation is secure and solid because of His covenant and the word of His covenant.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S POWER</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father&rsquo;s hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:29; see also Psa. 89:13).</p>
<p>Our Father is greater than all, so His power is greater than all, and no one can snatch us out of His hand. Therefore, according to His power, our salvation is secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28).</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s life, which is the eternal life, entered into us and brought us into an eternal relationship with God, a relationship of life that we can never break. Since the life of God is eternal, our life relationship with God is also eternal. His eternal life is in us, keeping us from perishing forever and making our salvation eternally secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL BEING</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;With whom is no variation or shadow cast by turning&rdquo;</strong> (James 1:17).</p>
<p>God will not change; He does not even cast a shadow by turning. Since our salvation is out of such a One, how can it change?</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;For I, Jehovah, do not change; therefore you...are not consumed&rdquo;</strong> (Mal. 3:6).</p>
<p>We are not consumed because God does not change. Our salvation is eternally secure because God&rsquo;s being never changes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S REDEMPTION</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Who is he who condemns? It is Christ Jesus who died and, rather, who was raised, who is also at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us&rdquo;</strong> (Rom. 8:34).</p>
<p>Who can erase the eternal efficacy of the redemption of Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection and make His intercession for us of no effect? No one can. No one can ever condemn us again. Our salvation is secure.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for them&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 7:25).</p>
<p>The Lord is always interceding for us, and He is able to save us to the uttermost.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;He became...the source of eternal salvation&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 5:9).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eternal salvation&rdquo;! How sure is this phrase! Moreover, this verse says that the Lord Himself is the source of eternal salvation. Just as He is eternally unchanging, our salvation is eternally unchanging.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;By one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified&rdquo;</strong> (Heb. 10:14).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfected forever&rdquo;! How certain is this phrase! The Lord accomplished redemption once, perfecting us forever. Therefore, we receive His redemption once and are eternally saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S POWER</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;No one shall snatch them out of My hand&rdquo;</strong> (John 10:28).</p>
<p>No one can snatch us out of the Lord&rsquo;s powerful hand, which is the hand of God. His powerful hand makes us eternally secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S PROMISE</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Him who comes to Me I shall by no means cast out&rdquo;</strong> (John 6:37).</p>
<p>The Lord promised that He would not cast out any who come to Him. This promise guarantees that our salvation is eternally secure. In His Word God shows that once we are saved, we have eternal salvation, we are perfected forever, and we will never perish. This is our eternal security. Verses such as John 15:2 and 6, Romans 11:22, Galatians 5:4, Hebrews 6:4-6, and 10:26-27 do not refer to perishing after our salvation; they refer to the consequences in this age of not living according to the Lord&rsquo;s life in our salvation.</p></body></html>
