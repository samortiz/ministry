   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can only say that everything that happened before was God's work; man did not try to do anything.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have Brother Tang's approval and have written to Brother Stephen Kaung, inviting him to come and work among us and to shepherd us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have not received an answer from Brother Kaung yet.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Two</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Dear Brother Shou-ling in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thank and praise the Lord that I, who drifted away in 1938, am now back in the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I was in Hankow, you exhorted me twice in the name of the Lord, but I was still stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, God's love was upon me, and I would like to relate what happened.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In December of last year, I was busy with my own business and with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes I had to work late and did not get home until two or three o'clock in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the night of December 26, I could not sleep, and on the morning of the twenty-seventh, I realized that I had a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By the afternoon, the fever was higher.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>My whole body was weak with chills.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Fortunately, two brothers in my house were doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Another brother next door was also a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They diagnosed that I was infected with some kind of virus, and they suggested that I rest for two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>While I was laying on my bed, the Lord continued to send those who were His to come and visit me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>His love was displayed at every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our God is worthy of praise and thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the afternoon of the thirtieth, one brother came to visit me, and we prayed together.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>While I was praying, my body was numb and my chest was pressed with unspeakable weight.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was painful.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The faith given by God enabled us to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we stopped our prayer, my faith led me to measure my temperature because I believed that God had healed me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I measured it, I found that my lingering temperature was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The terrible virus had left.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brother, my past stubbornness truly offended God and the brothers and sisters, as well as my whole family.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>May the Lord forgive me again because of His beloved Son Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I wish you well, and may peace be unto your house.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brother Yuen How-tsai, January 2, 1939</S>
