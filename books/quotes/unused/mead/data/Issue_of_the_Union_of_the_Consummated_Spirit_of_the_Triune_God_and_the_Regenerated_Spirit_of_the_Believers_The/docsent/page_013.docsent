   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE UNION OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SPIRIT OF THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; 1:12-13; 3:15-16; Matt 16:24; Rom 6:19, 22; 15:16; 2 Pet 1:4; Titus 3:5b; Rom 12:2a; 2 Cor 4:16; Rom 6:4; 2 Cor 3:18; Phil 3:21; Rom 8:29, 30, 23; Eph 4:30; Col 3:4b; 1 Pet 5:10a; 2 Tim 2:10; Heb 2:10 OUTLINE The union of the Spirit of God and the spirit of the believers brings God into man that God and man may be joined and mingled together divinity and humanity blended as one, without a third nature being produced.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In regenerating the believers: The Spirit of God regenerating the believers in their receiving spirit with the life of God that they may become children of God John 3:5-6; 1:12-13.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That, in addition to their natural life, the believers may have the eternal life of God and live by it while denying their natural life John 3:15-16; Matt 16:24.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In sanctifying the believers Rom 6:19, 22; 15:16: Dispensing God's holy nature into the inward parts of the believers to gradually sanctify every inward part with the element of God's holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That the believers may in substance partake of and enjoy God's nature of holiness and thus become holy 2 Pet 1:4.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In renewing the believers Titus 3:5b; Rom 12:2a: Infusing the inward parts of the believers with God's attributes, which are forever new, can never become old, and are everlasting and unfading.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>That by passing through the death of Christ on the cross, the discipline of the Spirit of God in the environment, and the metabolic dispensing of the Spirit as life, the believers may be renewed day by day by putting off the oldness of the old creation and living out the newness of life of the new creation 2 Cor 4:16; Rom 6:4.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In transforming the believers 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 12:2a: Transforming the believers metabolically with the life element of the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man, who passed through death and entered into resurrection, until they are transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another higher degree of glory and are raptured and transfigured to enter into His glory Phil 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the mass reproduction of the firstborn Son of God as the prototype to make every believer a God-man just like Christ, the firstborn Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In conforming the believers Rom 8:29: Conformation is the consummation of the transformation of the believers in the life of Christ as the firstborn Son of God, the first God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Conformation is also the preparation of the believers before the transfiguration and glorification of their body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In glorifying the believers Rom 8:30, 23; Eph 4:30; Col 3:4b; 1 Pet 5:10a; 2 Tim 2:10; Heb 2:10: The work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers begins with His regenerating the believers with the life of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After regenerating the believers, the Spirit of God continues, step by step, with His work of sanctifying, renewing, transforming, and conforming to transfuse the believers with the Triune God Himself as glory, until the glory of God's life saturates the believers and is manifested in their body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus the work of the Spirit of God in glorifying the believers reaches its consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The above six steps are accomplished by the joining of "the Spirit with our spirit" Rom 8:16 as "one spirit" 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this were not so, even though the gospel of God is "powerful" Rom 1:16 , it still would not have any power or accomplish anything in the believers.</S>
