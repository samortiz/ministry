RECEIVING THE SPIRIT THROUGH THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have seen that the Holy Spirit is the Triune God reaching us in a consummate way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When the Holy Spirit reaches us, the Triune God is with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit, however, is abstract and mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, it is important to see that the Spirit is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now if we would live Christ, we need to experience the Spirit within and enjoy the Word without.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In our Christian experience, the Word and the Spirit must always be one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is an utter falsehood to say that we take the Spirit without taking the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without taking the Word, we cannot have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In my experience, I receive the Spirit mostly through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As I contact the Word in a living way, it becomes the Spirit to me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, some take the Bible without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This also is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who wish to grow flowers need both the seeds and the life contained in the seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is impossible to separate the life within the seeds from the seeds themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order to have the life, we must take the seeds.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The relationship between the Word and the Spirit is like that between the seeds and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must have both.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus is both the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is not the Spirit without being the Word, nor the Word without being the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>TWO EXTREMES</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the Spirit, there are two extremes, one found among fundamentalists and the other among Pentecostalists.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A. Fundamentalists</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because they are afraid of the experience of the Spirit, certain fundamental Christians care primarily for Bible doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But to have only the doctrine of the Bible without the Spirit is to have a lifeless body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Spirit is embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the Word may be called the body of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To separate the Spirit from the Word is to have a lifeless body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Spirit is the life content of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apart from the Spirit, the Bible is dead letters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nevertheless, fundamental Christians are often afraid to hear about the experience of Christ, the Spirit, and the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They represent one extreme.</S>
