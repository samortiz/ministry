   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE KNOWING THE HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:6, 4-5 THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To know the spirit is to know it by the sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Even up until this day, no one has ever seen electricity itself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The light of a lamp is not the electricity, but an expression, a sign of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We can know electricity by its signs and expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Also, no one has ever seen the physical life of a person's being, but we can know the physical life by its expression and by certain senses.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the same principle, the spirit is very mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You can't see it, but you can sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You can't see electricity, but when you touch it, you can sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In like manner, you can know the spirit by sensing the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To sense the spirit is the way to know the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SIN IN OUR MEMBERS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because of the fall, man's body was corrupted by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The physical body plus sin equals the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created a body for man, but God didn't create the sinful flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What God created was a pure body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Adam took of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he took it into his body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We know it was taken into his body because it was eaten Gen 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whatever you eat is taken into your body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In nature, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is sin, because it is the tree not only of good but of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since Adam took this tree into his body, Romans 7 tells us clearly that sin is in the members of the body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>20, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Sin is in the members of the body because sin came into the body; therefore, the body is corrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After being corrupted the body became the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the fleshly lusts are in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE MIND, THE FLESH, AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mind is the leading part of the soul, and the soul is our very being, our self.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The body is not the self or our being, but an outward organ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The spirit isn't the self or our being either, but an inward organ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are a being, a human being, a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The soul is a being with two organs the outward organ of the body and the inward organ of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our being, our self, is the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is why the Scripture reveals that the soul is the self in Matthew 16:24-26 and Luke 9:23-25 and that a human being, a person, is called a soul Exo 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If I call you a body, that is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If I call you a spirit, this is also wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A man is not a body or a spirit, but a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The soul is your self, your being, and the mind is the leading part of your being representing your self.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The mind represents the self, the body is the flesh, and our spirit contains the Spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In our spirit is the Triune God Eph 4:6; Gal 2:20; John 14:17 as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Within us there are three parties: Satan as sin is in our flesh Rom 7:17, 18, 20 , God is in our spirit, and the self is in our soul represented by our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>To set the mind on the flesh means to take sides with the flesh, to cooperate with the flesh, to stand with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To set the mind on the flesh is death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To set the mind on the spirit means to take sides with the spirit, to cooperate with the spirit, to stand with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To set the mind on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>DISCERNMENT BY SENSING</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The way to know life and peace is by sensing life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When you take sides with the spirit, cooperate with the spirit, walk in the spirit, and do things by the spirit, you sense life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An example may help to illustrate what the sense of life is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I was a young boy, I attended a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the table there were two kinds of white, fine powder: refined sugar and refined salt.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I put a lot of salt on a certain food, thinking that I was using sugar.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I put the food into my mouth I suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I sensed that the powder I used was not sugar, but salt.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Though my eyes could not discern the difference between the sugar and salt, my taste could.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the way to discern the spirit by sensing.</S>
