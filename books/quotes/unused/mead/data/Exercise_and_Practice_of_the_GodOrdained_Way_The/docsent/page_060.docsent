   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Praying Always</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may continue your talk with him by saying, "To read the Bible is good, but it should be accompanied by another thing our prayer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Our reading should be matched by prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can take the word All Scripture is God-breathed' and simply turn it into prayer, saying, Lord, thank You for all the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank You that all the Scriptures are God-breathed.'</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must learn to pray the words of the Bible in this way."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You should demonstrate how to read the Bible and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You can also read him 1 Thessalonians 5:17-18 "Unceasingly pray; in everything give thanks" and say, "Prayer should always be followed by thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This verse says to pray without ceasing and then to give thanks to God."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can read these two verses and then demonstrate a little bit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will help him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In contacting him in this way, you can open up the conversation to both the reading of the Bible and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Keeping Morning Watch</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After a few days, you must visit this one again.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This time when you arrive, rather than listening to him first, you should say, "Two days ago we talked to you about reading the Bible and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we would like to tell you about another practice which is crucial to our Christian life keeping morning watch."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You can explain to him what morning watch is by saying, "Every day, rise up a little earlier to spend some time with the Lord to read the Bible and converse with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While you are conversing with the Lord, you can tell Him whatever you need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You do not need to do this too long, maybe about ten minutes every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This will be a great help to your Christian life."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You can talk to him about this practice and charge him to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then when you come back to visit again, you can check to see if he is practicing this or not.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Attending the Meetings</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You should also have the time to say, "Another crucial practice of the Christian life is to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 10:25 says that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We Christians are like the bees; none of us can live the Christian life by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There are the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the larger meetings of the church."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BUILDING UP THESE CRUCIAL PRACTICES</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not merely explain or present these four practices to the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need at least one month to help them build up these practices.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every time we go back to visit them, we must check with them concerning these four practices.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They may tell us that they have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One may say that he kept morning watch for three mornings but on the fourth morning he could not rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We need to check with him, "When did you get up?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When did you go to bed?"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one likes to go to bed early.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if you decide to go to bed at 10:30, you may not get to bed until 11:30.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are going to learn to keep our morning watch, we must ask the Lord to grant us His grace and mercy so that we can go to bed earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not go to bed earlier, it will be hard for us to get up earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to try to help the new ones build up their time of morning watch as a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the new ones are to live a healthy Christian life, they must practice these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They must read the Bible, and to some extent they must learn to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Prayer is healthy to their spiritual life, so we must do a lot to help them to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must help them build up a habit of prayer and tell them that to pray is not merely to ask God to do things for us but to breathe God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must also help them to keep morning watch and attend the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must work to build up these practices over quite a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>While we are helping to build up these four practices in the new ones, we will also need to touch other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We must go to the home meetings in a very flexible way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In one visit we can cover two or three things, but with some subjects we must help them over a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With the matter of consecration, we do not need a long time, but with these four practices, we need a longer time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Even one month may not be adequate for building up a new one in these practices.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>While we are working on him concerning these four practices, we can cover other things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Now is the time to practice the home meetings by taking care of those whom you have baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You delivered these babes, so the responsibility is upon your shoulders to go back to them to feed, nourish, and cherish them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not do things without any kind of direction.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You should work for quite a period of time to develop in them these healthy practices that are crucial to the Christian life.</S>
