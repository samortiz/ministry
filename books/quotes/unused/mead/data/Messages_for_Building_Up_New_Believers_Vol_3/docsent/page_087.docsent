   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Swinging between Life and Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At first, some left the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later, the ones who left were, in turn, left behind by others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Originally, those who left the state churches did so because the state churches were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then those who left became dead themselves and were left behind by others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The entire history of Protestantism is a history of being living in name but dead in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is a history that swings back and forth between life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some became living, and some became dead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Not all are dead, for there are always a few who have not defiled themselves, who are the prominent ones chosen and used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are the giants in Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are worthy to walk with the Lord in white.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the entire history of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The church in Thyatira was rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sardis was rebuked as well.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is the way for the believers to go on?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>F. The Sixth Church Philadelphia</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Next comes the sixth church; it has the name Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Phil means love and adelphia means brotherly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Philadelphia means brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Returning to Brotherly Love</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Among the seven churches, this is the only one which does not receive any rebuke from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Roman Catholic Church was rebuked, and so were the Protestant churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only Philadelphia is not rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One only finds praise in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What are the characteristics of Philadelphia?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Revelation 3:8 says, I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the characteristic of Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The characteristic of Thyatira is the teaching of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The characteristic of Sardis is a union between the church and the world and a constant need for separation; it is a continuous struggle between life and death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the characteristic of Philadelphia is brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here is a return to brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is no worldliness here because all are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need to struggle to separate oneself from death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a return to the original state of brotherhood.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we find brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just as Sardis comes out of Thyatira, Philadelphia comes out of Sardis.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Protestants came out of the Roman Catholic Church, and Philadelphia came out of the Protestants.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was clearly a new move of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This new move attracted people from the dead Sardis and put them on the ground of brotherly love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, they stood on the Body ground.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They did not recognize any other relationship except the relationship of brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They did not recognize any other fellowship except the fellowship of love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Keeping the Lord s Word</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Philadelphia had two characteristics: They kept the Lord s word, and they did not deny the Lord s name.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Here was a group of people who were led by God to keep His word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God opened up the Word to them, and others were able to understand His Word through them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They had no creed, doctrine, or tradition, only the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>At the time of Philadelphia, we find a group of people returning fully to the Word of the Lord, who did not recognize any other authority, doctrine, or creed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A man can understand and even preach a doctrine, but this does not mean that he understands the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He can memorize creeds and proclaim his faith in them, but this does not mean that he understands the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord would have given us creeds long ago if the church needed them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today men analyze the Bible and condense its teachings into creeds.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Creeds are limited, but the Bible is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Creeds are simple, while the Bible is complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A foolish man can understand creeds if he studies them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But a foolish man cannot understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Only a certain type of people can understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Only under certain conditions can a man understand God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Creeds open a wide door and anyone can go in. But the door to God s Word is not that wide, and only those with life can enter it.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The door of the creeds is so wide that a smart mind is all one needs to enter it.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But God s Word is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Unless a man has life and is single before the Lord, he will not see or understand His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many people think that God s Word is too narrow.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They want to broaden it so that they can bring more people into it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But those in Philadelphia rejected all creeds and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They turned back to the Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord said, You...have kept My word.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In church history, there was never an age when men understood God s Word more than those in Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In Philadelphia God s Word was given its rightful place.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In other ages men accepted creeds and traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But Philadelphia accepted nothing other than God s Word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It returned to His Word and walked in it.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In church history there was never a time when the ministry of the Word was as rich as that which we find in Philadelphia.</S>
