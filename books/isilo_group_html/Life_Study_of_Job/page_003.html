THE PLACE</H2><P>The book of Job tells us that Job lived in Uz, a city in Edom (Lam. 4:21), west of the Arabian desert.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE FORM OF WRITING</H2><P>The book of Job is poetic in form, with the exception of chapters one and two and the last eleven verses of chapter forty-two. Job is the first of the five poetic books in the Scriptures; the other four are the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE CONTENTS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Expressions of the Sentiments<br>of Godly Men</H2><P>The contents of the book of Job are the expressions of the sentiments of godly men, including Job, his three friends, and the young man Elihu. This book is the record of the speaking of these five parties plus the speaking of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. According to the Experiences of Their Godly Life</H2><P>The book of Job, like the Psalms, consists of the expressions of the sentiments of the speakers according to the experiences of their godly life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Filled with the Principle of Good and Evil</H2><P>Their expressions were uttered before the law was given, yet their sentiments were filled with the principle of good and evil. This is the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Their Logic Being according to the Line<br>of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil</H2><P>Their logic was according to the line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and, based on this, they considered very much God's justice and righteous judgment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. In Relation to the Judgments<br>of God's Government</H2><P>The expression of the sentiments of these godly men are in relation to the judgments of God's government. The debates between Job and his three friends were mainly concerning judgment. They reasoned that Job must have been wrong in some regard or aspect and that the things which happened to him were a judgment from God. They may also have thought that Job's children were wrong and died because of God's judgment. Thus, the contents of this book involve the matter of God's judgment.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Job &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
