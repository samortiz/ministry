   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE THE WAY TO PERFECT A PERSON TALKS 9</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:Morning, January 20, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Swatow, Kwangtung</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prayer: Lord, we are gathered here before You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Enlighten us concerning Your word, and may we touch You from deep within.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, show us that Your word is life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>GOD CARING FOR THE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>MORE THAN FOR THE THINGS</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church the most important thing is the person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The importance of the person far exceeds that of any work.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the world it is just the opposite; there, the work is more important than the person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But for us the person is more important.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Time stands between the two eternities; both creation and redemption are within the span of time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>During the span of time, God does many works.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's main goal, however, is not the works, but to gain persons through the works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God does not work for the sake of working, but for the sake of gaining men through His works.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is not here merely to accomplish a work, but to use His work to gain some people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, our views have to be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Heart Being Proper</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>toward God</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God pays much attention to man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord told the Israelites once that "this people draws near with their mouth, and with their lips they honor Me, yet they remove their heart far from Me" Isa 29:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>From this, we see that what God cares for is man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although many words about the heart are from the Old Testament, we find the Lord quoting them in the New Testament: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind" Matt 22:37 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" Matt 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" Matt 6:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>"But whenever their heart turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away" 2 Cor 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For this reason, a man's heart must be right and proper toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is of course right that we love the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But if we do this without having our hearts aimed at God, such love is not proper.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Gentiles do the right things, they are right only with respect to the things themselves; they are not right with respect to God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Matthew 7 describes a group of people who have done many things for God, but their hearts are not right toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For that reason, they are considered lawless ones v. 23 . If you ask how it could be that a person whose heart is not right can cast out demons, I will tell you that it is indeed possible.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even the Gentiles can cast out demons.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as a person fulfills the natural law, he can get the expected result.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If a man opens the window, air will naturally come in. If a man and a woman are married, naturally they will bear children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even Lot's daughters who committed incest with their father were able to bear children.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man is not right in his heart, he can still preach and can still perform miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as he goes along with the law, it will work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we cannot judge anything by its outward results.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The important thing is where the heart is.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Heart Being Attached to God</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sometimes, troubles arise among the brothers and sisters because some have an improper heart.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some people are caused to stumble because their hearts are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people become disappointed because their hearts are not right.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Among a thousand brothers and sisters, it is difficult to find one or two whose hearts are near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you suffer loss in your business, and your heart is attached to your business, you will be hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Out of the heart are the issues of life Prov 4:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man's heart is like sticky paper; it attaches itself to whatever it touches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A person who loves the Lord will not be moved by anything good or bad, or by any changes in the human life, because his heart is attached to God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Those who have a proper heart will not put blame on others; they will not condemn others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They will not treat others well when others treat them well, and treat others in an evil way when others treat them in an evil way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are all hard-to-deal-with people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If someone is a proper person, he will not be overly subjective toward many things.</S>
