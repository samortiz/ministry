<h2 class="head2">H. Taking Heed Lest We Fall</h2><p>In verse 12 Paul says, &ldquo;So then, let him who thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.&rdquo; Based upon the admonition in verses 5 through 11, the apostle warns the Corinthians not to think they are standing steadfast, with no danger of falling dead as the children of Israel did. The word &ldquo;fall&rdquo; here refers to the children of Israel who failed, those who fell and died in the wilderness. Some Corinthian believers did fall and die because of offending the Lord&rsquo;s body (11:27-30).</p><p>In verse 12 Paul tells the philosophical Corinthians to take heed lest they fall. They may think that they are strong, steady, and standing fast. But Paul warned them not to fall, as the children of Israel did. As we shall see, in chapter eleven Paul points out that those who offended the Lord in the matter of the Lord&rsquo;s table became weak, sick, and some even died. This is to fall. Any New Testament believer who dies without overcoming is one who falls. Paul died, but he did not die defeated. He did not fall in the wilderness. On the contrary, he died overcoming. He was like Joshua and Caleb, who did not die in the wilderness. However, most Christians die as defeated ones. For a Christian to die defeated by sin, the world, the flesh, lust, Satan, or anything evil is to fall in the wilderness. It is actually to be strewn along in the wilderness. This is a very serious matter.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s warning in these verses is a word of righteousness (Heb. 5:13). Today where can you hear such a word of righteousness proclaimed among Christians? Instead of the word of righteousness, there are sugar-coated sermons which often encourage people to practice idolatry. This is a serious situation, and it requires a serious word of warning.</p><h2 class="head2">I. No Temptation That Is Not Common to Man</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;No temptation has taken you except that which is common to man; but God is faithful, Who will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able, but will with the temptation make also the way out, that you may be able to endure it.&rdquo; This verse is a continuation of the warning given in verse 12, indicating that, on the one hand, we should take heed not to be tempted lest we fall and die. On the other hand, God in His faithfulness will not allow any temptation to befall us beyond what we are able to endure, but will always make a way out for us. This word of encouragement follows the strong warning given in the foregoing verses.</p><p>Some readers of 1 Corinthians think that the word temptation in verse 13 means trial or trouble. According to their understanding, this verse is saying that whatever trial we suffer is common to all men. Actually, here Paul does not mean trouble; he means temptation. In Matthew 6:13 the Lord Jesus teaches us to pray both to be delivered from evil and also not to be led into temptation. The evil here includes troubles such as accidents. Temptation refers to things around us which tempt us. Thus, we need to pray that the Lord would daily deliver us from troubles and not lead us into temptation. We realize that we are weak and cannot bear temptation. In 10:13 Paul is speaking of temptation, not troubles or trials.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s word in verse 13 is both a comfort and a correction to the Corinthians. The Corinthians may have thought that the temptations were too strong to be resisted. But Paul points out that no temptation has taken them except that which is common to man. He also says that God is faithful and will not allow them to be tempted beyond what they are able to bear, but with the temptation will provide a way out so that they may be able to endure it. This is a word of promise and of encouragement. However, it leaves the responsibility for being tempted with us, not with God. When we are tempted, we should never blame God for the temptation. According to this verse, the responsibility for being tempted rests on our shoulders. At the same time, we may be encouraged to know that the faithful God will provide a way out for us.</p>
