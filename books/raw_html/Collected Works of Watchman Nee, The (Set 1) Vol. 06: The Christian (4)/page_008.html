<P>Then men took Christ, bound, from Annas to Caiaphas. The Bible says that He was bound as a criminal. He stood in the position of a sinner, and He suffered what sinners deserve, in order to save them. When He was before the high priest, "they spit in His face and beat Him with their fists, and others slapped Him" (Matt. 26:67). Did He commit any sin? No one could convict Him of sins. He endured this treatment for no other reason than our sin!</P><P>Later, men brought our loving Lord Jesus to the council for another trial. There He suffered many malicious offenses and unbearable pain from the world! He wants to save us, the sinners, so He suffered to this extent. We inflicted these sufferings on Him!</P><P>The world mistreated Him without a cause. But it did not stop here. They did not give up until they had put Him to death. He was delivered to Pontius Pilate the governor and was maligned with the crime of rebellion. But God proved His Son's guiltlessness through Pontius Pilate. Three times the governor repeated that He was innocent. Why, then, was He crucified? He was found guiltless. Why should a guiltless One need to suffer punishment for sin? There is no other reason than that there are sins in the world, and the world is sinful. "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him" (2 Cor. 5:21). The sinless Jesus Christ was crucified because of your sins. Will you still harden your heart and refuse to receive Him as your Savior? O Lord, have pity on us!</P><P>In order to absolve himself of any responsibility, Pilate delivered the Lord Jesus to Herod. There He suffered the despising and mockery of the soldiers. They put a scarlet robe on Him. Did they respect the Lord Jesus? No! The Bible says that they mocked Him. O Savior Jesus, my sin afflicted You! You endured the insults and bore the shame because You love me. I want to believe in You and love You this very moment! Finally, they took the Lord Jesus back into the common hall of the governor. My dear sinners, do you realize that He never closed His eyelids during the long night until daybreak? He was bound by men and taken here and there. He was dragged over many miles through the night. How unbearable was the grinding He suffered! He bore it all because He loves you and He loves me. Although Pilate acknowledged His innocence, he crucified Him in the end against the law.</P><P>"And Pilate...scourged Jesus and delivered Him up to be crucified" (Mark 15:15). "Scourging" seems to be a common word, but how much suffering is involved! What does it mean? A Roman whip had a wooden handle and at the end of the wooden handle were many leather thongs. At the end of each thong were heavy metal pieces. The victim would be tied to a wooden stake, with his back bared to the whipper who held the wooden handle and whipped with the leather thongs. Three stripes alone could rip open the victim's body. For our sins, the glorious Christ suffered scourging on our behalf. Did the cruel Roman soldiers care about our Savior? No, they were just like all the other sinners. "Swift are their feet to shed blood" (Rom. 3:15). How sad that our Lord Jesus was put into their hands. But thank God! "By whose bruise you were healed" (1 Pet. 2:24). You who are wounded and sick in soul, come with haste to be healed, for He has already received the bruise.</P><P>"And they clothed Him in purple and wove a thorny crown and put it around His head. And they began to salute Him: Rejoice, King of the Jews!" (Mark 15:17-18). This kind of mocking and jeering was intolerable and shameful! The world did not give the Lord Jesus a glorious crown but a crown of thorns. The Lord Jesus bore the curse for us! He wore a crown of thorns which come from the curse of the world's sins. How pointed and sharp were those thorns! How could His perfect forehead endure such piercing? Yes, He was willing to endure pain and shed His blood because He knew that if He did not suffer, we would perish forever.</P><P>"And they beat His head with a reed" (Mark 15:19). The Lord Jesus had a crown of thorns. Surely, this smiting with a reed would push the thorns into His flesh more deeply. As God, Jesus Christ had never experienced this manner of piercing pain. He took man's place and died on the cross because of His love for man, saving man from the eternal perdition of the lake of fire. For this reason, He endured such unspeakable suffering. The soldiers, as instruments of the world's sins, not only afflicted Christ's body, but even afflicted His soul. They "spat at Him. And kneeling down, they bowed before Him" (Mark 15:19). After they finished mocking Him, they led Him away to be crucified.</P><P>There a soldier offered Jesus wine, mingled with gall and myrrh, to drink. It is said that if one drank this wine, the pain of crucifixion would be lessened. But our Savior would not drink it. He did not escape any suffering. He had already counted the cost before He came. He was full of love for all the sinners of the world. He was willing to bear all the affliction and all the punishment for our sins. He tasted death for sinners once for all that we might have eternal life. He was willing to take the place of sinners by tasting all the bitterness of the punishment of sins, so that sinners might have the joy of His righteousness.</P><P>At Calvary men crucified Him. Did just the Roman soldiers and Jewish council crucify Jesus Christ? In reality our sins crucified Him! A cross is constructed of a horizontal and a vertical piece of wood. The soldiers laid the Lord Jesus on the cross, propped open His hand, and nailed His hand to the wood with large iron nails. His flesh was broken, His blood flowed, and the pain pierced His inward parts! The same was done to His other hand and feet! Then they erected the cross, and all the weight of the Lord's body hung on those iron nails! Was God too severe in judging the Lord Jesus this way? No! The sins of the world are truly heavy! Our sins are numerous! The proper punishment for sins is eternal suffering in hell. The suffering of the Lord Jesus on the cross was what we sinners should have suffered. God's judgment of Him was not too severe because we should have suffered such punishment. The work of the Lord Jesus' death for sinners is accomplished. Therefore, "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God" (John 3:18). Our sins are like iron nails; they have crucified the Lord Jesus. When the Lord was crucified on the cross, He bled, and His blood soaked the iron nails. Our sin has crucified Him, but His blood covers our sin! This is salvation, yes, what a salvation! "And the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin" (1 John 1:7b).</P>
