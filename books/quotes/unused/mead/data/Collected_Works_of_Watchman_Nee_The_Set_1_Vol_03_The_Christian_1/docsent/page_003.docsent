   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEDITATIONS ON GENESIS CHAPTER ONE GENESIS AND GEOLOGY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We believe that the entire Bible is the Word of God, and every word of it is inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A very grievous thought in the mind of godly ones is that men have despised and opposed His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's children are grieved because men do not respect God's statutes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Among the sixty-six books of the Bible, Genesis has been subjected to the most doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who oppose the Bible often try to overturn God's clear revelation with geological ages and prehistoric discoveries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The evidences in geology prove to them that the earth has been in existence for tens of thousands of years, and that the record of six thousand years of history in the Bible is untrustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the name of science, the world hurls its attacks on the book of Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many dear brothers in the Lord are not that scholarly the author being one of them and become lost in this storm.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although geology does not form part of our meditation, for the benefit of all, we will study the Word of God by the Lord's grace at the commencement of our meditation and will consider how perfect is His Word, so that we can silently behold His beauty in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Genesis is God's revelation, while geology is man's invention.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God knows the whole truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As such, His revelation can never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man only sees in part.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As such, his conjectures are not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we place Genesis side by side with geology, we should follow Genesis and not geology, because it is God who stands behind Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there are any basic differences between Genesis and geology, the error must be on the side of geology.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The authority of the Bible is undisputed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everything that is contrary to the Bible is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank God our Father that He has given us such a complete revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If there are any incompatibilities between God and man, we would rather give up man and accept God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If there is no incompatibility, should not feeble human beings all the more believe in the revelation from heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Men often laugh at the ridiculous stories of creation circulated among the Chinese, the Babylonians, and other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No scientist has to spend much effort to refute these myths.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason is that there is not much weight to these traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why they have not attracted much attention.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But men's attitudes towards the Bible are very different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The very fact that they have tried their best to resist the Bible proves the power of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They cannot treat the Bible the same as the traditions of the nations because they have recognized the extraordinary nature of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All those who have read Genesis 1 cannot fail to marvel at the beauty of its record.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How ordinary it is, yet how marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is a plain record and contains no theory or arguments to prove its authenticity.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The writer of the book was not bound by the book, but was transcendent above its record.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The true author of the book is the One who is far above the universe it describes God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Had the recorder of the book, Moses, written this book according to his own learning and ideas, his thoroughly Egyptian-trained intellect would surely have been influenced by the Egyptian theory of creation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet who can detect a trace of Egyptian philosophy in Genesis 1?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why is this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is because God was the One who inspired Moses to do the writing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Otherwise, how could Moses know that the land came out of the water?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is, of course, a fact established by geology and is a modern discovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Had Moses not been inspired, it would be difficult to explain this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As to the development of life on earth, although the Bible does not support the theory of evolution, it does not altogether reject the fact that there was a progression.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, there were aquatic organisms, and then there was man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Would not a scientist marvel at the record of Moses?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The omniscient God must surely have given inspiration according to facts; those who were inspired by such an omniscient God cannot be in error.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet the Bible is not a textbook of science.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Its goal is to guide sinners "unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus" 2 Tim 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, the Bible does not contain any scientific errors.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If there are any contradictions with science, it is either a misinterpretation of the Scripture or a misjudgment of science.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many of the definitive statements by geologists in the past have been overturned!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many of their assertions have been proven wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Cummings said, "Geology has made mistakes in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is possible that it will be wrong again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The hasty and loud assertions by those who are not too familiar with its theories may be proved inaccurate again."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since the Bible is not a science textbook, it only mentions the "whats" of creation without mentioning the "whys."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Science is interested in the "whys."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Of course, in many cases it is successful in doing this.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But one must not overturn the "whats" with theoretical "whys" just because man's finite mental research has come into conflict with God's record.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What God said are the facts because He knows everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the world wants to study what God has said and why He has said it, it must not hold on to its own ideas while rejecting God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is a good thing to have wisdom, but there is one kind of foolishness which is more blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Among Christians, there is a popular theory that Genesis 1:1 is a kind of general introduction, and that the work of the six days is actually an expansion of the record of verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, they consider the words "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth" as merely a subject of Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They say that in the first sentence the writer wrote down a summary of what he was about to say, after which he went at length into an explanation of this sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After telling us that God created the heaven and the earth, Genesis goes on to tell us the condition of the earth after creation, and how He created light, air, the land, the plants, and the animals day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This popular theory considers Genesis 1 as a record of the creation of the universe, and that the universe was created out of desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we study the first chapter of the Bible carefully, we will see the error in this supposition!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This erroneous supposition, not the Bible itself, has put the church into a great debate with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This supposition gives men the excuse to say that Genesis is incompatible with geology and casts doubts in the minds of many young people concerning the accuracy of the Bible.</S>
