   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE STANDING BOARDS AND THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF GOD S DWELLING PLACE Scripture Reading: Exo 25:8; 26:15, 26-30; 29:45-46; 40:17 THE CENTRAL REVELATION IN GENESIS AND EXODUS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we read Genesis and Exodus, we need to pay attention to the central revelation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without this revelation, it is not easy to see God s intention in Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Jacob is the father of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The crucial point with Jacob is that he saw Bethel in the revelation that he received from God 28:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many years later God told Jacob to go to Bethel 35:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Bethel means the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God wanted to obtain His house with Jacob, His chosen one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While Jacob was fleeing from his brother, he was homeless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, God did not lead him to care for his own house but rather to care for God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God led Jacob to focus on Bethel, which is the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The main item in relation to Jacob is God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God chose Jacob out of thousands of people in order to gain a house.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God wanted to obtain a dwelling place on earth through Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, God desires to gain a dwelling place, a house, on earth through His chosen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the beginning of Exodus Jacob s descendants, the children of Israel, were slaves in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, God wanted to deliver them out of the land of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The children of Israel were enslaved in Egypt and were oppressed and afflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They needed God s deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Perhaps they never thought of God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They thought of their need, but perhaps they did not consider God s need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They may have thought only of their problems, that is, that they were oppressed and afflicted.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They did not know that God wanted to obtain a dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They knew that God cared for them and would deliver them from the land of Egypt, but they did not know why God would deliver them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not only were the children of Israel ignorant of the reason for God s deliverance, but even Bible readers throughout the generations have not seen the purpose of God s deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GOD DESIRING TO DWELL</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>IN THE MIDST OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL,</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TO HAVE A DWELLING PLACE AMONG THEM</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I received the Lord s salvation before I was twenty years old; that was thirty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since then I have been pursuing to know the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have read many expositions and commentaries on the book of Exodus, but I have yet to read a book that explicitly says that God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt so that He might obtain a dwelling place among them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have never read a book that says this clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes there may be one or two sentences in a book that elude to such a purpose, but not in a clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must see that the main reason God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt was not only because they were suffering oppression and affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt because He intended to build a dwelling place among them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Exodus 25:8 says that God desired to dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea and journeyed to the foot of Mount Sinai.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There God told them that He wanted to dwell among them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God said, I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will be their God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell in the midst of them; I am Jehovah their God 29:45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God seemed to be saying that He delivered the children of Israel so that He might obtain a dwelling place, a house, in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, we should never think that the tabernacle was the extent of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The tabernacle was only a sign, a symbol.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must see that God s house was Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God did not want to dwell in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God wanted to dwell in the midst of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In other words, the children of Israel were God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>GOD DELIVERING US OUT OF THE WORLD</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>FOR A POSITIVE AND GLORIOUS PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The delivery of the children of Israel out of Egypt is a type in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As God s chosen ones, we are today s Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We are God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God delivered us out of the world, just as He delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before we were saved, we felt that we were desolate and suffering in the world because our life was vain and without hope.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But God saved us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God saved us out of the world not merely to deliver us from the afflictions of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He saved us for a positive and glorious goal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God saved us because He wants us to be built up to become His house, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God desires that we be built up to be His house.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After the Israelites left Egypt, they received a revelation from God at the foot of Mount Sinai, and according to that revelation they built a tabernacle as God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This signifies that the children of Israel were built up as God s house.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the first day of the first month in the second year, the tabernacle was erected, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This was God coming to dwell in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God dwelt in the midst of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first chapter of Exodus speaks of the Israelites being slaves in Egypt, and the last chapter speaks of the Israelites being God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a very clear picture.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Exodus uses forty chapters to present this picture.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In chapter 1 the Israelites were ill-treated in the hand of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They were enslaved and making bricks for Pharaoh s cities.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, by the last chapter of Exodus, they were the glorious dwelling place of God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God dwelt in their midst, and the glory of God filled their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We think that God rescued us from afflictions and disasters so that our lives would be meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, this is not God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God has a glorious and positive goal related to His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He intends to build us up to be His dwelling place, His house, so that He can fill this house for His expression.</S>
