   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO THE WORD S INCARNATION AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SON S LIVING ON THE EARTH Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 7:29; 6:46; 17:8; Matt 1:18, 20; 1 Tim 3:16; Col 2:9; John 16:15a; 1:14a; 2:21; 14:10a, 11a; 17:21; 10:30; 17:22; 8:29; 16:32; 6:57a, 5:17, 19; 10:25; 5:30; 6:38; 14:24; 7:16-17; 12:49-50; 7:18; 14:7-9; Matt 3:16-17; Luke 4:18a; Matt 4:1; 12:28 THE WORD S INCARNATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first crucial item of God s New Testament economy is the incarnation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Strictly speaking, the incarnation is the incarnation of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It does not say that Christ became flesh or that God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible tells us that the Word, who was God John 1:1 , became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Word is God s definition, and since it is God s definition it is God s embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is abstract and invisible since God is Spirit John 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our thought is abstract and invisible, but when we put our thought into words these words become the definition of our thought, the very embodiment of our thought.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The word is the definition, the expression, and the embodiment of our thought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If I spoke to you for one hour, you would know what my thought was because my thought is embodied in my word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Word Becoming Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Word as God s definition, God s expression, and God s embodiment, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Word, which was God s definition and God s embodiment, needed to be embodied further in a Person, and this Person was God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the Word became flesh, the very embodiment of God became a Person by the name of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This Person is the embodiment of the Word, which Word was the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this way we may say that God has been embodied twice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God was embodied in the Word before His incarnation John 1:1 , and the Word was embodied in a living Person who was the Man, Jesus Christ Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sent by the Father and with the Father</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the Word became flesh, He was sent by God and with God John 7:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the sent One came, He came with the sending One.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Son came by becoming a man, He came with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>According to John 6:46 and 17:8, the Son came from God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Greek preposition translated from is para which means by the side of.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, the sense here in the Greek is from with.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Darby has a note in his New Translation on John 6:46 which also indicates that the sense in the Greek is from with.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Son came not only from the Father, but also with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While He is from the Father, He is still with the Father John 8:16, 29; 16:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In John 8:29 the Lord says, He who sent me is with me, which indicates that the Father sent the Son from with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Son came, He did not leave the Father in the heavens on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is why the Bible tells us that everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also 1 John 2:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even in our experience today, when we call Lord Jesus, we have the deep sensation that the Father is right in us Eph 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a young believer I was taught to address my prayer to the heavenly Father, and that sometimes I might address my prayer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was also told never to address my prayer to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I could only pray to the Father and sometimes to the Lord through the means, the instrument, of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Based on this teaching, whenever I knelt down to pray, I had to think about whom I was going to address my prayer to.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we initially received the Lord Jesus, though, we had the sensation that He was near to us Phil 4:5; James 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We spontaneously addressed Him in our prayer in an intimate way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may have said, Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You are so dear, precious, sweet, and real to me.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank You, Lord Jesus, that You died for me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I love You, Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It was not until we received some theological help that we began to address the Father on the throne in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, when we pray in a spontaneous and intimate way to our dear Lord Jesus, we have a deep sensation that the Father is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We pray to the Lord Jesus, yet we have the sensation that the Father is here.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our concept has been that when the Son came to the earth, He left the Father sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all must see that when the Father sent the Son, He sent the Son with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Son indwells us 2 Cor 13:5 and the Father does also Eph 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus told Philip in John 14:9, He who has seen Me has seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While the Lord Jesus was speaking to Philip, He furthermore declared that the Father was in Him and that He was in the Father 14:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This shows that when we have the Son, we have the Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even the Son is the Father Isa 9:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must also realize that while the Father is with the Son and in the Son, He is also on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The two are distinct, yet not separate.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is a divine mystery which we cannot fathom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the one hand, the three in the Godhead coexist and on the other hand, they coinhere.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They mutually indwell each other and interpenetrate one another.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Electricity provides us with a good example of such a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The electricity which we are enjoying in our room is the same electricity in the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is simultaneously at the power plant and also in our room.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In like manner, God the Father was within Jesus on the earth and at the same time He was on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should not be bothered by this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We need to realize that with the infinite God there is no element of time or space.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because He is the eternal God, He is above time and space and not limited by them.</S>
