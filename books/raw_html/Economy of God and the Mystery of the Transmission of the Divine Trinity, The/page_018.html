<h2 class=head2>Our Understanding concerning the Kingdom of God Being Incomplete</h2><p>In the past we had a considerable amount of knowledge concerning the kingdom of God, and although our understanding was not wrong, it was definitely incomplete. In our understanding God’s kingdom was merely God’s reigning. This kind of understanding was based upon human realization more than upon God’s revelation. If the kingdom of God is merely God’s reigning and the realm of God’s reigning, then this means that it is God controlling man. For example, when you are going to steal, He would not let you; when you are going to lose your temper, He would not allow you; when you are furious and are going to speak some angry words, He would stop you; when you are going to do a bad thing or say a bad word, He would warn you first, and if you refuse to listen, then He would chastise you. This kind of understanding and realization about the kingdom of God is too narrow.<p>Suppose you have a monkey and you want to teach the monkey how to enter into the human kingdom. With this intention, you may take a whip in your hands and try to teach the monkey to act like a man by using its two front legs as two hands to eat food and do other things. When the monkey does not obey your instructions, then you may whip the monkey. I am afraid that this is our common understanding of God’s reigning, that every day there is a “whip” regulating us from outside. In actuality, God’s reigning is not an outward matter but a matter of life. If a monkey could be regenerated, born again, to become a man and have the human life, this life would automatically regulate the monkey from within to live like a man. In this way, the monkey would automatically and naturally enter into the human kingdom. If this happened, then to try to make the monkey to live and walk like a monkey again would be a suffering to the monkey. Therefore, it is altogether a matter of the innate ability of life, not a matter of outward teaching and regulation.<p>Every kind of life has its particular nature and ability. Take the banana tree as an example. You do not need to worry that a banana tree will grow round bananas. If you were to say to the banana tree, “Please make sure that you do not grow round bananas but that you grow long bananas,” the banana tree, if it could speak, would answer, “Thank you for your concern! However, there is no need for you to exhort me, because the banana life in me has the nature and ability to automatically regulate me and cause me to grow bananas in the shape of bananas.” In the same principle, you do not need to make demands of, or teach, the apple tree or the pear tree. They will spontaneously grow fruit in the shape of apples and pears respectively.<h2 class=head2>The Kingdom of God Being God Himself, the Life of God</h2><p>We must have a clear understanding of the kingdom of God. God’s kingdom is God Himself, and God’s kingdom has God as its content. Moreover, this content is Jesus Christ, who is God incarnated to be a man and who is God Himself as the reality of the kingdom of God. John 3:3 says, “Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” God’s kingdom is a divine realm, and man must have the life of God to enter into it. As we said before, life itself is a kingdom, a world, and a regulating element. Similarly, God’s kingdom is God Himself, and God Himself is life, having the nature, ability, and shape of the divine life, which forms the realm of God’s reigning.
