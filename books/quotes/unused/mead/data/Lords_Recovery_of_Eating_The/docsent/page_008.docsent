   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR BUILDING UP A LIFE OF CALLING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UPON THE NAME OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Deut 4:7; Psa 99:6; Isa 12:2-6; Acts 7:59; 22:16 I. CALLING ON THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING THE WAY TO ENJOY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have already seen clearly that eating the Lord is the way to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Eating the Lord, which is a spiritual expression, is really calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Calling on the Lord is our way to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This light, this wonderful fact, was buried for many years among the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For many generations, although many were seeking God, they did not see definitely that calling on the Lord s name is the way to enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you read the whole Bible carefully, you will see that this matter of calling on the Lord was already there in the Old Testament; it began with Enosh, the third generation of mankind Gen 4:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen also in Lamentations 3:55-56 that our calling on the Lord is a heavenly breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we call on the Lord s name, we begin to exhale, and with the exhaling there is the inhaling.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way of breathing, we take in the fresh air.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We can often use physical things as illustrations of spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To enjoy the Lord in our spirit is like breathing the air physically.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as your body takes in fresh air by breathing, so also your spirit inhales the Lord when you call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe that all of us have had this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever we truly open to the Lord and call on His name, we have the sense of the Lord s presence within us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The more you call, the more you receive the supply of the Lord; the more you call, the more you are watered by Him; the more you call, the more you are filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord is the Lord of all!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord comes into us, whatever we need, He is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is all that we need, and He supplies all of our needs.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Deuteronomy Moses told the people of God that our God Jehovah is near all those who call on Him 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Do you want God to be near to you?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you want to have the presence of God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then you must call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Try it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether you are sitting at home, walking on the way, riding in a car, eating a meal, or even talking with people, when you call, O Lord! the Lord is right in front of you.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is neither superstition nor imagination.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You must practice calling on the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The translation in the Chinese Bible of call on is pray .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Actually, call on is closer to the meaning in the original language than pray .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To call is not only to pray but also to call out with a loud voice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, if my house is on fire and I come to you to tell you about it and to ask for your help, this would be what it is like to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if I call out loudly, Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Fire!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Come quickly!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>, this is what it is like to call.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those who have the experience can testify that calling is more practical than praying.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For instance, when a sister s child is disobedient, she brings the child s name before the Lord by calling.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After thus calling on the Lord, whether or not the Lord answers her prayer is a secondary matter; the most important thing is that she has inhaled the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In this way she is touched by the Lord from within, and she receives His supply.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every one of us must practice calling on the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I know that to this day many Christians can only pray but cannot call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is easy for them to pray silently, but it is very hard for them to call out audibly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I am concerned that even some of the brothers and sisters here at this time do not agree with calling.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One time after I had spoken on the matter of calling in a certain locality, several sisters came to me, saying, Brother Lee, is our God deaf that we have to call by shouting?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I told them, Sisters, I don t like to refute your argument, but I can tell you a fact: Call on the Lord and you will sense sweetness; call on the Lord and you will be watered; call on the Lord and you will touch Him!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Would you like to try?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I also said to them, If I argue on the ground of your way of reasoning, you will not win, because the Bible tells us that God knows our needs before we ask Him Matt 6:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Shall we then not even pray?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, we call loudly not because God is deaf but because it is profitable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Lamentations 3:55 says, I called upon Your name, O Jehovah, / From the lowest pit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When your wife gives you trouble at home, you get into a low pit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At such a time praying is of no avail; you need to call.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If you call out loud a few times when you are pressed, you will be able to break through and rise above your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Often your calling on the Lord s name is for the demons to hear so that they can be driven off.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When you are about to lose your temper, you have no time to pray, but you can quickly call on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Calling on the Lord is the best way to chase away the temper-losing demon and the trouble-making demon.</S>
