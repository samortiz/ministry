   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Clear concerning the Contents</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of God s Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we will consider salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Salvation is God Himself coming to us to be our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Salvation includes forgiveness of sins, cleansing from sins, justification, reconciliation to God, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is a person saved and then justified and forgiven of his sin?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is a person saved and then cleansed by the blood and reconciled to God?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Or is a person saved and then regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Which is the first item that we experience: justification, forgiveness of sins, cleansing from sins, reconciliation, regeneration, or salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Is a person regenerated and then saved, or is he saved and then regenerated?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must remember that being saved is the last item.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When helping others to be saved, we must be clear concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of you may think that it is good enough to lead people to salvation and question why you need to learn these items.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have seen many believers who led people to salvation but were unable to help them advance in life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There have been powerful evangelists who have not cared for the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, those whom they brought to salvation did not have much growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>While preaching the gospel, one evangelist spoke about the precious blood washing his heart and the precious blood leaking out.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many people were saved because his spirit was strong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, it was difficult for those who were saved to be led further in the growth in life because his understanding of the truth was not accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Shangtung Province of northern China many believers in the Pentecostal movement were able to lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the content of their preaching was shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>While bringing people to their service on the Lord s Day, they would sing a folk chorus: You are busy, and I am busy too.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You are busy burning incense, and I am busy going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ones who were saved could not understand what the growth in life had to do with going to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since they were taught that they were going to heaven, it was very difficult for them to advance in life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, as we preach the gospel to bring people to salvation, we must not use the Scriptures carelessly or speak the truth inaccurately; otherwise, those who are led to salvation will not be able to progress.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This can be likened to learning English.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If your teacher is so careless that you can neither differentiate nor pronounce the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, you will not be able to learn English.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, learning to recognize and clearly pronounce each letter of the alphabet will be a solid foundation toward your learning English.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I learned English as a young boy, my teacher was Cantonese.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, my spoken English has a Cantonese accent.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not until I entered college that I was taught by Americans.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By that time it was not so easy for me to change my accent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, as the young people begin to serve the Lord, they must learn all the basic lessons in a solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they learn the lessons well, it will be a great help to them in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have studied the contents of the Lord s salvation for fifty-five years.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 1938 I led the brothers and sisters in Chefoo to study forty-two topics of the crucial truths in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 1949 I studied it with the saints in Taipei, and I added another eighteen topics.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These sixty topics, including the relevant verses, were later published in a set of books.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This compilation is entitled Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, volumes 1 through 6.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In these books the matter of God s salvation is thoroughly discussed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first item of God s salvation is forgiveness of sins Acts 10:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The second item is cleansing from sins 1 John 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we are cleansed, God justifies us Rom 3:26 , and we are released from our sins Rev 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, we are reconciled to God Rom 5:10 , and we are regenerated 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At this point, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Bible says, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved Rom 10:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The word saved includes forgiveness, cleansing, justification, release, and reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All of these matters are accomplished in the twinkling of an eye.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Spirit of God enters into us, and we are regenerated and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, there is still the matter of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are two different stages of sanctification: sanctification before salvation and sanctification after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Romans 6:19 and 22 stress sanctification after salvation, that is, after justification.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First Corinthians 6:11 speaks of sanctification before salvation, that is, before justification.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This verse says, But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to this verse, sanctification is placed after forgiveness and cleansing, being washed, but before justification.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, we can say that God s salvation includes seven items: forgiveness, cleansing, sanctification, justification, release, reconciliation, and regeneration, and then the eighth and last item salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we preach the gospel, we should speak according to this truth, not carelessly.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we do not lay a good foundation, it will be difficult to shepherd people in the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not a small thing; we must learn it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>First Peter 1:2 also speaks of sanctification before salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This verse says that we were chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to this verse, sanctification should be the first item of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God chose us in eternity, in time the Holy Spirit separates us through His sanctifying work, and then the blood is sprinkled on us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After we are sprinkled with the blood, God forgives us and cleanses us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He also justifies us, releases us from our sins, and reconciles us to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then God regenerates us, and the result is our being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hence, according to 1 Peter 1 sanctification is the first item that we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This fellowship is to show you that it is worthwhile to study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we do not study the truth thoroughly, the truth will not regulate us when we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To say that the precious blood washes our heart is not accurate, because Hebrews 10:22 says that the precious blood does not wash our heart but our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our conscience represents the law of God; the law of God corresponds to our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Before God the precious blood washes us of our sins on the basis of the law, and within us the precious blood washes us of all our guilty feelings within our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The blood does not wash our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The heart is deceitful above all things, / And it is incurable Jer 17:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Only regeneration can renew and transform our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Medical students are required to spend several years studying fundamental courses concerning the structure and composition of the human body.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A medical student must acquire this basic knowledge so that he will not make mistakes in his diagnosis or prescription.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Likewise, when we go out to preach the gospel, we should not be incompetent doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We need to learn diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>There is no end to our learning.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The young ones must receive a solid basic training before going out.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Then they will not make many mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we are clear concerning the contents of God s salvation, we will have confidence when we preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When we speak concerning regeneration, we will remember that regeneration comes after six items.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is not until a person is reconciled with God that the Spirit of God can enter into him and put God s life in him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Then a person is regenerated and saved.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Salvation is the last item.</S>
