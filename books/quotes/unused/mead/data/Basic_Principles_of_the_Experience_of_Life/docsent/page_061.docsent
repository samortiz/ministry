   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED OF CONSECRATION FOR ALL THE DEALINGS AND FOR CARING FOR THE INNER ANOINTING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The fellowship, the cross, and the blood are all related to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In all things we need to care for the inner anointing and always go along with the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To go along with the inner anointing is simply to follow the Lord, obey the Lord, submit to the Lord, and always keep ourselves in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It also means that we are walking according to the spirit and in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the Christian walk and the Christian life, and it is a requirement for Christian service and work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have no freedom, no liberty, to act by what we feel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have only the liberty, the freedom, in full to act by what we sense of the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This lesson of the anointing goes along with all the dealings that we have seen: dealing with the flesh, dealing with the self, dealing with the conscience, dealing with the world, and dealing with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It would be wonderful if we would learn the lessons of these dealings and take care of the inner anointing!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no need of great numbers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If only a small number of brothers and sisters would learn the lessons of the dealings and care for the inner anointing, the whole world will be turned upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The almighty, omnipotent God will have a free way to get through.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who learn the lessons of the dealings and learn how to care for the inner anointing will be the fire that burns in our current situation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The power, the impact, and even the authority depend upon these dealings and the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us have a real consecration, telling the Lord, "Lord, in these days I consecrate myself to You to learn all the lessons of the dealings with the flesh, the self, the conscience, the world, and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moreover, I wish to pay any price to go along with the inner anointing."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do this, we cannot tell how far the Lord will go through us, and we do not know what wondrous things will come out through us in these last days.</S>
