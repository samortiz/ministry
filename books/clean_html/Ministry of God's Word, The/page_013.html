<p>Let us again consider Paul&rsquo;s condition in 1 Corinthians 7. Verse 6 says, &ldquo;But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command.&rdquo; Paul was saying that even though he agreed with the proposition, the matter did not originate from him as a command. He was very clear concerning the degree of activity within him. He agreed with the matter, but he would not make this a command. We have to observe the fineness and tenderness in Paul&rsquo;s inner registrations. He made a very clear distinction here. He was not only clear that the proposition was acceptable; he also was clear that it was not a command that he initiated but a concession to others&rsquo; ideas. When we come to verse 40, we see that this was the word of the Spirit of God. The Spirit of God gave His consent to Paul&rsquo;s word. Paul felt that such a proposal was acceptable, and then the Spirit felt the same. God was fully involved in Paul&rsquo;s tender feelings. When we were on the subject of God&rsquo;s authority, we pointed out the tremendous significance of the Lord Jesus entrusting His name to us. In the same way God has entrusted His word to us. This is also a tremendous matter. Suppose a person is troubled by difficulties and seeks our help. We may say to a young brother, &ldquo;Go and say something to this man.&rdquo; The young brother may say, &ldquo;I do not know what to say.&rdquo; We may respond, &ldquo;You can say anything. Whatever you say can be counted as our words. You can say whatever you want to him, and we will acknowledge it as our opinion.&rdquo; This would be a tremendous charge, but it could result in great damage. If there is any problem with the brother, we could not trust him in this way.</p>
<p>This is what happens to ministers of the word today. God does not piece His message together word by word, hand it over to us, and then ask us to memorize it. It would not be difficult for us to memorize a message. It would merely require God to say a word or a sentence and then for us to repeat the same word or sentence. If a message has six hundred words, our responsibility would be over if we could recite all six hundred words. But God does not want us to convey His message in this manner. His intention is to put His word into us, that is, for us to take it in as living water and then to let it flow out of us. He gives us a light, a burden, and then a few clear words to speak to others. Those who can be used will be useful to Him, and those who cannot be used will not be useful to Him. It is as if the God of heaven has commissioned us to speak for Him on earth, yet the same God allows us to say whatever we want to say. Of course, those who know God would not dare say anything rashly.</p>
<p>The responsibility of a minister of the word is not a small one. When a man stands up to speak for God, he has to draw from his feelings, thoughts, and opinions. He has to have the proper judgments and proposals. Therefore, his responsibility is very great. If his feelings are wrong, his speaking will be wrong. If his thoughts, proposals, and opinions are wrong, his speaking will also be wrong. If his mind, feelings, opinions, and judgments are untrustworthy or if his heart and his spirit are unreliable, his words will be unreliable. If this is so, how can he call himself a minister of God&rsquo;s word? This presents a fundamental problem. A man must be so thoroughly dealt with by God that his feelings become fine and tender. His feelings must represent God&rsquo;s feelings. While these feelings certainly belong to him and are independent of outside influence, they are attached to God at the same time. Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 7 is not a small matter.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 7:7 Paul said that he wished. The same Greek word is used again in verse 32. This shows us Paul&rsquo;s inward condition. Within him there was a wish for something. He wished to see the Corinthians be the same as he was. By the time we come to verse 40, we find that this was actually the wish and desire of the Spirit of God. Paul&rsquo;s wish was God&rsquo;s wish. His desire was God&rsquo;s desire. Since this was the case, how careful Paul must have needed to be when he exercised his wish. If he wished wrongly, what would have happened? God&rsquo;s word would have been confused. Paul&rsquo;s wishing was a delicate feeling in his spirit. If he had made a mistake in his wishes and desires, what would have happened? God had full control over the delicate feelings of this man. This is the reason that when he wished for something, it was actually the Holy Spirit who was wishing.</p>
<p>Here was a man whose feelings were under God&rsquo;s hand. The Lord was able to put His trust in Paul&rsquo;s feelings. Brothers, can the Lord use our feelings? Can He trust us? We need to be broken. Without this, the Lord cannot trust our feelings. Paul&rsquo;s feelings were fully under God&rsquo;s hand; God could trust his feelings. They were dependable and accurate. In verse 12 Paul said, &ldquo;But to the rest I say, I, not the Lord.&rdquo; He did not have the clear registration that the Lord was speaking. He made it clear that he was speaking, not the Lord. In the end, however, he said that he had the Spirit of God. What a marvel that Paul could reach such a stage!</p>
<p>In verse 25 he clearly conveyed his feelings before the Lord. He said, &ldquo;Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.&rdquo; Here was a man who had been following the Lord for many years. The Lord had shown him mercy again and again. This mercy had made him faithful. He was a steward of God, a minister of Christ, a steward of the mysteries of God. What is required of a steward is faithfulness (4:1-2). What was Paul faithful to? He was faithful to his ministry. He was a steward of the mysteries of God, a minister of the word of Christ. God had entrusted mysteries to him; He had placed His word in his hands. The main requirement of a minister of the word is faithfulness. Since Paul had obtained mercy from the Lord to be a faithful minister, he could tell others of his opinions. He did not receive any commandment from the Lord, but he expressed his wish. He had received mercy to be a minister and to exercise stewardship over God&rsquo;s word. Yet God had not given him a commandment, and he would not dare say anything by himself. However, based on the numerous times that he had exercised stewardship over God&rsquo;s mysteries, and through the numerous times he had served as an oracle for God&rsquo;s word, he could tell others his opinion concerning certain matters. He had received mercy from God and had been in touch with spiritual things and had handled similar matters repeatedly in the past. He had learned some lessons before God and had picked up something little by little. In this instance he did not have a commandment from the Lord, yet he told the Corinthians something based on what he had seen and learned throughout the years. He dared not say that his word was the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. He only told them his opinion. Yet in the end, God acknowledged this opinion. God recognized Paul&rsquo;s opinion as being His own. What a glory! We have to praise the Lord for this! Here was a man who had obtained mercy to be faithful and whose opinion was fully acknowledged by the Lord.</p>
