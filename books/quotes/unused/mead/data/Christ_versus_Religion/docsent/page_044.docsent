   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this Book of Matthew, a book concerning Christ versus religion, it is indeed impressive and meaningful that the ascension of Jesus is never mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is not one verse or word in this book telling us that He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This book is a book of Emmanuel, God with us Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could He ascend to the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is with us!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is this book which also says, "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the completion of the age."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church needs a present Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We believe that the Lord is undoubtedly in the heavens Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But today, He as the resurrected and living Christ is continually in the church with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is so wonderfully and really present.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we come together we do have the sense that while we are meeting He is here.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need this realization in all our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not look to Him only as the ascended One, but as the present One.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Jesus is here!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever I hear people speaking about Easter and saying that they will have a sunrise service, I always remark that every day to me is Easter and all our meetings are sunrise meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Every meeting is a celebration of the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What day is it today?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If it is Tuesday, then it must be Easter Tuesday.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every day should be Easter to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every meeting, whether it is in the morning or in the evening, must be a sunrise meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should never have anything as a sunset, for we have the presence of the resurrected Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christians, especially in this country, are always asking where our headquarters are located.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I would tell them now that if we have any headquarters, they are on the mountain top of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our headquarters are with the resurrected Christ on the mountain top.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have nothing religious.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All we have is the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How much we all need to be delivered from the concept of religion!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How much we have been poisoned with religious concepts, and how many religious concepts there are still in our blood!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you will pray-read all these verses, bring all these points to the Lord and put them into practical application, you will see how much you still need the deliverance of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In conclusion what we have today is just the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His authority is our power, and His presence is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His presence is our regulation, His presence is our creed, His presence is our teaching and our preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as we have His presence, we need nothing more and we want nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Praise the Lord we have it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hallelujah!</S>
