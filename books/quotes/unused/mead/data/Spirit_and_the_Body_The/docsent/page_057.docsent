   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ATTRACTION TO THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Three things will attract people to the church: our daily walk, the rich meetings, and the proper communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe that these three things will bring in the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The increase should come in this way, rather than by the means of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, this does not mean that we should not preach; we must preach a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must have a daily walk that is uplifted; meetings that are high, living, and rich; and a communal life that is pure, yet full of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This will attract our relatives, friends, neighbors, and classmates into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I hope that all the churches with all the saints will devote their attention to these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>PRESENTING THE TRUTHS OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In addition to these matters, there is the need for us all to be trained to present the truths.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all must learn the things related to the Lord's recovery in such a way that we shall be able to present them to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, we must learn how to present what we are enjoying in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, many Christians do not know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some think a chapel, cathedral, or bungalow with a high tower is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On Sunday mornings many speak of going to church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Others refer to their church as the church on a particular street, indicating thereby that they do not know what the church really is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, we ourselves must know what the church is and then learn how to present to others the truth in a pleasant, convincing, and attractive manner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whenever we are asked anything, we must be ready to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First Peter 3:15 says that we must be "ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose someone asks you who the pastor of the church in Anaheim is, and you answer, "Every one of us is a pastor!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That would not be a proper answer; for it would cause others to think that you are not willing to talk to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even a simple question such as this is not easy to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to answer such a question properly, we must exercise both our spirit and our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to learn how to present things to people in a pleasant way, in a way that is convincing, subduing, and captivating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever people ask us a question, that is an opportunity to catch them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To do this, we must learn how to share with them in a complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If someone asks you what it means to turn to the spirit, that is an excellent opportunity to capture him by sharing something with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all must learn to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At present most of us are not strong in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, we need to speak convincingly when others ask us questions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Take every question as an opportunity to catch a fish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But this requires a great deal of training.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>About thirty years ago I spent much time in this kind of training in the church in my hometown, and it worked very well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Suppose someone asks you a difficult or nonsensical question.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not reply in an offensive manner.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, answer in a way that will calm down the other party.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the way to catch people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is possible to talk to people for hours without touching the thing about which they have inquired.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not be bothered if they ask nonsensical questions, but use the opportunity to inject something positive into them.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not let them go until they have received a good injection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some Christians may ask why our meetings are so loud.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not say, "We are all excited because Jesus is our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all eat Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eating Jesus is the way!"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some of our young people have answered in just this way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead of responding in this manner, answer in a way to soften the one who has asked the question.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As you talk with him, give him an injection.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whether he agrees or disagrees, the injection will get into him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our locality is our fishing pond, and every day we are surrounded by fish.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For this reason, I am burdened that all the churches train the saints to present what we are enjoying.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If, when you are asked a question, you always say, "I don't know," you are not useful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not an easy thing to say, "I don't know."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many of us cannot say these words, will not say them, or do not know how to say them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We must learn the right time to say, "I don't know."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then these words will be useful.</S>
