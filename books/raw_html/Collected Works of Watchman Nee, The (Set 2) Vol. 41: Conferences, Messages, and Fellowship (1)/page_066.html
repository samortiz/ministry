<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">A REPORT ON THE VARIOUS REGIONS<br />OF WORK IN CHINA</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: November 21, 1935, morning<br />Place: Chuenchow</h1><p>The co-workers throughout China have asked me to give a report of our work in every part of the country. Since we are co-workers together in our work in China, we should be concerned for the work of the whole country. Later, if we find others standing on similar ground in other countries, we can enlarge our hearts to the work of the whole world and be concerned for them as well. Today, however, we should at least be burdened for the work in China as a whole. Our work today is limited to the coastal regions and Manchuria. During the past one or two years, there was some extension into the inland regions. Before the Lord we only have the assurance to speak about the following regions. Our division into regions is similar to the practice of the apostles. At that time, Jerusalem was a center, and Antioch was also a center. There was the Jewish region and the Gentile region. Peter was responsible for the work among the Jews, whereas Paul was responsible for the work among the Gentiles. Although there is a division of regions, there still remains one fellowship.</p><p>We propose the following divisions:</p><p>(1) Peking and Tientsin region. There are meetings in both of these places, with the meeting in Peking being stronger. Brother Witness Lee and Sister Peace Wang are responsible for this region. The work in Manchuria is also taken up by Brother Witness and Sister Wang.</p><p>(2) Chefoo, Tsingtao, and Tsinan belong to one region. The brothers in Shantung will be responsible for this region. Brother Hsu Chung-jie can also be used in this region.</p><p>(3) South of Tsinan. This region has too few people, and we will drop it for now. Later, we may work in this region more aggressively.</p><p>(4) From Pu-Kow to Nanking, including northern Kiangsu. Brother Chi Yung-tung and four or five other brothers are taking responsibility for this area. This is a good region, and there are considerable prospects for active progress.</p><p>(5) South of Nanking, including Wusih, Chin-Chiang, and Soochow. Brother Philip Luan is responsible for this area. In Shanghai there is Brother Stephen Kaung, Sister Ruth Lee, and myself.</p><p>(6) The center of Chekiang province is in Hangchow. In the northern part of Chekiang we have Sister Miao, Brother David Hsu, and Brother Chang Kwang-rong taking responsibility for that region. In the southern part of Chekiang around P'ing-Yang and Tai-Shun the situation is also quite good.</p><p>(7) Southern Fukien is somewhat difficult. North and west Fukien is also difficult. You workers here are responsible for the work in southern Fukien. This is one region, stretching from Fu-Ching to the southern provincial border. There are some moves in Swatow, Chiu-Chow, Hong Kong, and Canton, but at present nothing much can be accomplished in these places. Some strong ones need to go to these places to strengthen the work there.</p><p>(8) The three provinces of Manchuria can be considered as one region. Presently, there are seven meetings, and there is a good prospect for more spreading of the work.</p><p>(9) Central China. There is not much work in this region. Chi-Kow, Wu-ch'ang, and Ch'ang-sha do not yet have the strength to spread out.</p><p>Today we hope to carry on the work in four directions. The first is the local work, which should be taken up by the local ones. The second is the literature work. Our publications should spread throughout the whole of China and lead the whole nation to the Lord. Today our publications match those of any other organization. Beginning next January, we will put out regular periodicals and print ten thousand copies of each issue. Other magazines are printing only a few thousand or a few hundred copies at a time. Third, we should spread our work into the inland regions. Every region should be like a government office or a missionary board and should send men to the inland regions, including such places as Sinkiang, Mongolia, and Tibet. Now one brother has gone to Szechuen. Fourth, we need to pay attention to the work of edifying the young people. This should be done locally. We cannot join the local churches together to make them one, but the workers must be joined together and work together. We should give the young people the necessary preparations and then send them out for the work.</p><p>In the future our work will be conducted along these four lines. Everyone has to be responsible before the Lord for his portion. Your responsibility here is southern Fukien. But your view and fellowship should be that of the whole country. You are here to further the gospel together with all the co-workers, and you are here to be the Lord's present-day testimony. What we should do today is preach the gospel, consecrate ourselves, and work as best as we can. Not only should we work by ourselves, but we should bring others into the same work as well.</p>
