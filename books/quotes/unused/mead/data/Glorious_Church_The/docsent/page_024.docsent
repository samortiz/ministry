   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was a type showing that Christ will receive only that which is out of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only those who come out from Christ can return to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only those who receive life from Him can be received by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are many people who feel that they should offer all that they are and all that they have for the Lord's use.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But God cannot accept anything which is offered from a human source.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God cannot take or use anything which comes out from man himself.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They think that everything will be fine as long as they offer themselves, their abilities, their talents, and all they have to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But we must remember that Christ will accept only that which comes out of Himself; He will not accept anything which comes out of man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may say, "Among the apostles, was there not a Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Was he not well educated?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Was he not a man of great intelligence?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But we must remember the words that Paul spoke about himself.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We thank God that intelligent and eloquent men can come into the church, but their natural, original intelligence and their natural, original eloquence are of no spiritual use in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the church only one thing is recognized that which comes out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only that which is out of Christ can return to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The material for the building of such a bride is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The matter we need to attend to is this: only that which is out of Christ can be of any value and spiritual use in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God never uses the old creation to construct the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither does God use that which is of man to construct that which is of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He can never, never use fleshly things to produce something spiritual.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Would it be possible for that which is born of the flesh to become spirit?</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"That which is born of the flesh is flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All problems issue from the matter of source.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we want to know whether the result will be spiritual, we need only ask whether the source is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot use anything of the flesh to produce something of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A message which issues from thoughts only produces thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Work done by stirring up the emotion only produces emotional stimulation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Only work from the spirit produces the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The question is not whether the goal or the purpose is right, but what the process is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Man considers that as long as the goal is right, everything else is right.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But God not only asks if the goal is right, He also asks how we do it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Someone may say, "I am for the Lord, and the work I am doing is for the church the work of saving souls, spiritual work, the work of extending the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I have given all my ability and intelligence to it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Isn't this good?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In spite of this, man's natural ability and intelligence that which has not been dealt with by the cross are of no spiritual use.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord said, "That which is born of the flesh is flesh" v. 6a .</S>
