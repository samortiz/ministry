   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ETERNAL LIFE AND THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is one thing we have to be clear about.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To have eternal life is different from entering the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whoever cannot see the difference between eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens will never be clear concerning the way of salvation and the way of preservation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord Jesus said that from John the Baptist until now the kingdom of the heavens is taken by violence Matt 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The violent take it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The law and the prophecies of the prophets ended with John 11:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Based on this word, some have said that we must be violent, that is, we must strive before we can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we do not strive, we will not be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A person says this because he cannot tell the difference between the kingdom of the heavens and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is a difference between eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first difference between eternal life and the kingdom lies in time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Eternal life is for eternity, but the kingdom is not for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the new heaven and the new earth come, the kingdom of the heavens will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The kingdom of the heavens denotes God's rule.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The period of God's rule is the period of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's sovereignty on earth and His rule on earth will be manifested for only one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What are the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The book of Daniel talks about the ruling of the heavens 7:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, the kingdom of the heavens is the sphere in which the heavens rule.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord Jesus comes to rule on earth, that will be the time when the heavens rule.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today the ruling one on earth is the devil, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The worldly politics and authorities today are of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus will not rule until the time of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the period during which the authority of the heavens is realized is very short.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 15:24 says, "Then the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to His God and Father, once He has abolished all rule and all authority and power."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The kingdom will be delivered up to God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, there is a time limit to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But eternal life is forever.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everyone who reads 1 Corinthians 15 knows that at the beginning of the new heaven and the new earth, that is, at the conclusion of the millennium, the kingdom will be delivered up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, there is a difference in time between eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second difference lies in the method that man enters the kingdom of the heavens and the way he obtains eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The receiving of eternal life is the subject of the entire Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The way to have eternal life is by believing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once we believe, we obtain.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We never read of another way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The entire Gospel of Matthew mentions the kingdom of the heavens thirty-two times.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not once does it say that the kingdom of the heavens is received by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How does a man gain the kingdom of the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Matthew 7:21 says, "Not every one who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One can see that the entry into the kingdom of the heavens is a question of work rather than of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Matthew 5:3 also tells us, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Here it does not say eternal life but the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To have the kingdom of the heavens, one needs to be poor in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord also says, "Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens" v. 10 . One does not have to be persecuted to receive eternal life, but the kingdom is for those who have been persecuted for the sake of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even if a man has eternal life, if he has not been persecuted for the sake of righteousness today and is not poor in spirit, he may still have no share in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is a third difference.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It lies in the attitude Christians should have concerning eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Concerning eternal life, God has never told us to seek after it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, every time it is mentioned, He shows us that we have it already.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, concerning the kingdom, the word of the Bible says that we have to seek after it and pursue it diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today, concerning the kingdom, we are in the stage of pursuit; we have not obtained it yet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We still have to put forth the effort to seek and pursue after the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The fourth difference lies in the way God treats the kingdom and eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God treats eternal life as a gift; it is given to us Rom 6:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One never sees a person going to the Lord to seek for eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is not such a thing, because eternal life is free grace; it is given through the Lord Jesus to all those who believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There is no difference between a seeking one and one who is not seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But the kingdom is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>One recalls the mother of the two sons of Zebedee coming to the Lord Jesus and wishing that the Lord would cause her two sons to sit on both sides of Him in the kingdom Matt 20:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But the Lord Jesus said, "To sit on My right and on My left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father" v. 23 . Grace is obtained once we call on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the kingdom depends on whether one can be baptized in His baptism and drink the cup which He drank.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Both of the disciples said that they could.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But the Lord said that even though they promised that they would and could, the matter is still not up to Him to decide.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Father is the One who gives.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, the criminal who was crucified along with the Lord said to Him, "Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom" Luke 23:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Did the Lord Jesus hear his prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Indeed, He did.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>But He did not grant his request.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The criminal asked the Lord to remember him when the Lord receives the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord Jesus did not answer him that he would be with Him in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Rather, He answered him, "Today you shall be with Me in Paradise" v. 43 . The Lord did not answer his question concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But He did give him a reply concerning Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As long as we call on Him, we can go to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But it is not so simple to go into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Hence, there is a big difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's attitude toward eternal life and the kingdom of the heavens is different: one is the gift of God, and the other is the reward of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Concerning the difference between the kingdom of the heavens and eternal life, there are other passages in the Bible which are quite interesting.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now we come to the fifth difference.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Revelation 20 shows us that the martyrs receive the kingdom, although it does not say that they are the only ones who receive the kingdom v. 4 . The Bible, however, never shows us that man must be martyred to receive eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If that were the case, Christianity would become a religion of death, for then man must die.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But one does not see such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>However, the kingdom is different.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The kingdom requires striving.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>It even takes martyrdom to obtain the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For example, poverty is a necessary condition for the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In order to obtain the kingdom of the heavens, one has to lose his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Bible shows us clearly that no person on earth who is rich according to his own ways can enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We cannot say that no rich man can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We cannot say that no one can enter into eternal life who would not lose his riches.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Inasmuch as it is difficult for the camel to go through the eye of the needle, in the same way it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens Matt 19:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>But have you heard that inasmuch as it is impossible for the camel to go through the eye of the needle, in the same way it is impossible for a rich man to be saved and have eternal life?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The poor can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>So can the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The poor can inherit eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>So can the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>But to enter into the kingdom of the heavens is a problem for the rich.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we accumulate wealth on earth, we will not be able to enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Of course, this does not mean that one has to give up all of his money today.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>I am saying that one has to hand over all his money to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We are only the stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We are not the master of the house.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The Bible never recognizes a Christian as the master of his money.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Everyone is but a steward of money that is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>All of us are but the Lord's stewards.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>There is such a condition for entering the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>There is another very peculiar thing.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>One never sees the questions of marriage and family come into play involving the matter of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>But the Gospel of Matthew says that some will not marry for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Some even made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of the heavens Matt 19:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In order to enter into the kingdom of the heavens, and in order to gain a place in the kingdom, they choose to remain virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>One does not see a married person being denied eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If such were the case, Peter would have been the first one to have a problem, for he had a mother-in-law Matt 8:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We see that the question of eternal life is not related to family and marriage at all, but the question of the kingdom is very much related to the family and marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is why the Bible says that those who have wives should be like those who had none.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Those who use the world should be as those not using it, and those who buy should be as those who do not possess 1 Cor 7:29-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This has much to do with our position in the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Finally, we have to mention another difference.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>In the kingdom, there are different levels of rank.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Even if men are able to enter into the kingdom, there is a difference in the position that they hold there.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Some will receive ten cities, and others will receive five Luke 19:17-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Some will merely receive reward, but others will receive great reward.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Some will gain a rich entrance into the kingdom 2 Pet 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Some will enter the kingdom without a rich entrance.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Hence, there is a difference in rank in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>But there is never a question of rank regarding eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Eternal life is the same for everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>One will not receive ten years more than another.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>There is no difference in eternal life, but there is a difference in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>If one would consider a little, he will realize that in the Bible, the kingdom and eternal life are two absolutely different things.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>The condition for salvation is faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Other than faith, there is no other condition, for all the conditions have been met by the Son of God already.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>His Son's death has met all of God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>But to enter the kingdom of the heavens is another matter; it requires works.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Today a man is saved by God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>But we cannot enter the kingdom of the heavens unless our righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and the Pharisees Matt 5:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>The righteousness in one's living and conduct must surpass that of the scribes and the Pharisees before he can enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Hence, one sees that the question of eternal life is completely based on the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>But the question of the kingdom is based on man's works.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>I am not saying that the kingdom is better than eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>But God has a place for both.</S>
