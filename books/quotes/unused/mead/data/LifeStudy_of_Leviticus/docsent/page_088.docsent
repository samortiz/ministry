   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Signifying That the Partakers of Christ Should Be God's Serving Ones Priests</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The males among the sons of Aaron eating of the meal offering also signifies that the partakers of Christ should be God's serving ones priests.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do our daily work without serving God as a priest, we cannot share in the real enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In such a case, we may think that we have this enjoyment, but our thought does not correspond to the actual situation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>THE MEAL OFFERING OF AARON AND HIS SONS ON THE DAY WHEN AARON IS ANOINTED</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"This is the offering of Aaron and his sons which they shall offer to Jehovah on the day when he is anointed" v. 20a . This signifies that the enjoyment of Christ as the life supply is related to the priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Again and again I would emphasize the fact that the enjoyment of Christ as the meal offering is related to our priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A. The Tenth of an Ephah of Fine Flour as a Continual Meal Offering</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 20b speaks of "the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a continual meal offering."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This signifies that the top portion, the tenth part, of the enjoyment of Christ should be for God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This also signifies that this kind of enjoyment of Christ should continue in our priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Half of the Meal Offering in the Morning and Half in the Evening to Keep It a Continual Offering</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Half of the meal offering was offered in the morning and half in the evening to keep it a continual offering v. 20c . This signifies the continual enjoyment of Christ in the priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The meal offering is only for the priests, and it is prevailing only in the priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be priests, but our priestly service may not be prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If this is our situation, then the priestly food will likewise not be prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This spiritual food can be prevailing only in a prevailing priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must be serving priests in actuality.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then the priestly food will actually be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. The Meal Offering Being Entirely Burned and Not Eaten by the Priest</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>"It is a perpetual statute; it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every meal offering of a priest shall be entirely burned; it must not be eaten" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>22b-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This signifies that the enjoyment of Christ for God's satisfaction should be absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our enjoyment of Christ is measured by the extent to which we are actually priests serving God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our feeling is not the measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are priests, but if there is a problem with our priestly service, there will also be a problem with the enjoyment of Christ as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In doing anything, we need to be in the right position.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we are not in the right position, then we cannot have anything to do with that particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although we are priests, in a practical way we may be in the wrong position and therefore cannot have the real enjoyment of Christ as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My loving intention in speaking this word is to encourage you to reconsider your way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not think that you are all right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can testify to you that daily I need to reconsider my way and my situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is a serious matter because none of us knows when the Lord might take him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may be taken at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once the Lord takes us away, it will be too late for us to do anything about our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have been clearly told that at His coming the Lord will set up a judgment seat Rom 14:10; 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We all will stand there and give an account to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In particular, we will have to confess all the words that came out of our mouth while we were on earth Matt 12:36-37 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, we need to be careful in what we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>My desire is not to be an expositor of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My burden is to minister the Lord's word in a living and enlightening way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I would like all the dear saints to be enlightened and to see some light concerning themselves, concerning the church, and concerning God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is crucial that we be brought into the light and that the light shine upon us, around us, and within us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to remember that the first three offerings the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering bring us into the light.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the light we are enlightened to see our sin and our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whether we are old or young, whether we have been saved for many years or for a few months, we need to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all need to be brought into the divine light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We thank the Lord that we are children of light Eph 5:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since we are children of light, we must be in the light to be clear first concerning ourselves and then concerning God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is what I am expecting to see.</S>
