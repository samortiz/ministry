It is not a question of whether or not there is water in the container but whether there are holes. Some brothers and sisters greatly desire to know about the cross and, at times, are very willing to bear the cross. Such ones should be full of life. Yet it is strange that even though they are so seeking, desirous, and willing to bear the cross, they do not touch any life in them. Instead, they touch death, because all the life that they have gained has leaked away.</p><p>Proverbs 13:3 says, "He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life:/but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction."</p><p>We are not sure whether Solomon was referring to physical life or spiritual life when he wrote this proverb. But let us consider spiritual things based on this principle. A seeker of the Lord, who has life and wishes to supply the church with life, must be careful with his words. If we are not careful with our words, life will leak away. Why are some people not very useful in the hand of the Lord? They are not useful because life has leaked away. One only touches death in them; one does not touch any life in them because the life has leaked away through their words. Therefore, we have to guard our mouth, even keeping a close watch on it. Many stories testify that nothing leaks away life as much as idle words. This does not mean that sin is better than idle words. However, it does mean that next to sin the most debilitating thing for our life is our idle words.</p><p>Matthew 12:36 says, "And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment."</p><p>Does it say "every filthy word"? No. Does it say "every blasphemous word"? No. Does it say "every evil word"? No. It says "every idle word." Idle words are redundant words, incongruous words, unnecessary words, and gossiping words. "Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned." This is what the Lord Jesus said. We have to realize that not only are blasphemous words serious but loose words are also serious. It is a serious thing to speak idle words as well as filthy words. We have to realize that we can make recompense for certain sins, but we cannot make recompense for other things and sins. If we offend anyone through idle words, there is no way to make a recompense for this. We can confess to others, and we can retract our words, but the sound has reached others' ears, and we cannot take it back. It is possible to make a recompense if we have stolen from others. But it is impossible to make a recompense if we have offended others with idle words. This sin will have to go before the Lord. Therefore, the Lord said, "Every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment. For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned."</p><p>Proverbs 15:4 says, "A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: /but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit."</p><p>To be wholesome is to be temperate, mild, and moderate. When a man speaks too much, his tongue becomes hot, and when his tongue is hot, the tree of life is gone. A wholesome tongue is a tree of life. A wholesome tongue is a tongue that is not quick, foolish, or excessive. Such a tongue is like a tree of life. One cannot smell the flavor of Christ in a Christian who loves idle words. Those who love idle words cannot supply life to others. Idle words are a big hole which leak away one's life.</p><p>Idle words leak away life. What then should we do? In order to keep our mouth, we must first deal with our heart. The Lord says, "For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matt. 12:34). When the heart has something, the mouth speaks it out. If we have something in our heart, sooner or later, it will come out of our mouth. If we do not speak it here, we will speak it elsewhere. If we do not speak it in this house, we will speak it in another house. Whatever is in the heart, the mouth will speak out. Therefore, in order to learn before the Lord to stop our idle words, we must start by dealing with our heart. If we do not deal with our heart, our mouth can never be dealt with properly. It is the heart that is first filled with all kinds of things before the mouth speaks of them. Never think that a word can be said in a heartless way. The Lord's Word shows us that there is not such a thing. As long as there is a word, there is a heart for it. Because there is a heart for something, the mouth speaks. Hence, in order to deal with idle words, we must first deal with the heart.</p><p>Paul exhorted the Corinthian brothers who were in trouble to "all speak the same thing." How can this be? He continued by saying, "That you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion" (1 Cor. 1:10). The life of the church is like the life of an individual. The life of an individual can leak away through idle words. The life of the church can also leak away through idle words. Because we have the same life, we should be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion. Once we are attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion, we can speak the same thing, and we will not have idle words. Therefore, to deal with idle words, we must first deal with the heart.</p><p>James 3:11 says, "Does the spring, out of the same opening, gush forth the sweet and the bitter?" If a spring cannot gush forth two kinds of water, a mouth cannot speak two kinds of words. A spring can only gush forth one kind of water. In the same way a mouth can only speak one kind of word. We must deal with idle words before the Lord in a definite way. If this leakage is not stopped, undesirable things will keep pouring in, and things that should not leak away will continue to leak away. The loss will be immeasurable. We have to stop this leakage at any cost. We need to ask the Lord, saying, "Lord, deal with my mouth so that I can be preserved by Your grace."</p><p>You must deal not only with your own mouth but also with others' mouths. You have to help those who love idle words, gossip, and idle reports. Some people like to come to you with idle words. You should not allow them to start. You can say to them, "Brother, let us pray." You should not allow them to speak idle words. You should lead them to pray or recite Scripture verses. You should lead them to the proper path. You can even be more blunt by saying, "Brother, we have to learn to speak words that edify others. It is better that we do not speak any idle words."</p><p>If we want to be one who stops the leakage, we must first ask God to deliver us from our curiosity. We should learn to fear God. Many Christians are curious; they like to hear novel things and even filthy things. Their ears are like a garbage can which takes in all kinds of things. If we are delivered from this, we will save ourselves from many sins and help many brothers and sisters from many sins. If our ears are not itching and if we do not afford others the opportunity to speak idle words, we will preserve our mouth from leaking life and help others to stop their leakage.</p><p>May the Lord deliver us from idle words that leak life. Other than sin, idle words leak life the most. If we are preserved in our words, we will be able to preserve life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
