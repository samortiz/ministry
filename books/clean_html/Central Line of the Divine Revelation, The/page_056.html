<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Live Him as the Pneumatic Christ<br>by the Bountiful Supply of His Spirit</H2><P>Third, we must live Him as the pneumatic Christ by the bountiful supply of His Spirit (Phil. 1:19b-21a). The pneumatic Christ has a supply&#151;the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ has the bountiful supply to support us so that we can live the pneumatic Christ, who is not in the flesh but in the spirit, in the pneuma.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. To Be Filled with the Spirit<br>Within and Without and to Walk according<br>to the Spirit in Our Spirit</H2><P>Fourth, we must be filled with the Spirit within and without, and we must live and walk according to the Spirit in our spirit (Acts 13:52; 4:31b; Gal. 5:16, 25; Rom. 8:4b). To be filled with the Spirit within and without is to be filled inwardly and outwardly. To be filled inwardly is to have the infilling of the Spirit, and to be filled outwardly is to experience the outpouring of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. To Overcome Individualism,<br>Sectarianism, and Christianity, and<br>to Live the Life of the Body of Christ</H2><P>Fifth, we must overcome individualism, sectarianism, and Christianity, and we must live the life of the Body of Christ (Rev. 2:26-27; 3:21). We must overcome every kind of "anity" and "ism," including Christianity and "church-anity." We must also learn to live the life of the Body of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. To Receive God's Constant and<br>Instant Dispensing Continuously through<br>Unceasing Prayer, Not Quenching the Spirit</H2><P>Sixth, we must receive God's constant and instant dispensing continuously through unceasing prayer, not quenching the Spirit (1 Thes. 5:17, 19). When we become such persons, we will overcome Satan, sin, and death, we will experience the termination of the old man, and we will participate in the all-embracing blessing of the Spirit of Christ and in the kingship of Christ. This is our experience through the daily, moment by moment, dispensing of the Triune God.</P>
