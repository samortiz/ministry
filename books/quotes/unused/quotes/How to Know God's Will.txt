When the Lord draws men to Himself, He draws some through their mind, others through their emotion, and still others through their will
Those who only have a mental understanding of doctrines are not necessarily those who live a proper Christian life
Wherever they go they carry an air of excitement, but when their zeal fades away, even ten persons could not move them an inch
They can cry with others or laugh with others, but when the tide of excitement subsides, they cannot bring anyone to the Lord
Suppose a man has a clear mind before the Lord, a proper emotion, good knowledge of the Bible, and zealousness in serving others
All of these things are wonderful, but if he has never been touched by the Lord, he cannot serve God in a proper way
Every Christian has received the same life from God in his spirit; there is no difference between him and others
Since the inner new man can only be expressed through the outer man, the expressions and manifestations are different in different persons
In order for a saved and regenerated believer to live out the Lord's life, there are two steps that he has to take
The second is consecrating himself, which means committing his outer man to the Lord to allow the new life within to be expressed
If a man is willing to consecrate his mind, emotion, and will to the Lord in an absolute way, he will live out the Lord's life
Of course, they are better than the ones without emotion, but they are so unstable that they are like the waves of the ocean
It does not matter much if a person knows God's will; it is more important that a person be willing to choose God's will
You may have the right methods, and you may act faithfully according to these methods step by step, but you will still not know God's will'
In Genesis 18 when God was about to destroy the city of Sodom, He came to Abraham because He could not hide this matter from him
He was not a slave of God, because a slave does not know the mind of the master; only a friend knows the mind of a friend
Lot was Abraham's relative; he might have had a great deal of spiritual knowledge, but God did not speak with Lot
On the subject of knowing God's will, Paul said that we should not be foolish, but should understand what the will of the Lord is
You do not have to be concerned for what God's will is; you only have to consecrate yourself honestly to Him to do His will
The seven Spirits in Revelation are sent forth into all the earth, but they do not have anything to do with the earth
If you have any stubbornness jealousy pride or petty problems of a similar nature you will be spiritually sick and unable to know Gods will
If you want to stop your ear from hearing anything, there is no need to plug it with a rod or a desk; all you need is a little finger
When you seek after God's will again and again and are still unclear, you should not change the method, but change the person
All we have to do is consecrate ourselves to the Lord, deal with all the hindrances, and maintain a proper relationship with Him
Even though the earth, the solar system, and the universe are vast and immense, they can never be compared with the will of God!
Those who do not know God's will are not even qualified to be called a Christian; they are wasting His provisions
It is possible for an unbeliever to be ignorant of God's will, but it is inexcusable for us to be ignorant of His will
A Christian must first be a friend of Christ one who knows His will, before he can be a slave of Christ one who serves Him
