   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we want to differentiate clearly between sin and sins, there is one portion of the Scriptures which we must consider.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is the first eight chapters of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These eight chapters show us the full significance of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these eight chapters we find one outstanding feature: from chapter one through 5:11, only the word sins is mentioned; sin is never mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But from 5:12 until the end of chapter eight, what we find is sin, not sins.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From chapter one through 5:11, Romans shows us that man has committed sins before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From 5:12 on, Romans shows us what kind of person man is before God: he is a sinner before God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sin refers to the life that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Prior to Romans 5:12, there is no mention of the dead being made alive, for the problem there is not that one needs to be made alive, but that the individual sins that one has committed need to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From 5:12 on, we have the second section.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we see something strong and powerful within us as a law in our members, which is sin, that compels and drags us to commit sinful acts, that is, sins.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this, there is the need of being freed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Sins have to do with our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the Bible shows us that for our sins we need forgiveness Matt 26:28; Acts 2:38; 10:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But sin is that which entices and compels us to commit sinful acts.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, the Bible shows us that we need to be freed from sin Rom 6:18, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once I met a missionary who talked about "the forgiveness of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Right away I stood up and grasped his hand and asked, "Where in the Bible does it say 'the forgiveness of sin'?"</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He contended that there are many such cases.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I asked if he could find one for me, he said, "What do you mean?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can you not find even one place that says this?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told him that nowhere in the entire Bible are the words the forgiveness of sin mentioned; instead, the Bible always speaks of "the forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is the sins that are forgiven, not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He did not believe my words, so he went to look this up in his Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually he told me, "Mr. Nee, it is so strange.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every time this phrase is used, a little s is added in."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I believe that you can see that it is the sins that are forgiven, not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sins are outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That is why they need to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But something else is inside of us, something strong and powerful that compels us to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For this we do not need forgiveness; for this our one need is to be freed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As soon as we are no longer under its power and have nothing to do with it, we will be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The solution to sins comes from forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The solution to sin, however, comes when we are no longer under its power and have nothing to do with it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sins are a matter of our actions and are committed one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That is why they need to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But sin is within us, and we need to be freed from it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the Bible never says "forgiveness of sin" but "forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Neither does the Bible speak about being "freed from sins."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I can assure you that the Bible never says this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Instead the Bible says that we are "freed from sin," rather than from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The only thing that we need to escape and be freed from is that which entices us and compels us to commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This distinction is clearly made in the Bible.</S>
