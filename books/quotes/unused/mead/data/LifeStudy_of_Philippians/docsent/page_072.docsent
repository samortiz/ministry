   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CITIZENSHIP IN THE HEAVENS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 20 Paul goes on to say, For our citizenship is in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word rendered citizenship may also be rendered commonwealth or associations of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our national life is not in any earthly country; it is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our real citizenship, our true commonwealth, is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes as I am traveling, people ask me where I come from.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although I may have to tell them that I come from China, I prefer to say that I come from the heavens and that my citizenship is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because our citizenship is in the heavens, we should not be occupied with earthly things, with the physical things needed for our existence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not place such a high value on material things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This does not mean, of course, that we should not have proper food, clothing, housing, and transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We definitely need these things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But anything that goes beyond need falls into the category of indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Such indulgence is to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we love the earthly things needed for human life, this is an indication that we do not treasure our heavenly citizenship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>May we all remember that our citizenship is in the heavens and that we are a heavenly people sojourning on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have food, clothing, housing, and transportation to maintain life, we should be content.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us not indulge ourselves in any earthly, material things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the heavens we are eagerly awaiting a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory, according to the operation of Him who is able even to subject all things to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The transfiguration of our body will be the ultimate consummation of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His salvation God first regenerated our spirit John 3:6 , now He is transforming our soul Rom 12:2 , and, consummately, He will transfigure our body, making us the same as Christ in all three parts of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In verse 21 Paul refers to our body as the body of our humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This describes our natural body, made of worthless dust Gen 2:7 and damaged by sin, weakness, sickness, and death Rom 6:6; 7:24; 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But one day this body will be transfigured and conformed to the body of Christ s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ s body of glory is His resurrected body, saturated with God s glory Luke 24:26 and transcendent over corruption and death Rom 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No matter how we may feed and clothe our body and no matter what kind of automobile we use to transport it or dwelling place to house it, it is still a body of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You may allow your body to rest on the best and most expensive bed, but it is nonetheless a body of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, we should not hate or despise our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we despise our body, we shall practice asceticism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a very real sense, we should love our body for the Lord s sake.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to care for the body without allowing it to indulge itself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day, the Lord Jesus will come and transfigure the body of humiliation and conform it to the body of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 21 Paul says that the transfiguration of the body of humiliation is according to the operation of Him who is able even to subject all things to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The transfiguration of our body is by the great power which subjects all things to the Lord Eph 1:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the almighty power in the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe that now we can grasp Paul s basic thought in Philippians 3.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this chapter Paul instructs us both concerning how to deal with the soul and how to deal with the body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To deal with the soul, we must count as loss all religious, philosophical, and cultural things so that Christ may occupy our entire being and that we may gain Him to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To deal with our body, we should take care of our physical need, but not indulge in excessive physical enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our aim should be to care for the body in a proper way that it may be healthy for the Lord s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But our intention should not be to glorify the physical body through the overenjoyment of physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Our body is not to be glorified in this way, but is to be glorified at the time of the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time, He will transfigure our body of humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, we are waiting for Christ to come back that we may be brought into the ultimate consummation of God s salvation the transfiguration of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>While we are waiting for the Lord s coming, we should take care of our physical needs without indulging in material things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the same time, we should deal with our soul, counting as loss all religious, philosophical, and cultural things so that our soul may be transformed in full.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Day by day, we are undergoing the process of transformation in our soul as we are waiting for the Lord to come to transfigure our body and thereby to bring us into the ultimate consummation of God s salvation.</S>
