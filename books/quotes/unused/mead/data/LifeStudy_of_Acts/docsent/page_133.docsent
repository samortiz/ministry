   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO SYRIA AND CILICIA</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 15:40 and 41 say, But Paul, having chosen Silas, went out, being commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, establishing the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was the start of Paul s second ministry journey, which ended in 18:22.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The fact that Paul was commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers indicates that he, and not Barnabas, had taken the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>TO DERBE AND LYSTRA Circumcising Timothy</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 16:1-5 we see that Paul came to Derbe and Lystra.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And behold, a certain disciple was there named Timothy, a son of a believing Jewish woman, but of a Greek father, who was well attested by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul wanted this one to go forth with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1b-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul s circumcising Timothy because of the Jews indicates the strong influence of the Judaic background that still remained among the Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This disturbed and frustrated the move of the Lord s gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In chapter fifteen of Acts the solution to the problem regarding circumcision was put in writing 15:20, 23-30 , and Paul carried this letter with him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Acts 16:4 indicates this: Now as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why, then, did Paul circumcise Timothy?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Considering Timothy good material for the work, Paul wanted him to go forth with him 16:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are told that Paul took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In circumcising Timothy Paul may have been exercising his wisdom to make the situation easier for him to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise there was no reason for Paul to have Timothy circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Circumcision of Timothy</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Considered in the Light of the Book of Galatians</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We need to consider Paul s circumcising of Timothy in Acts 16 in the light of what Paul says concerning circumcision in the book of Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Galatians 2:1-3 say, Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the gospel which I proclaim among the nations, but privately to those of reputation, lest somehow I should be running or had run in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These verses refer to what is recorded in Acts 15.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Acts 15 there is no mention of Titus, but in Galatians 2 Paul tells us that he took Titus with him to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, Paul says that Titus was not compelled to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since Titus in Galatians 2 was not circumcised, why did Paul in Acts 16 circumcise Timothy when he was on his second ministry journey?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Here we see that Paul acted in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>On the one hand, Titus was not circumcised; on the other hand, Paul had Timothy circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Galatians 5:2 says, Behold, I Paul say to you that if you are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How does this word apply to the circumcision of Timothy?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since Timothy was circumcised, did Christ profit him nothing?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Galatians 5:4 Paul goes on to say, You have been brought to naught from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a serious word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be brought to naught from Christ is to be reduced to nothing from Christ, deprived of all profit from Christ and so separated from Him, making Him void of effect.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Galatians 6:14 Paul says, But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this verse the world is not the world in general but the Jewish, religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As the following verse indicates, here Paul is saying that the religious world has been crucified to him, and he to the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Galatians 6:15 he goes on to explain, For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As we have pointed out elsewhere, circumcision is an ordinance of the law, whereas the new creation is of the divine life with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul also speaks of circumcision in Galatians 5:6: For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith operating through love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here the word avails indicates force or practical power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Circumcision is merely an outward ordinance and has no power or life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How can we reconcile Paul s having Timothy circumcised with what he says regarding circumcision in the book of Galatians?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When he wrote Galatians, his attitude towards circumcision was altogether negative.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In that Epistle he tells us that if we are circumcised Christ will profit us nothing, and that in Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since this was Paul s attitude toward circumcision, why did he have Timothy circumcised?</S>
