   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-SEVEN HOW TO DISTRIBUTE TRACTS THE IMPORTANCE OF DISTRIBUTING TRACTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Today we will consider the matter of distributing tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we have to know the importance of distributing tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>During the past two or three hundred years, God has used tracts very much to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whether they have been distributed by mail or by hand, tracts have played a very crucial role.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In China the practice of tract distribution still is not being carried out properly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In other countries many people have been saved through tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in China many people are still not too clear about the matter of tract distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some realize the importance of this work, but the tracts they use are short of "hooks"; they are not effective.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We hope that tract distribution would become a common practice in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We have to prepare some effective tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to charge the new ones with this work so that tract distribution will become a lesson and a training for everyone in the next generation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE BENEFITS OF DISTRIBUTING TRACTS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God has used tracts very much to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is something special about tract distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can enumerate the following benefits:</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Tracts Not Being Limited by Man's Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first advantage of distributing tracts is that they are not limited by man's ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many people cannot speak well.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They do not have the eloquence or the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Others are naturally shy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, even if a person is slow or shy, he has to open his mouth to testify for the Lord as soon as he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He cannot remain silent just because he says he is not eloquent.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The church should encourage the believers and should provide them many opportunities to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have to learn to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even those who do not have the gift of speaking should speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Having said this, the truth is that speaking is still a hard task for some people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Either they are short of truth or they are short in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some sinners need to be told the vanity of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some need to be told of how the evil and power of sin robs a person of all peace.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some people need to be told about repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many people do not know what to say when faced with such needs.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At these times they can pass out tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a person finds it hard to open his mouth to preach the gospel, tracts become an important tool.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A tract distributor must first know about the persons to whom he is giving the tracts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the receivers are his relatives or friends, he will understand their needs and be able to find the right tract to give to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If, in addition to the tract, he presents his own testimony, he will have a very good presentation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In preaching, it is easy to be affected and restricted by one's own condition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But tract distribution is independent of a man's own personal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In fact, many times the tracts speak more clearly and accurately than a man can speak.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the first advantage of tract distribution.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It makes up for a person's lack.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Tracts Not Being Limited by Age and Status</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second advantage of tracts is that they are not limited by the age or status of the receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>One basic principle in leading men to Christ is for workers to work on the same kind of person as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is unsuitable for a child to work on an old man or for a manual laborer to work on a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One should send an old man to work on an old man, a young man to work on a young man, and a nurse to work on a nurse.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Under normal circumstances, one should work within the sphere of his own social rank, sex, and age.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, it is better, and indeed more appropriate, for sisters to work on ladies.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Of course, there are exceptions to this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am a man, and it would be harder for me to preach to a young lady one-on-one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is equally embarrassing for a young sister to testify to an old man.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, with enough power one can sometimes overcome such barriers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But under normal circumstances, it is difficult to preach to people of different social standing, status, or background.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At such times, tracts come in very handy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When you visit a person, you must first pray earnestly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After that you can present a tract to him politely and testify to him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Perhaps you are a new believer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You do not know how or what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You only need to give him a tract.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This does not mean that you let the tract do all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The tract only makes up for your lack; you still have to open your mouth to testify.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When there is a gap between the preacher and his listener in rank, age, or sex, and there is some hesitation because of this gap, tracts fill the gap nicely.</S>
