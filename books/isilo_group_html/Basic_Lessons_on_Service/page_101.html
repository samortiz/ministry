THE NATURAL STRENGTH AND ABILITY<br>BECOMING USEFUL IN RESURRECTION<br>FOR OUR SERVICE TO THE LORD</H2><P>The natural strength and ability are useful if they are dealt with by the cross. After being dealt with by the cross, they are in resurrection. Some brothers speak in their natural eloquence, but other brothers speak with an eloquence dealt with by the cross. This is the eloquence in resurrection. Some who are short of experience may ask what the difference is between the natural eloquence and the eloquence in resurrection. It is hard to explain, but if you have the experience, it is easy to discern. Only those with the experience can discern the difference between the undealt with, natural strength and ability and the strength and ability in resurrection through the dealing of the cross.</P><P>In resurrection something divine has been wrought into our strength and ability. Even some divine element has been wrought into our eloquence. When we speak, we need to have our eloquence dealt with by the cross. The cross always works the divine element into the person it deals with, bringing God into him. If you have never been dealt with by the cross in your eloquence, that is the natural eloquence with nothing divine. But if your eloquence has been dealt with, that kind of eloquence is in resurrection and is full of the divine element. In the natural eloquence, there is no God. But the "dealt with" eloquence in resurrection is full of God. After being dealt with, our strength and ability become useful in resurrection for our service to the Lord.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE CASE OF MOSES</H2><P>We surely need to gain ability, but once we have the ability, we need to be dealt with. This was exactly what happened to Moses. The case of Moses is the best one to illustrate the matter of rejecting the natural strength and ability. No other person in the Bible is as good as Moses in this aspect.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Educated in All the Wisdom of the Egyptians and Being Powerful in Words and in Works</H2><P>Acts 7:22 tells us that Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in words and in works. He came out to work for God, to rescue God's people from the tyranny of Pharaoh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Doing Something for God's People<br>according to His Own Will</H2><P>Moses did something for God's people according to his own will (Acts 7:23-26). He was full of assurance that he could accomplish something, but he was carrying out his will, not God's will.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_100.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_102.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Service &nbsp; pg 101</div><br></body></html>
