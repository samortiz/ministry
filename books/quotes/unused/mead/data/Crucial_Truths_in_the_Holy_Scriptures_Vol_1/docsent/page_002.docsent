   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE CONDITION OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEED OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter we will consider the condition of man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Man s condition shows that he needs salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, we must use the Bible to show man his condition so that he may realize his need for God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are at least three aspects of the condition of fallen man prior to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>MAN S CONDITION BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All have sinned Rom 3:23, see also vv.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>10-12; 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first aspect of man s condition before God is that he has sinned and is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man s sinfulness before God is twofold; it is both positional and experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although a man may not have committed a sin, he is positionally sinful before God because he is a descendant of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Adam was appointed by God to be the head of the human race, and as such, he represents the entire human race.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When Adam sinned as head and representative of the human race, all the men represented by him also sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the first man Adam sinned, all of his descendants were placed in a sinful position before God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since Adam is the father of the human race, all men are born of him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Adam sinned, he not only represented all mankind but also included the entire human race.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Adam s descendants were in him, even though none of them were born yet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When Adam sinned, his descendants sinned with him and in him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Adam s act of sin caused his descendants to sin in him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Man is sinful at birth; there is no need for him to sin, for he is sinful already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Positionally, man is sinful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Experientially, man is also sinful before God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one can say that he has never sinned or that he has clean hands, an undefiled heart, and no experience of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everyone has experienced lying, stealing, filthy thoughts, or improper behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man s position of sin produces his experience of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man s experience of sin proves his position of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Both positionally and experientially, man is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Fall under the judgment of God ; Condemned already Rom 3:19; John 3:18; see also Rom 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because man has sinned, he is under the judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is righteous, and He is the One who establishes the law.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to His righteousness and His law, He must judge sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s righteousness and God s law place man under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man is under not only God s judgment but also His condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether or not he is aware of it, man has been judged and is condemned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need to wait for God s judgment in the future; man has already received the verdict that he is guilty of sin and is condemned before God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When God condemned Adam because of his sin, God also condemned the entire human race in Adam through his one offense.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today every human being is born a condemned sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The wrath of God abides upon him ; Children of wrath John 3:36; Eph 2:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because men have sinned and transgressed against God s righteousness, they not only are condemned under God s judgment, but as children of wrath under God s wrath, men daily evoke His wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s wrath is like thunder; it is ready to explode upon mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God withholds His wrath in order to give men the opportunity to repent and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s wrath will surely break forth on those who do not repent.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is reserved for men to die once, and after this comes judgment Heb 9:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to God s law, those who sin must die.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Man sinned; therefore, his portion according to God s law the portion reserved for man is death.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Death is set before the unrepentant sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he refuses to repent, he will receive only death under God s wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When death comes to a man, God s wrath explodes upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Death is not the end. After a man dies, he still faces judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although he is already condemned, he will still face another judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In this future judgment, the condemnation under which God has placed man will be executed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Although God condemns man s sin according to His righteousness, He has not yet executed this condemnation because of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God desires man to repent; therefore, He waits and gives man opportunity to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If a man refuses to repent to the very end, he will enter into death and face God s final judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In His judgment God will execute the sentence that He has pronounced upon man.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perish ; Cast into the lake of fire John 3:16; Rev 20:15; see also 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>After an unrepentant man passes through God s final judgment, he will perish; that is, he will be thrown into the lake of fire to suffer eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>According to the Lord s word in Mark 9:48, in the lake of fire their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>How painful and terrible to be eaten by worms and burned by fire!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is man s condition before God.</S>
