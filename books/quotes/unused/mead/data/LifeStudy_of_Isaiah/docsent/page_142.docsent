   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Taking Up the Obstacle</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>out of the Way of Jehovah's People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"It will be said,/Cast up, cast up; prepare the way;/Take up the obstacle out of the way of My people" v. 14 . The greatest obstacle to our Christian life is our failure to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This obstacle must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>C. The Word of the High and Exalted One,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Who Inhabits Eternity, Whose Name Is Holy</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 15 we have the word of the high and exalted One, who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He says, "I will dwell in the high and holy place,/And with the contrite and lowly of spirit,/To revive the spirit of the lowly/And to revive the heart of the contrite."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our heart needs to be revived in one way, and our spirit needs to be revived in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way to have a real revival is to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not contact the Lord, we will not be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>D. Jehovah Not Contending Forever</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>nor Always Being Angry</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 16 Jehovah says that He will not contend forever, nor will He always be angry, for the spirit would faint before Him, and the souls which He has made.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 17 through 19 He goes on to say, "Because of the iniquity of his unjust gain I was angry,/And I struck him; I hid Myself and was angry;/And he went on, turning away in the way of his heart./ I have seen his ways/And will heal him;/And I will lead him and restore comfort to him/And to his mourning ones,/Creating the fruit of the lips:/Peace, peace to him who is far off and to him who is near,/Says Jehovah; and I will heal him."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The expression the fruit of the lips refers to praise and thanksgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word peace in verse 19 is significant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we contact the Lord, have fellowship with Him, and remain in His presence, He will be happy and we will have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Otherwise, He will be unhappy with us and will contend with us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>E. The Wicked Being like the Tossed Sea</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"The wicked are like the tossed sea,/For it cannot be calm,/And its waters toss up mire and mud./There is no peace, says my God, for the wicked" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The wicked ones cannot be calm or have peace; they are like the tossed sea, which is never calm.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The wicked ones do many things, but they cannot have peace, because they do not contact the Lord, rest in Him, and remain in His presence.</S>
