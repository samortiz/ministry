<p>We need to know the genuine meaning of the cross. Yes, the cross is a matter of suffering. Crucifixion was the method used by the Roman government to execute criminals. No doubt, to the criminal, the cross was a suffering because he did not choose to be crucified. On the contrary, he was forced to be crucified. The crucifixion of the Lord Jesus, however, was altogether different. He was not forced to suffer crucifixion; He chose it. This was His own preference. He was not compelled to go to the cross; He was willing to do so because His cross was God&rsquo;s will. Hence, His crucifixion was for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s will. The Lord was willing to take up the cross and be crucified for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. In other words, Christ was not forced to die like a criminal. Rather, He was willing to be crucified that through death His life might be released to produce the church.</p>
<p>No doubt, the cross was a great suffering to the Lord, but He had no thought of reducing the suffering. Rather, when He was offered the wine mingled with gall, He rejected it (Matt. 27:34; Mark 15:23). The Lord did not care for the suffering; He cared for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose. When He was on the cross, the Lord suffered greatly. But that suffering was not forced upon Him. He took it willingly. In Matthew 26:39 the Lord prayed to the Father, &ldquo;Not as I will, but as You will.&rdquo; At that same time He also prayed, &ldquo;Your will be done.&rdquo; The Lord was willing to take up the cross, to go to the cross, and to remain on the cross until God&rsquo;s will had been fulfilled. This is the significance of the first mention of the cross in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT CRIMINALS,<br />
BUT WILLING BEARERS OF THE CROSS</h2>
<p>According to this principle of first mention, all the other crosses must be the same as the first cross. This means that we are not forced to bear the cross, but that we willingly take it up. Notice, the Lord Jesus did not say, &ldquo;Let him deny himself and be crucified.&rdquo; No, He said, &ldquo;Let him take up his cross.&rdquo; We are not to be crucified, but we are to pick up the cross. However, certain brothers have said, &ldquo;I have been crucified by my dear wife many times.&rdquo; Such brothers are not cross-bearers; they are criminals executed by their wives. If you say that your children are crucifying you, you are not a cross-bearer, but an executed criminal. Today most Christians are criminals being executed; very few are cross-bearers. Let me ask you this question: Are you a criminal or a cross-bearer? We all need to say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, I am not a criminal. I am one who is willing to bear the cross. I have not been crucified by others; rather, I take up the cross and bear it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR TURN TO TAKE UP THE CROSS</h2>
<p>We have seen that the Lord did not suffer as a criminal, but that He willingly took up His cross. He was a willing and happy cross-bearer for the purpose of fulfilling God&rsquo;s will to produce the church. Through His death, His divine life was released to us, making us the members of the church. Today the problem is not with Him; it is with us. Although we have the divine life within us and have become members of the church, the problem is whether or not we shall be built up. We all have the divine life in us for the church, but we have not yet been built together. Throughout the centuries, Christians have had the divine life in them for the church, but there has not been the building. Instead, there has been dissension, division, and confusion. Where is the building? Christ has done His best. Now it is our turn to take up the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS BEING GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>To take up the cross simply means to take up God&rsquo;s will. The cross is actually God&rsquo;s will. Anything that is not God&rsquo;s will is not a cross. The cross experienced by Christ definitely was God&rsquo;s will. If God&rsquo;s will had been that Christ should not die on the cross, yet Christ still went there and died, He would have been acting contrary to God&rsquo;s will. In such a case, that would not have been a cross, but the execution of a criminal. However, the cross through which the Lord Jesus passed was not a criminal execution, but the will of God.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s ordination in the Bible, there is one husband for one wife. Consider how Abraham obtained a wife for his son Isaac. Before Abraham&rsquo;s servant brought Rebekah to Isaac, Isaac had never seen her. But when she was brought to him, he took her as his wife. This indicates that marriage, by whatever means it takes place, is sovereignly under the hand of God. Once you have married a certain one, she is your wife, and there is nothing more you can do about it. According to God&rsquo;s ordination, there must be no divorce. One husband for one wife is God&rsquo;s will. If you divorce your wife, you divorce yourself from God&rsquo;s will. But if you accept her, you accept God&rsquo;s will, because she represents God&rsquo;s will and even is His will. God&rsquo;s will is always a cross. However, if you suffer your wife as a cross, you are a criminal. But if you willingly take her by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, you are a cross-bearer. You willingly take up the cross; you are not executed. You recognize that your wife is God&rsquo;s will and ordination.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother&rsquo;s wife causes him to suffer. Since no divorce is permitted, he has two choices regarding her. He may either suffer with her like a criminal being executed on the cross, or he may take her as God&rsquo;s will and as his lot and portion. He may say, &ldquo;God has allotted her to me. It was not I that married her; it was God who gave her to me. This is God&rsquo;s will, God&rsquo;s ordination. Hallelujah, I am willing and happy to bear the cross! I am not a criminal, but a happy cross-bearer.&rdquo; If we do this, the presence of the Lord will be with us, and we shall enjoy the riches of life. Furthermore, we shall have a strong testimony of being built into one.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> </body></html>
