<h1 class=series>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO HUNDRED SIXTY</h1><h1 class=title>THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1><h1 class=msg>(7)</h1><p>The ultimate consummation of God’s eternal economy, His eternal plan, is the mingling of the processed and consummated Triune God with His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. God is in this mingling, and His chosen people also are in this mingling. This mingling is God’s dwelling place; it is also the dwelling place of His chosen people. Hence, this mingling is a mutual dwelling place. Furthermore, this mingling is the counterpart of Christ, our eternal destiny, and the ultimate manifestation of the processed Triune God for His expression. This mingling will also be the kingship and the priesthood over the nations on the new earth for eternity to express God and to glorify Him to the uttermost. This mingling, therefore, is the ultimate consummation of God’s work in the universe, including His work both of the old creation and of the new creation.<p>The last two chapters of the Bible, Revelation 21 and 22, present the ultimate consummation of God’s eternal economy. These chapters are all-inclusive and cover nearly the entire Bible. For example, in the Old Testament we see the tabernacle, the temple, and the city. These three things are found also in the last two chapters of the Bible. Redemption, regeneration, transformation, glorification, conformation, and many other matters are symbolized in these chapters.<p>Concerning the New Jerusalem as the holy city revealed in Revelation 21 and 22, we have seen that this city is built with all the redeemed and perfected saints, that the twelve gates on four sides signify the mingling of man with the Triune God, and that the city proper is a mountain of gold. In this message we will consider the foundation of the holy city.<h2 class=head2>D. The Foundation</h2><p>Revelation 21:14 says, “The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” These foundations are not “the foundation,” which is Christ, as mentioned in 1 Corinthians 3:10-11. Rather, the twelve foundations here are “the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” Today the church is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets (Eph. 2:20). Since in eternity there will be no more need of the prophets, the foundations of the holy city will consist only of the apostles.
