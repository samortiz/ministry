 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE MIRACULOUS NORMALITY<br />
IN GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:3, 5-6; Acts 13:52; Eph. 3:19b; 5:18; Acts 4:8, 31; 2:17-18; Luke 24:49</h1>
<p>According to my study of the Bible and my Christian experiences, I realized that in my Christian life the things that I experience of Christ, of the Triune God, of the Spirit, and of the divine life with the divine nature, are altogether normal to me. They are a normality. At the beginning of my Christian life, I read the writings of some inner-life teachers who taught that all these spiritual and divine things were great miracles that were not easy to attain. They indicated that a number of requirements had to be fulfilled for us to reach a point where we were qualified to receive these miracles. I tried to experience these things according to the instructions given in their books. Eventually, I found out that the experiences of the Spirit in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy were not according to what they taught. Actually, all the spiritual and divine things that are provided by God for our enjoyment are altogether normal. They are normalities. But I also found out that these normalities are miraculous to the uttermost.</p>
<p>About six months ago, I had a burden to release the truth concerning this matter. As I was writing an outline for my message, I was considering what term I should use to describe my experiences of these spiritual and divine things according to the holy revelation. I realized that what I had experienced was really normal but that it was also miraculous to the uttermost. Thus, I picked up the words <em>normal</em> and <em>miracle</em> to come up with the phrase <em>miraculous normality.</em> If we desire to properly and adequately visit people by knocking on their doors for gospel preaching and have the proper home meetings, we must have the experience of the miraculous normality. We must know what the miraculous normality is to be adequately qualified to carry out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the processed Triune God. To open up our mouths and call is most normal. It is normal to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; We can call on the Lord&rsquo;s name in any way, at any time, and in any place. Thank the Lord for the normality of calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; But when we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; do you realize what we get? We get the processed Triune God! This is miraculous. To get the processed Triune God is the top miracle, the greatest miracle among all the miracles. In order to receive Him, there is no need for me to dress up, make myself extremely neat, and be reverent by kneeling down in a proper way to pray in a formal way. There is no need for me to &ldquo;wait on the Lord&rdquo; for a number of days before I can contact, receive, and enjoy Him. All that I need to do is call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; and I get the processed Triune God for my enjoyment. This is the greatest miracle in this universe and the totality and absolute aggregate of all the miracles throughout all the generations. This is altogether miraculous, yet it is so normal. We can call on the Lord&rsquo;s name while we are driving or before we go to bed. Quite often when I go to bed at night, I call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus&rdquo; right before I go to sleep. What an enjoyment! This is both normal and miraculous, a miraculous normality. Calling on the name of the Lord is a normality that transpires with me all the time, yet it is miraculous that when I call I receive the totality of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>According to my Christian experience, in God&rsquo;s entire economy, all the Christian experiences such as salvation, redemption, justification, sanctification, transformation, renewing, conformation, glorification, and speaking with the authority of the Lord in the power of the Spirit can be classified into three categories: regeneration, being filled with the Spirit essentially, and being filled with the Spirit economically.</p>
