<h2 class="head4">The Mind Being Limited</h2><p>Many people like to indulge themselves in their own whimsical thoughts. From morning until night they are lost in wild imaginations. Their mind is like a machine that is on all day long; it is always busy. They exhaust all of their mental energy on their thoughts. When the spirit calls for the mind to help, there is no strength left in the mind. The spirit wants to flow out, but the mind cannot provide a channel for its release. This means that the mind has formed a strong blockage. The sharper a man's mind is, the duller he can be to spiritual things. A smart person needs God's mercy to control his thoughts. When the spirit within has something to say, our mind should be able to convey this word to others. We must control our mind. If our mind spins around all day long, it will not be able to meet the spirit's demand. The brothers from northern Kiangsu are very smart; they are rich in thought and knowledge. However, they have not acquired much reality in spiritual things. Many people are needlessly grieving for the Spirit. However, the Bible only says that we should not grieve the Spirit. These ones do not have to think so much; they do not have to be anxious for so many things. When the spirit wants to be released, it needs the support of the mind. The inner man is expressed through the outer man. The busier a man's mind is, the less his spirit can be expressed. The mind of one who is broken in the outer man can respond to the words and directions of the spirit. If a man's mind is always occupied with his own things, his inner man will be bound. The inner man cannot survive alone or move independently.</p><h2 class="head4">The Will Being Limited</h2><p>Some people like to be others' counselors. They even like to be God's counselors. They like to make proposals, suggestions, and arrangements, and they like to give directions. If they use up their entire will on these things, they are powerless to serve God when their will is called upon by God to obey Him. A person with a pliable will before God is very decisive when it comes to making a stand for God. Throughout history we can see some of the most pliable persons making some of the toughest decisions. Those who have been touched by God in their will do not like to make their own proposals. The will does not become stronger through repeated use. If we wear it out, it will not serve us when we have to make necessary decisions before God. A strong-willed person often crumples to the floor as soon as he faces opposition. His will is strong in things related to the self, but he falls as soon as he faces some tests from God. Peter was a strong-willed person before he experienced the Lord's dealing. His toughness was undealt with; it was a toughness within himself. This toughness led to his denial of the Lord three times. It is difficult for the Lord to teach those whose natural will is strong. When Peter was threatened by death, he ran away. His toughness was raw. He needed the Lord to deal with him thoroughly and to break his natural toughness into pieces. This was the only way his will could be used by his spirit. Many martyrs were strong in their will because they were dealt with by the Lord. Their will was both pliable and strong.</p><h2 class="head4">Conditions after the Breaking of the Outer Man</h2><p>What conditions do we find after the outer man is broken? First, a man who is broken is a right person; he becomes proper in the eyes of God. What then is a revival? A revival is the result of men being broken before God. When men are broken, they are revived. Where there is breaking, there is revival. A broken man can bring revival wherever he goes. This revival does not come through prayer. (I am not by any means despising revivals that come through prayer.) Some people think that prayer changes the mind of an unwilling and reluctant God and forces Him to bless us. However, God is the God of all blessings. Even though He is very eager to bless us, He often does not find the right persons to bless; He does not find the proper channel. This is the reason He wants us to pray. We do not pray to make God willing. Rather, we pray to make ourselves right. We do not struggle to make God willing. Rather, we give ourselves to His breaking so that we become right persons before God. Then God will have a way through us. If the outer man is not broken, the spirit will not be released with power.</p><p>God makes His advance through a broken man. As soon as a man is broken, the distance between his spirit and other men is shortened; he becomes approachable to others. His spirit is free to move anytime. He does not have to go around in circles trying to say what he wants to say. His outer shell is broken, and the separation between him and others is gone. Others can draw near to him easily, and he will know men easily. He becomes very approachable and very ready to render help to others.</p><p>A person can take control of his own spirit if his outer man is broken. He can use his spirit anytime. Even when power is released from his spirit, he will still be in control. We have to be willing to fall before God and to accept His breaking. Then we will be able to take control of our spirit, and we will bring blessing to every meeting. Whether or not a meeting will receive blessing depends on us; we can control the amount of blessing a meeting receives. Once we are dealt with by the Lord, we can control our spirit. When we push out our spirit, it will be released, and we will bring blessing to the meeting. Once we can exercise our inner man at will, our spirit will not be affected by our outer man. We will be able to control our spirit. We will become God's minister, and we will be free to dispense blessing to a meeting or withhold blessing from it. The power to control one's spirit rests with the minister.</p>
