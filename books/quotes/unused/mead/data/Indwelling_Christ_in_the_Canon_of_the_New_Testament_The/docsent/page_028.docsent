   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FALLEN AND INDEPENDENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regardless of how spiritual we are, we must remember that we are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We were born fallen because our first father fell six thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A fallen person is an independent person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All mothers know that there is not one child that is not independent.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether they are American, Chinese, Western or Oriental, the first word they learn is No!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever their mothers say, the answer is No!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our fallen nature is independent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even the sisters who are wives are still very independent.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, they would say it in a nicer way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They would say that to keep their independence is to keep their prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For them to submit to their husbands is to lose their prestige.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But that is really not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The case is just the independence of our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The principle of the tree of knowledge is simply the principle of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Knowledge makes people independent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Students, after they finish their course, graduate from school and then become so independent.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But can you graduate from life?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why the principle of the tree of life is dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yesterday we ate, we drank, we breathed, and we slept.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But today we still must do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We could never say that because we learned to breathe well yesterday, that today we have graduated from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You can graduate from any kind of knowledge, but you cannot graduate from anything of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The tree of life means dependence, and the tree of knowledge means independence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It was at the fall of man that the tree of knowledge, which means the nature of independence, got into man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why we were born independent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>GOD S SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, God s economy depends upon our dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On one hand God created us as an individual with a proper will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Yet in God s salvation, God comes into us that we may take Him as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that we should no longer live by ourself, but by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>To say this is easy, but to experience it is not so easy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let me illustrate.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God has created you as a complete unit, a perfect individual.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You have your will, your likes, and your dislikes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You have your thoughts and intentions.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are a perfect individual being.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You also have your personality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, God s creation is one thing, but God s salvation is another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God s creation is to create us in such a way, but in His salvation, He Himself comes into us to be our life and our person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He dwells in us, and we must live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is really good, but we have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Now besides ourself, we have another person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that now we must be willing to be dependent upon this person, forgetting about ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In all weddings, the bride has her head covered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that in a family, there can be only one head.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But immediately after the wedding, they take away the covering.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To tell the truth, I have never seen a person fully dependent upon and submissive to another person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I never saw such a one because we were all born fallen and independent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To our feeling, to depend upon others is a kind of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE NEED OF PRESSURE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in God s salvation, what is needed is our dependence.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, it is not easy to give up our independence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, the pressure is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He brings in a certain kind of pressure to take away our independence.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is why there is not one Christian that does not have trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Nearly all the husbands are a tribulation to the wives, and all the wives are a tribulation to the husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Moreover, all the children are tribulations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I met a certain brother in 1958, and then I saw him again in 1960.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time I realized that he had nearly no pressure from the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But just five years later, in 1965, I noticed that the little ones had become a pressure to him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are no parents who can testify that their children are not a pressure to them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Every child is a tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The more children you have, the more tribulations you have.</S>
