   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All of the priests as well as the entire tabernacle with all of its parts were under the anointing of the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Without this anointing, none of them could have been holy, that is, none of them could have been attached to God, joined to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's divine essence would have had nothing to do with any part of the tabernacle or with any one of the priests if they had not been anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that under the anointing of the compound Spirit, there is the dwelling place of God, the church life, the priesthood, and the real serving body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to see that the Spirit is no longer the Spirit of God possessing merely divinity; the Spirit today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The compound ointment in Exodus 30 is the holy anointing oil.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be holy is to be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regardless of how perfect you are, if you are not one with God and if God is not one with you, you are not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What we need today in the church life is the anointing of the holy anointing oil, the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can never build up a proper church life by teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many years ago when people came to me with questions and problems, I was able to give them an answer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today I have only one thing to say: "Go to the Lord and ask Him."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many years ago I taught people how to take care of their children, but that teaching did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Teaching does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you teach me to be humble again and again, I can never be humble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The more teaching I get about being humble, the prouder I will become.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I could give you the best teaching on how we need to love one another, but eventually we will argue with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Teaching stirs up the thinking of the mentality, the exercise of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It does not minister life to people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What we need today is not teaching but the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Every part of the tabernacle had to be anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It would have been foolish to teach the parts of the tabernacle to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They did not need teaching to be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They needed something to make them holy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As the New Testament dwelling place of God, we also need something to make us holy the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do not teach me; instead, pour the compound Spirit upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then even though I may not know the teaching of holiness, I am really holy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What we need is the reality, not the empty teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need the reality of brotherly love, not the teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need the essence of love, not the mere terminology of love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What we need today is to be anointed with God's essence by the anointing of the compound Spirit.</S>
