<h2 class=head2>B. The Triune God—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob</h2><p>Furthermore, this God is of three aspects. He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. This title clearly shows us God in His three aspects. The God of Abraham is God the Father, the God of Isaac is God the Son, and the God of Jacob is God the Spirit. Jacob was a hard case, but God the Spirit came specifically to deal with such hard cases. In his entire life, Jacob was under the transforming work of God the Spirit, and eventually, he became Israel, the prince of God.<p>The Triune God is just one God. God is one, yet He has the aspect of three: the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The Father is the Planner, the Designer, and the One who purposed. The Son is the Accomplisher and the Finisher, and the Spirit is the Executor. The Father is the source, the Son is the course, and the Spirit is the flow. The Father came forth in the Son to accomplish what He had planned, and the Son, after accomplishing everything, came into us as the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, God is triune that He may enter into us to be our enjoyment. This One whom we enjoy as the Triune God is all-inclusive and unlimited. When we enjoy Him, we enjoy both His all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness. We all have to know Him to such an extent.<h2 class=head2>C. The Angel of Jehovah, the Triune God</h2><p>This Jehovah who is self-existing and ever-existing, the Triune God, also came to be an Angel, a sent One. He Himself came to be His own sent One. This Angel of Jehovah, this One who was sent by Jehovah, was the Triune God Himself. We have to understand that this One is our Lord Jesus. On the one hand, Exodus 3 is very simple with only a few verses concerning Him, but on the other hand, these verses are all-inclusive. He is self-existing and ever-existing, He is the I Am, and He is God. He is also the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—the Triune God. Finally, He is His own Angel. These are the aspects of Christ as God.<h2 class=head1>II. A MAN OF BLOOD AND FLESH IN TIME—A CREATURE</h2><p>Another aspect of what Christ is, is that He is man. As God, He is related to us not directly but indirectly. Two thousand years after He created man, He came to tell Abraham, “Abraham, I will cause you to have a seed who will be a blessing to the nations.” Who was this seed? Paul told us later that this seed was Jesus Christ. Matthew 1:1 says, “Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.” This son of Abraham is Christ. After the promise was given, another two thousand years passed, and when human history fully reached four thousand years, He came. How did He come? It is marvelous that He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and the Spirit is for reaching man; when He reached man, He came as the Spirit. The Holy Spirit came upon an unmarried woman, a pure virgin named Mary. He entered into the womb of this virgin and was conceived there. This almighty God, the Triune God, the Lord who is self-existing and ever-existing, the eternal Lord, entered into the womb of a little virgin for His conception, and He remained in the womb for nine months. He was there fully abiding by the natural laws that He had ordained in creation. According to the natural laws set up by Him, human conception must take nine months, so He waited there for nine months. Then He was born of the virgin to become a man of blood and flesh. This man had a nose, eyes, skin, flesh, bones, and blood. To be sure, He was a man, but this man possessed not only the human nature but also the divine nature. The conception of Christ was a mingling of two natures, divinity and humanity. Therefore, the elements within Him were divinity mingled with humanity. For this reason, Isaiah 9:6 says that the child born in the manger was the mighty God. This One was the God-man, who was both God and man and who was God yet man.<h2 class=head2>A. Being the Complete God Who Became Flesh, Possessing the Complete Divine Nature</h2><p>This God who was conceived in humanity is not a partial God but the complete God, the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We Christians often have a wrong natural concept, thinking that the Lord Jesus became flesh as the Son of God only. You must know that there is no such statement in the entire New Testament. The New Testament says that in the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, the Word was God, and the Word became flesh. Thus, the Word is not a partial God, but the complete God. He was not God the Son only; rather, He was God the complete Triune God—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Therefore, He possessed the complete divine nature. This is why Paul said in Romans 9:5 that Christ is God over all, blessed forever. Our Lord Jesus is not the Son of God only. He is God, even the complete God.
