As believers in Christ we need a basic knowledge concerning Christs person and work which are the main constituents of the Christian faith
As the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Christ is the origination and the source of all the created things
Through Him' indicates that Christ is the active instrument through which the creation of all things was processed
He was not merely an objective Creator but also the subjective instrument through which creation was processed
Speaking of Christ John 13 says All things came into being through Him and apart from Him nothing came into being which has come into being
Only when we are in eternity shall we have a full understanding of how much was involved and implied in Christ's incarnation
It was surely a marvelous thing for God to come into man by means of Christ's work in incarnation and to be born of mankind through a virgin
It is crucial for us to realize that not only was a human child born, but God Himself was involved in that birth
Through Christ's work in His incarnation not only was God brought into man, but God was also made one with man
The Bible reveals clearly that through Christ's incarnation God in His divinity was made one with man in humanity
The two essences of divinity and humanity were made into a single entity without a third essence being produced
God is still God, and man is still man, yet they have become one person, Christ, the God-man, in whom God is one with man
Christ was conceived of the Holy Spirit with the divine essence and born of a human virgin with a human essence
Through this great work accomplished by Christ, God was made one with man so that He might be manifested in the flesh
All genuine Christians, all who hold to the common faith , must believe in the Triune God and in Christ's incarnation
In incarnation Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, accomplished the great work of bringing God into man and of making God one with man
While He was living and walking on earth, inwardly He was God, and outwardly He was a man in the flesh, for He wore this man as a garment
John 4:2 says, 'In this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesses Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is out of God'
To confess Jesus coming in the flesh is to confess that He was divinely conceived to be born as the Son of God
Truly, through His work in incarnation Christ became a man in the flesh, putting man in the flesh upon Himself
He worked everywhere and all the time because His work was His life, His life was His move, and His move was His work
We need a living that matches our ministry for the Lord, a living that is the ground and support of our service for Him
Because we need such a living, it takes many years before one who desires to serve the Lord can be truly useful to Him in His ministry
When Christ became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in fashion as a man by men
In His incarnation the Lord Jesus did not alter His divine nature but only His outward expression of the form of God to that of a slave
He became a man and then lived a human life for thirty years, living in the poor and lowly home of a carpenter
Paul surely selected the right words, telling us that Christ was found in fashion as a man and that He took the form of a slave
In such a work Christ was found in fashion as a man, not in loftiness but in lowliness, fineness, and patience
The Word is God expressed, life is God imparted, light is God shining, grace is God enjoyed, and reality is God realized
Although no one has ever seen God, Christ in His human living has declared God in the way of being the Word, life, light, grace, and reality
They must have realized that there was something excellent and extraordinary with Him, something higher than the expression only of humanity
Because the Lord Jesus was built up in this way, when He came out to minister, He did not need to pretend or to perform
In verse 7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known His Father also
If we have seen the Son, we have seen the Father because the Father is embodied in the Son to be expressed through Him in His human living
The Lord Jesus lived a genuine human life, yet in His human life we see the divine element and also certain divine factors
According to verses 43 through 48, the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem, and His parents did not know it
In His humanity Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Man, cared for the things of the Father, for God's interests
Luke 4:18a says, 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to bring good news to the poor'
As used in Mark 1:15, the word 'repent' literally means to think differently afterward, that is, to have a change of mind
Matthew 8:2 says, 'Behold, a leper approached and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me'
Leprosy not only requires healing as do other diseases; it also requires cleansing like sin , because of its filthy and contaminating nature
He volunteered, in His tender mercy, His power of resurrection to raise the widow's son from death, without being asked to do so
In His raising up the dead son and giving him to his mother, we see the expression of Christ's divine attributes in His human virtues
In verse 25 the Lord said to Martha, 'I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me, even if he should die, shall live'
The Lord proceeded to demonstrate this fact by raising up Lazarus: 'He cried out with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth!
A man with an unclean spirit cried out, and the Lord Jesus rebuked him saying, 'Be quiet, and come out of him'!
The fallen angels work with Satan in the air , and these demons, the unclean spirits, move with him on the earth
By the Lord's word here we see that the battle fought for the kingdom is not fought by man alone but by a man with the Spirit of God
The Lord Jesus said that He cast out demons by the Spirit of God and that this is the coming of the kingdom of God
A wedding feast signifies the pleasure and enjoyment of human life, and wine, the life juice of the grape, signifies life
When the wine, the center of the enjoyment of the wedding feast, runs out, the pleasure of the wedding feast is gone
Since the water signifies death and the wine signifies life, Christ's changing water into wine signifies that He changes death into life
When in our experience the Lord Jesus changes our water into wine, our death into life, the wine in our 'wedding feast' will never end
We shall have an eternal wedding feast, a feast not in our natural life but in the new life, the divine life, received through regeneration
The number five, composed of four, representing the creatures , and one, representing the Creator , signifies responsibility
The barley loaves of the plant life signify the generating aspect of Christ's life, and the fishes signify the redeeming aspect of His life
In His redeeming life, as typified by the two fishes, Christ lived a victorious life in the 'death waters' of the sinful world
Christ's shed blood accomplished redemption for us, and the water from His wounded side imparted His life to us
Now we can understand why the five barley loaves were accompanied by the two fishes, which signify the animal life for redemption
The Lord is signified by both the barley loaves and the fishes, for He is the plant life to generate us and the animal life to redeem us
Matthew 20:28a indicates that in His earthly ministry Christ served people: 'The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve'
Such a One served sinners as their Savior, with His life as their ransom , for the fulfillment of the eternal purpose of God
Another aspect of Christ's earthly ministry was His shining upon the people in darkness and the shadow of death
Andrew, a disciple of John the Baptist, had brought Peter to the Lord, in the place where John preached, prior to this
Christ's calling of these four disciples was the foundation for the establishment of the kingdom of the heavens
In verse 9 He continues, 'I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out and shall find pasture'
Now that Christ has come, the sheep, God's chosen people, must come out of the sheepfold and come into Him to enjoy Him as their pasture
The reason the Lord Jesus did not leave the sheep in the sheepfold was that the age, the dispensation, had been changed
In John 10:11 the Lord Jesus says, 'I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep'
In the human life we are condemned and divided; in the divine life we are accepted and united and become one entity, one flock in one life
Since this is the eternal life that lasts forever, whoever possesses it will by no means perish forever, that is, for eternity
Matthew 4:17 says, 'From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near'
In Luke 6:13 the Lord Jesus called His disciples, and 'He chose from among them twelve, whom He also named apostles'
Luke 9:1 says, 'Having called together the twelve, He gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to heal diseases'
In particular, it is to preach the positive aspect of the jubilee-the recovery of our lost right to the enjoyment of God in Christ
The Lord appointed seventy others, and sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come'
He appointed seventy disciples to share His ministry, even as Moses appointed seventy elders to share his burden as God charged him
Three things are interrelated: the word of the kingdom, the sons of the kingdom, and Christ Himself as the life within the seed
The kingdom is brought into being not by teaching or working but by sowing Christ as the living word of life into humanity
The Sower is Christ, and the seed also is Christ, Christ in the word sown into us to make us sons of the kingdom
The growth of this life depends upon the condition of the served ones, its issue differing according to their various conditions
If we say that we are practicing the kingdom life, we need to realize that this kingdom is not an organization
The Lord Jesus said to Simon the Pharisee, 'A certain moneylender had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty
Simon answered, 'I suppose the one whom he graciously forgave the more,' and the Lord replied, 'You judged correctly'
Regarding the two debtors who were forgiven by the moneylender, the Lord asked, 'Which of them therefore will love him more'?
To a self-justified lawyer who asked what he could do to inherit eternal life, the Lord Jesus told the parable of the good Samaritan
In this parable we see Christ as the One who can render us full salvation; we also see our need for this salvation
The self-justified one was helped to know that he needed a loving neighbor to love him, not a neighbor to be loved by him
The Lord said, 'Take heed and guard yourself from all covetousness; for no one's life is in the abundance of his possessions'
The point here is that as those who would enjoy God's salvation, we should not hold on to material possessions as an earthly treasure
God, as the certain man, has prepared His full salvation as a great dinner and sent the first apostles as His slaves to invite the Jews
After that, because there was still room in God's salvation, God sent His slaves into the Gentile world to gather more people into His feast
Eventually those who had first been invited by Godthe Pharisees the scribes and the lawyerswill not be able to enter into the kingdom of God
The three parables in 15:3-32 emphasize the love of the divine Trinity more than the fallen condition and repentance of the penitent sinner
In Luke we first have the Son as the shepherd, then the Spirit as the woman, and finally the Father as the father receiving his returned son
The reason the Son is mentioned first in Luke 15 is that in God's salvation the One who comes, practically speaking, is the Son
In 18:9-14 we have Christ's teaching about our need to humble ourselves in order to enter into the kingdom of God
In verses 10 through 13 the Lord tells of two men who went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector
The prayer of the Pharisee sounds not like a prayer but rather like an accusation of others and an arrogant boast to God
He asked God to be propitiated, to be appeased toward him by a propitiation, so that He may be merciful and gracious to him
He realized that he had offended God and that he needed someone to be his offering of propitiation so that God would be appeased
In 14b the Lord concludes, 'Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, but he who humbles himself shall be exalted'
In 18:18-30 we see that if we would enter into the kingdom of God, we need to renounce all and follow the Lord Jesus
For it is easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God'
Having the natural concept of being saved, they did not grasp the Lord's revelation concerning entering into the kingdom of God
To enter into this enjoyment in the coming age is to enter into the coming kingdom and participate in its enjoyment of eternal life
The followers of the Lord Jesus should appropriate Him as their Bridegroom so that they may have a living enjoyment in His presence
When we receive His life, it works within us to stir us up and excite us, to strengthen us, energize us, and make us happy
In order to enjoy Christ as the Bridegroom, we need Him as our new garment outwardly and as our new wine inwardly
Old wineskins signify religious practices, such as the fasting practiced by the Pharisees and the disciples of John in their religion
The believers are built into the church , and the church is expressed through the local churches in which they live
Christ is not only our new garment and new wine, but, being increased, He is also our new wineskin to contain the wine
He is our outward qualification He is our inward satisfaction and in a corporate way He is the church the Body capable of holding the wine
Now the real David and His followers were also rejected and took action to eat, apparently against the sabbatical regulation
King David and his followers were rejected by the people, and the real David and his followers were rejected also
Neither David and his followers nor Christ and His followers had anything to eat, but there was a place where there was something to eat
It is important for us to see that Christ's word here implies the dispensational change from the priesthood to the kingship
Christs revealing to the Pharisees that He is greater than the temple is another change a typefulfilling change from the temple to a person
In this case, a case concerning the priests, it is a change from the temple to One who is greater than the temple
The first section, 5:1-12, depicts the nature of the people of the kingdom of the heavens under nine blessings
To be poor in spirit is to be emptied in our spirit, in the depths of our being, in order to realize and possess the kingdom of the heavens
To mourn according to God and His economy is to mourn over the situation of the world, which is altogether contrary to God's economy
To be pure in heart is to be single in purpose, to have the single goal of accomplishing God's will for God's glory
To be a peacemaker is to make peace with all men by behaving in the Father's life and according to His peaceful nature
To be persecuted for the sake of righteousness is to pay a price for the righteousness we seek for the kingdom of the heavens
Christ's keeping of the law qualified Him to fulfill the requirement of the law through His substitutionary death on the cross
In 5:48 the Lord concludes this section by saying, 'You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect'
The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet this demand
In 6:19-34, the fifth section, we have the Lord's word concerning the dealing of the kingdom people with riches
According to verse 21, the kingdom people must send their treasure to heaven so that their heart may also be in heaven
Mammon, standing in opposition to God, indicates that wealth or riches are the opponent of God, robbing God's people of their service to Him
As part of His word about anxiety, the Lord says, 'Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you'
In the next section, 7:1-12, we have Christ's word concerning the principles of the kingdom people in dealing with others
The kingdom people, living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always judge themselves, not others
Finally, in the last section we have Christ's teaching concerning the ground of the kingdom people's living and work
The kingdom people's living and work must be founded on the word of Christ for the accomplishment of the will of the heavenly Father
The wayside signifies the heart that is hardened by worldly traffic and does not open to understand the word of the kingdom
The rocky places signify the heart that is shallow in receiving the word of the kingdom because of the things hidden in such a heart
Both the tares and the wheat grow in the field; that is, the false believers and the true ones live in the world
The church, as the practical kingdom of the heavens, with Christ-the unleavened fine flour-as its contents, should be unleavened bread
The treasure hidden in the field must consist of gold or precious stone, the materials for the building of the church and the New Jerusalem
The parable in Matthew 20:1-16, which is an explanation of the Lord's word to Peter in 19:28-30, concerns the kingdom reward
Peter needed to realize that having forsaken every entanglement and frustration he would receive the kingdom as a reward not as a recompense
The Lord does not act according to the commercial principle which says that the more we pay, the more we receive
He tells of a householder who has a vineyard and who goes out at different times during the day to hire workmen
The Lord was right to give the same thing to the latest workmen according to His own wish, in the principle not of work but of grace
Peter's concept, in dealing with the Lord in 19:27, was altogether commercial, according to the principle of work
In His answer to Peter the Lord strongly indicated that His reward to His followers is not commercial but according to His desire and grace
In verse 33 the householder is God, the vineyard is the city of Jerusalem , and the husbandmen are the leaders of the Israelites
Verse 38 indicates that the Jewish leaders were jealous of Christ's rights, wanting to maintain their false position
The stone in verse 42 is Christ for God's building , and the builders are the Jewish leaders, who were supposed to work on God's building
In verse 43 the Lord Jesus says, 'The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it'
Verses 3 and 4 say, 'He sent his slaves to call those who were invited to the marriage feast, and they would not come
The overcomers, the chosen ones, will be rewarded and qualified to participate in the marriage feast of the Lamb
There is spiritual warfare between Satan's power, which is his kingdom, and the church, which is God's kingdom
Chapter sixteen relates to the universal building of the church, but chapter eighteen relates to the local practice of the church
Verses 1 through 6 speak of Jesus going through death and Christ coming in resurrection to bring the believers into the Father
The Father's house, according to the book's own interpretation in 2:16 and 21, is the temple, the body of Christ, as God's dwelling place
In His resurrection, the church is the Body of Christ, which is the house of God , God's habitation , God's temple
Between man and God there are many obstacles, such as sin, sins, death, the world, the flesh, the self, the old man, and Satan
He had to go to the cross to accomplish redemption so that He might open the way and make a standing for man to get into God
Anyone who does not have the standing, a place, in God, does not have a place in the Body of Christ, which is God's dwelling place
The Son is the embodiment and expression of the Father, and the Spirit is the reality and realization of the Son
The Father in the Son is expressed among the believers, and the Son as the Spirit is realized in the believers
God the Father is hidden God the Son is manifested among men and God the Spirit enters into man to be his life life supply and everything
The very 'He' who is the Spirit of reality in John 14:17, becomes the very 'I' who is the Lord Himself in verse 18
In verse 23 He says If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
Eventually, this will be a mutual abode for the Triune God to abide in the believers and for the believers to abide in Him
The work of the Spirit is first to convict the world, and then, as the Spirit of reality, to guide the believers into all the reality
These three aspects of the Spirit's work correspond to the three sections of John's writing: the Gospel, the Epistles, and the Revelation
John 2:14 through 16 says that He 'found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the moneychangers sitting there
The Father was not simply an instrument through which or by which the Son lived rather the Father was the cause of the Sons living on earth
Without the Father as His cause, the Son's living on earth for thirty-three and a half years would have been vain
They did not know that there was no rest for the Father and the Son as long as the poor sinners were not saved
Having come in the Father's name , He never did anything in His own name; He did everything in the Father's name
When Christ worked with the Father, He worked not with the Father who was merely in heaven, but with the Father who was with Him and in Him
A number of times the Lord Jesus declared strongly that He did not do His own will, but that everything He did was the Father's will
In John 6:38 the Lord Jesus says that He came down from heaven not to do His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him
These verses indicate clearly that in His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus did not carry out His own will but the Father's will
During His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus spoke much concerning the kingdom of God and the dispensing of the Triune God
The fact that the Son expresses the Father is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip in John 14
In verse 7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known the Father also
In John 17:26 the Lord Jesus went on to say in His prayer, 'I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known'
Because the Father's life has been imparted into us, spontaneously the Father is made known to us by life, not by teaching
He lived the Father, He worked with the Father, He spoke the Father's word, He did the Father's will, and He expressed the Father
Everything the Lord Jesus did was for the expression of the Father and was the carrying out of the Father's will
The end spoken of in verse 6 is the consummation of the age , which will be the three and a half years of the great tribulation
The gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole earth for a testimony to all the nations before the end of this age comes
In 24:15-31 the Lord prophesies concerning the great tribulation , His coming to the earth , and the gathering of Israel
In Matthew 2427 the Lord says As the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west so shall the coming of the Son of Man be
The believers, however, should soberly know that Christ is coming to execute God's judgment upon this corrupted world
In 25:1-30 the Lord continues His prophecy concerning the church with a parable for watchfulness and a parable for faithfulness
Whereas the oil in the parable of the virgins signifies the Spirit of God, the talents in verse 15 signify spiritual gifts
For life we need oil, the Spirit of God, even His fullness, that we may be enabled to live the virgin life for the Lord's testimony
For service, for work, we need the talent, the spiritual gift that we may be equipped as a good slave for the Lord's accomplishment
Verse 31 says, 'When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the angels with Him, then He shall sit on His throne of glory'
Christ's judgment of the living Gentiles will occur after His judgment on the believers at His judgment seat in the air
As they were eating, Jesus took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is My body'
By participating in this life we become the mystical body of Christ , which is also signified by the bread of the table
In Matthew 26:27 the Lord Jesus took the cup, gave thanks, gave it to the disciples, and said, 'Drink of it, all of you'
The cup is related to the Lord's blood, which has redeemed us from our fallen condition back to God and back to God's full blessing
Concerning the Lord's table , the bread signifies our participation in life, and the cup, our enjoyment of God's blessing
Christ has drunk that cup for us , and His blood has constituted the cup of salvation for us , the cup that runs over
In Matthew 26:28 the Lord goes on to say, 'For this is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins'
The 'fruit of the vine' within the cup of the Lord's table is also a symbol, signifying the Lord's blood shed on the cross for our sins
In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings
The blood is the price Christ paid for us, the covenant is the title deed God made to us, and the cup is the portion we receive from God
In verse 11 the Greek word is psuche, the same word for soul, which means the soulish life, that is, the human life
He laid down His soul life, His human life, to accomplish redemption for His sheep so that they may share His divine life, the eternal life
In order to be our Savior, He, as a man, laid down His human life to accomplish redemption for us so that we may receive the divine life
As the conclusion of His earthly ministry Christ accomplished the great work of replacing all the offerings with Himself
Ephesians 5:2 says that Christ loved us and 'gave Himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savor'
Christ gave Himself up for us both as an offering to have fellowship with God and as a sacrifice to redeem us from sin
Christ gave Himself for us not only that He might redeem us from all lawlessness but also purify to Himself a people for His own possession
The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence
In Ephesians 5:25 we have the church coming into existence through Christ's loving her and giving Himself up for her
Luke 2219 says Having taken a loaf when He had given thanks He broke it and gave it to them saying This is My body which is given for you
Before His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus made the long journey from Galilee to Jerusalem for the purpose of presenting Himself to God
We need to be impressed that Christ's giving Himself for us involves hard work carried out through a long process of suffering
We have seen that during the first three hours of His crucifixion, Christ was persecuted by men for doing God's will
In order for Christ to complete His giving of Himself for us, it was necessary for man to do his part and for God to do His part
As part of His work in His death Christ poured out His blood for the new covenant and for the forgiveness of the believers' sins
The Lord Jesus wanted His disciples to know this and live a life based on it and according to it after His resurrection
In Matthew 26:28 the Lord Jesus says, 'This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for forgiveness of sins'
Without forgiveness of sin there is no way to fulfill the requirement of God's righteousness so that the new covenant may be enacted
Christ's blood was poured out for the forgiveness of sins, and the new covenant has been enacted with His blood
In this new covenant God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation, and all spiritual, heavenly, and divine blessings
In His work Christ poured out His blood so that the new covenant may be enacted and the believers' sins may be forgiven
It may seem that the Roman soldiers took the initiative to pierce the Lord's side to cause His blood to come out
During the last three hours the Lord Jesus was on the cross God put our sins upon Him regarding Him as the unique sinner even as sin itself
With respect to Christ's giving Himself as a ransom for many in payment of our debt, God could not do anything lawlessly
For Christ to pay off our debt it was necessary for Him to pass through a process that went on for three hours
Hebrews 10:12 says, 'This One, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sat down forever on the right hand of God'
Hebrews 9:26 says, 'Now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested for the putting away of sin by His sacrifice'
Christ was foreordained for us before the foundation of the world , and He was slain from the foundation of the world
His being slain took place once for all at the consummation of the ages, when He offered Himself to God for the putting away of sin
The real putting away of sin was accomplished once for all by Christ on the cross when He offered Himself as a sacrifice for sins
His offering of Himself was once for all , and the redemption accomplished through His death is eternal , having an eternal effect
During the last three hours He was on the cross, He was in the sight of God the unique sinner offering Himself as a sin offering
John 2:2 says that Christ is a propitiation concerning our sins, and 4:10 says that God sent His Son a propitiation concerning our sins
The Greek word for 'propitiation' in these verses, hilasmos, means 'that which propitiates,' that is, a propitiatory sacrifice
Christ offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins , not only for our redemption but also for God's satisfaction
In Hebrews 2:17 the Lord Jesus makes propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God's righteous demands on us
By appeasing God's righteousness and all His requirements on us, Christ has settled every problem between us and God
Christ as the Lamb of God is the representation and fulfillment of all the offerings to accomplish God's full redemption
Through Christ as the Lamb of God representing all the offerings we may enter into God and participate in the divine life and nature
According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross God took all our sins and put them upon this Lamb of God
Christ put our sins upon Himself and carried them up onto the tree, the cross, where He suffered God's righteous judgment for all our sins
The life-giving Spirit is working within us continually to carry out the subjective aspect of Christ's cross in our living
Whereas the law condemns us and makes the curse official, Christ through His crucifixion has redeemed us out of the curse of the law
Since thorns are a sign of the curse, Christ's wearing a crown of thorns indicates that He took our curse on the cross
Because Christ was cursed in our place, the demand of the law was fulfilled, and He could redeem us from the curse of the law
Sin came from Satan as the rebel against God , entered into man , and made man not only a sinner but sin itself under God's judgment
When Christ became a man in the flesh , He was made sin on our behalf to be judged by God that we might become God's righteousness in Him
Romans 8:3 says, 'God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh'
According to Romans 8:3, God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin so that God might condemn sin in the flesh
Incarnation refers to one thing which was formerly outside another thing entering into that thing and becoming one with it
He sent Him not in the reality of the flesh of sin but in the likeness, in the appearance, of the flesh of sin
The answer is that God condemned sin in the flesh of Jesus Christ, the One who was sent in the likeness of the flesh of sin
As such a man in the flesh, He had only the likeness of the flesh of sin, not the sinful nature of the flesh of sin
Adam, the head of all mankind, made himself with his descendants a fallen man in God's old creation through his fall
Galatians 6:14 says that through the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ the world has been crucified to us and we to the world
Hebrews 2:9 says clearly that Christ tasted death not only on behalf of every man but also on behalf of everything
In the same principle, He is the last Adam, the head of all mankind, and as such He is qualified to be the Redeemer of mankind
Because the world system is connected to Satan, when he, the ruler of the world, was judged, the world was judged as well
In John 3:14 He said concerning this, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
God told Moses to lift up a brass serpent on their behalf for God's judgment so that by looking upon that brass serpent all may live
They themselves were not judged, but they were judged in and through their representative, which was the serpent made of brass
No doubt, the Lord Jesus was crucified as the brass serpent in order to deal with Satan, the Devil, the old serpent
Christ died not only as the Substitute of fallen men, who had been bitten by the serpent, but also to destroy the Devil
In Hebrews 2:9 we have the profound revelation that Christ tasted death not only for man but also for all other things
The Greek word translated 'nullified' also means make of none effect, bring to naught, do away with, abolish, annul, discard
Although death has not yet been removed, it is none the less a fact that it has been nullified through Christ's death on the cross
Colossians 2:15 says, 'Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it'
The Greek words translated 'in it' refer to the cross, but they can also be rendered 'in Him,' referring to Christ
After God created the heavens, the earth, and billions of items in the universe, an archangel rebelled and many angels followed him
The words 'stripping off' indicate that the rulers and authorities were very close, as close as our garments are to our body
By stripping off the rulers and authorities God made a display of them openly, putting them to shame and triumphing over them
While Christ was working to accomplish redemption, the rulers and authorities came to interfere, pressing in close to Christ
At that very juncture God stripped them off, triumphed over them, and made a display of them openly, putting them to an open shame
Although Christ was crucified for our sins, the goal of His crucifixion was to rescue us out of the present evil age
Apart from the crucifixion of Christ we have no way to deal with sins behind which the Devil hides or the evil age behind which Satan hides
In Galatians 1:4 Paul points out that in order to rescue us from the present evil religious age, Christ gave Himself for our sins
In John 10 we see that Christ as the good Shepherd entered into the fold in order to bring His sheep out of the fold and into the pasture
Eventually Christ came as the Shepherd to bring the sheep out of the fold to the pasture, where they may feed on His riches
In Galatians 1 we see that Christ gave Himself for our sins for the purpose of rescuing us out of religion, out of the present evil age
Through His death on the cross the Lord Jesus gave Himself for our sins in order to rescue us from the religious fold
Due to man's fall, among mankind there are many ordinances, many customs, habits, ways to live, and ways to worship
Not only was there a partition between Jews and Gentiles; there were also partitions between every nationality and race
Without the removal of these partitions, there would not be a way for us to be one in the Lord Jesus as His Body
Christ who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers is Himself our peace our harmony in that He made both one
Because of the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles
The commandments regarding circumcision and the eating regulations were ritual commandments, not moral commandments
Because mankind became flesh and was thus kept from God and His purpose, God ordained His chosen people to be circumcised from the flesh
The ordinances, or decrees, refer to the ceremonial law with its rituals, the forms or ways of living and worship
In His work on the cross the Lord Jesus died as a grain of wheat falling into death for the release of the divine life
He was a grain of wheat, and there was no other way for that grain to increase except to fall into the ground and die
In His death Christ was sown into the earth as a grain of wheat to produce a multiplication through the release of the divine life
In John 12:23 the Lord said, 'The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified,' and in verse 28 He prayed, 'Father, glorify Your name'
The death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus glorified God the Father because Christ's death released the divine element from within Him
In order for the life element of a grain of wheat to be glorified, the grain must die so that the element within it can be released
The redemptive aspect is for the life-releasing aspect, which is even more wonderful than the redemptive aspect
God's purpose is that redemption be followed by the imparting of life, for God's intention is to dispense Himself into us as life
Redemption prepares the way for the release of the divine life so that this life may be dispensed into us for the producing of the church
The dying of this grain of wheat was not for redemption it was for releasing the divine life so that it may be imparted into the many grains
Because His divine life has not only been released out of Him but also imparted into us, His death was a life-imparting death
The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh which He received through incarnation, not in His spirit
Throughout the centuries great teachers of different schools have had varying interpretations concerning the spirits in prison
The word 'proclaimed' does not indicate the preaching of the good news but the proclaiming of the triumphant victory
These are angelic beings, not human beings, and therefore are different from the eight souls also spoken of in verse 20
Although He was put to death in His body, He was enlivened and empowered in His spirit, even before the resurrection
In this enlivened and empowered spirit He went to proclaim to the rebellious angels God's victory over Satan, their leader
Christ's death not only accomplished redemption for us, but also gained the victory over Satan and his followers
The freshness of His resurrection was first for the Father's enjoyment, as the firstfruit of the harvest was, in type, brought first to God
The firstfruits of the harvest were offered to God on the day after the Sabbath, on the first day of the following week
On the first day of the week Christ, the firstfruit of resurrection, resurrected from the dead to offer Himself to God
Exodus 23:19a says, 'The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the Lord thy God'
One aspect of Christ's work in His resurrection was to rise up to be the firstfruit presented to the Father for His satisfaction
Regeneration enlivens us with God's life and brings us into a relationship of life, an organic union, with God
Because of God's choosing, the Spirit's sanctifying, and Christ's redeeming, God has begotten us, has regenerated us
With one who has been regenerated by God with the divine life there is the hope that everything will be enlivened and thus become living
In Adam we all died, but through the instrumentality of Christ's resurrection God has regenerated us, has enlivened us
Now He is the life within us that potentiates the new birth and causes every part of our being to become living
Another aspect of Christ's work in His resurrection is His rising on the first day of the week to germinate the new creation
It is significant that the Lord Jesus was resurrected not on the last day of the week but on the first day of the week
The fact that Christ arose on the first day of the week indicates that the entire universe has a new beginning in Christ's resurrection
Whereas the Lord's death was the termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation
For this reason, instead of keeping the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, we meet on the Lord's Day, the first day of the week
When Christ resurrected to germinate a new creation He left the old creation signified by the linen cloths and the handkerchief in the tomb
All the things which were cast off from the Lord's resurrected body and left in His tomb signify the old creation
He resurrected from within it, leaving it in the tomb and becoming the firstfruit of the new creation in resurrection
We are a new creation , not according to the old nature of flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
The old creation does not have God in it, but the new creation begins by God coming into us in the way of germination
Germination is the impartation of the divine life into the believers for their regeneration to make them a new creation
As a grain of wheat He had a human 'shell,' by which He was restricted and under which His divine element was covered and concealed
When He died, the divine life was released from within the shell of His humanity to produce many grains in His resurrection
In this way the life within the seed is released to bring forth much fruit, and this fruit-bearing is glorification
The Lord Jesus was glorified by dying as a grain of wheat and then growing up in resurrection to produce many grains
In John 13:31 and 32 the Lord Jesus spoke again concerning His glorification: 'Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him
After speaking the words recorded in John 13:31 and 32, the Lord Jesus went on to give the lengthy message recorded in John 14 through 16
Both the Lord's message in chapters fourteen through sixteen and His prayer in chapter seventeen are on the subject of glorification
In John 17:1 the Lord Jesus prayed, 'Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You'
His divine element was confined in His humanity, just as God's shekinah glory was concealed within the tabernacle
Once, on the mountain of transfiguration, His divine element was released from within His flesh and expressed in glory
Before the prayer recorded in John 17, the Lord indicated that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him
He would also resurrect so that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed
Before His incarnation Christ as the only begotten Son of God was with the Father in glory and enjoyed this glory with the Father
His humanity was a shell that covered and confined the divine life and nature, along with the divine glory, that were within Him
The divine glory, the expression of the divine life and nature, was therefore confined and concealed within the Lord's humanity
According to Acts 13:33, the Lord Jesus was begotten in resurrection to be the Son of God with respect to His humanity
We may wonder why it was necessary for Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God, to be born in resurrection as the Son of God
Christ's being the firstborn Son of God implies that He has many brothers and that He is the Firstborn among these brothers
According to God's view, the divine view, all His chosen people were born together with Christ in His resurrection
All the believers, including the early apostles and those who will be the last to believe in the Lord Jesus, were regenerated together
The Head is the firstborn Son of God, and the Body is a composition of all the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Lord
The body of Jesus that was destroyed on the cross was small and weak; the Body of Christ in resurrection is vast and powerful
What was raised up by the Lord in resurrection was not only His own body but everyone who is joined to Him by faith
By this we see that, in one sense, the resurrection of Christ was a birth and, in another sense, it was a rebuilding
Now He is the Spirit who gives life, the Spirit who imparts life to us, the Spirit who dispenses Himself as life into the believers
He was Christ in the flesh, but He has been transfigured into the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the life-giving Spirit
Christs resurrection is a matter absolutely related to life for in resurrection He became the lifegiving Spirit the Spirit who imparts life
The highest definition of resurrection is that it is the process by which Christ, the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit
Christ's resurrection was His transfiguration-the transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit to enter into His believers
All these elements have been brought into the all- inclusive life-giving Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God
The Holy Spirit is the realization of the resurrected Christ, and the Lord breathed this realization into the disciples
The Gospel of John clearly reveals that Christ became flesh to be the Lamb of God and that in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit
The Holy Spirit in John 20:22 is the Spirit expected in 7:39 and promised in 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; and 16:7-8, 13
Christ's presenting Himself alive was for the purpose of training the disciples to practice and enjoy His invisible presence
In the Gospel of John there is no word or hint indicating that the Lord Jesus left the disciples after breathing Himself into them
From the time He breathed Himself as the Spirit into the disciples on the day of His resurrection, the resurrected Christ dwelt in them
Rather, it means that He made His presence visible to them, training them to realize and enjoy continually His invisible presence
When the Lord Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil, He fasted forty days and forty nights
In Acts 1 the Lord Jesus appeared and disappeared during a period of forty days in order to train His disciples
It is not likely that during the forty days after His resurrection He gave the disciples something new concerning the kingdom
When the Lord spoke regarding the kingdom in the Gospels, the disciples were not able to understand what He was teaching them
As a result, in Acts 1 they were very different, for Christ, the life-giving Spirit, was now within them as their life and person
Because they had the life-giving Spirit within them, they were able to understand Christ's speaking concerning the kingdom of God
The kingdom of God is actually the spreading of Christ as life into His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life
In Acts 1:3 the Lord Jesus must have helped the disciples to have such a proper realization concerning the kingdom of God
Christ's teaching the things concerning the kingdom of God was an important aspect of His work in His resurrection
The Law of Moses, the Prophets, and Psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament, that is, all the Scriptures
The Lord's word here unveils that the entire Old Testament was a revelation of Him and that He was its center and content
Christ's meeting with the disciples in Luke 24 was the right time for Him to commission them to preach the forgiveness of sins
According to the following books of the New Testament, the forgiveness of sins ushers the forgiven ones into the riches of the Triune God
The Gospel of John emphasizes life for fruit-bearing , whereas the Gospel of Luke stresses forgiveness of sins for proclaiming
To proclaim forgiveness of sins requires economically the Spirit of power received through the baptism in the Spirit
In Mark 16:15 the Lord Jesus said to His disciples, 'Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation'
All things, whether on earth or in the heavens, were reconciled to God, and the gospel should be proclaimed to all creation under heaven
Based upon this, all the creation expects to be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
In Matthew 28:18 the resurrected Christ spoke to His disciples saying, 'All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth'
Because all authority had been given to Him, the Lord Jesus sent His disciples to go and disciple all the nations
Notice that the Lord Jesus did not charge the disciples merely to preach the gospel but to disciple the nations
In verse 19 the Lord speaks of baptizing the nations into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
The visible aspect is the expression the testimony of the invisible aspect whereas the invisible aspect is the reality of the visible aspect
The water, signifying the death of Christ with His burial, may be considered a tomb to terminate the history of the baptized ones
The baptism ordained by the Lord Jesus here is to baptize people out of their life into the Body life for the kingdom of the heavens
The word 'height' in the quotation from Psalm 68:18 refers to Mount Zion , symbolizing the third heaven where God dwells
Psalm 68 implies that it was in the ark that God ascended to Mount Zion after the ark had led the way to victory
In His ascension Christ led them captive; that is, He rescued them from Satan's captivity and took them to Himself
The Amplified New Testament renders 'He led a train of vanquished foes' for 'He led captive those taken captive'
Vanquished foes' may refer to Satan, to his angels, and to us the sinners, also indicating Christ's victory over Satan, sin, and death
In His ascension there was a procession of these vanquished foes as captives from a war for a celebration of Christ's victory
God not only raised us up from the position of death but also seated us in the heavenlies, in the highest place in the universe
The word 'heavenlies' refers not only to a place but also to an atmosphere with a certain nature and characteristic
God's salvation has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic
He brought us to the heavens where we are now sitting, not as captives but as sons of God and members of Christ
When the victorious Christ ascended, He led a train of vanquished foes and constituted them into gifts to His Body
Because Christ is the Head over all things to the church, He is able to make gifts and to present them to the church
Because all that Christ is and has is transmitted to the church, He is able to constitute us as gifts to the Body
The believers are not only materials for the building up of the church; they are also gifts who build up the church
Psalm 68:18, prophesying of Christ, says, 'Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men'
When Paul wrote the book of Ephesians, he was under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, and the revealing Spirit is not bound
Paul took Psalm 68 as the basis for telling us that after His ascension Christ, the Head, gave gifts to the church
They were to wait in Jerusalem until the ascended Christ poured out upon them the promise of the Father the promise of the economical Spirit
The sending forth of the Holy Spirit upon the believers, accomplished by the Lord in His heavenly ministry, was economical
The Spirit in John 20:22 is the Spirit expected in John 7:39 and promised in John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-8, 13
The Lord's breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise of the Holy Spirit as the Comforter
By breathing the Spirit into the disciples, the resurrected Christ imparted Himself as life and everything to them essentially
The former as the water of life requires our drinking ; the latter as the water for baptism requires our being immersed
In receiving the Spirit essentially and economically the believers followed the pattern set up by the Lord Jesus
When He began His ministry at the age of thirty, the same Holy Spirit who was the essence of His being came upon Him economically
After Christ's ascension the same Spirit was poured out upon us economically that we may work to carry out God's economy
The sending forth of the Holy Spirit upon the believers economically was an important aspect of Christ's work in His heavenly ministry
In His heavenly ministry Christ is the Lord, exercising His sovereignty over all for the accomplishment of the divine economy
In His heavenly ministry Christ as Gods Anointed is doing a work to carry out Gods commission to Him concerning the New Testament economy
As the Head over all things to the church, He makes all things work together for the producing and building up of the church
Through the growth of life we shall arrive at a full-grown man and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
It is of great significance that Ephesians 4:15 speaks not of growing into the Savior or into the Lord but into the Head
As the members of the Body are perfected through the ministry of Christ, they will grow up into Him in particular matters
Both the joints of the supply and every single part with its measure are needed for the church to build itself up
It is through these multiplied believers and gifted members that the church has been built up under His heavenly ministry
In His heavenly ministry Christ is also doing the work of sanctifying, cleansing, nourishing, and cherishing the church
To be sanctified is not only to be separated from what is common but also to be saturated with the element of Christ
Christ's work of sanctifying the church is accomplished by cleansing her with the washing of the water in the Word
According to the divine concept, the water in Ephesians 5:26 refers to the flowing life of God typified by flowing water
In sanctifying the church, the Lord first washes away our sins with His blood and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life
All the spots and wrinkles in the church will be washed away through the inner cleansing of the water in the Word
Through Christ's work of nourishing the church we are transformed; we become new persons with a new element and substance
As a mother cherishes a child by holding the child close to her breast, the Lord Jesus cherishes us by holding us close to Him
As the surety of a better covenant, Christ in His heavenly ministry guarantees and ensures the effectiveness of the new testament
The word surety in Hebrews 7:22 indicates that Christ has pledged Himself to the new covenant and to all of us
He is the bondsman, the guarantee, that He will do everything necessary for the fulfillment of the new covenant
Everything included in the new testament will be fulfilled not by us but by Christ in His work as the surety of a better covenant
Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge, that everything in it will be fulfilled
Sometimes as we read the Bible we may have doubts concerning certain items that are bequests in the new testament
Because of Christ's work in His heavenly ministry as our surety we should not have doubts regarding anything in the new testament
On the other hand, as our surety Christ is guaranteeing and ensuring everything that is included in the new testament
The Greek word translated 'with' is pros, with the accusative, a preposition of motion, implying living, acting, in union and communion with
John's use of Father as the divine title here indicates that our case is a family affair, a case between children and the Father
John 2:2 goes on to say, 'And He is a propitiation concerning our sins, and not concerning ours only, but also concerning the whole world'
Our Paraclete, who shed His blood for the cleansing of our sins , is our propitiation, a word that indicates appeasing or peacemaking
The Lord Jesus offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for our sins , not only for our redemption but also for God's satisfaction
In His work in His heavenly ministry, Christ is also our High Priest, according to the order of Melchisedec, interceding for us
Christ has been constituted our High Priest according to the power of an indestructible life , which nothing can dissolve
It is an endless life being the eternal divine uncreated life and the resurrection life that has passed through the test of death and Hades
It is by such a life that Christ ministers today as our High Priest with an unalterable priesthood, a priesthood that, like Him, is forever
The word translated 'uttermost' also means completely, entirely, perfectly, for all time and eternity and to the end
Because Christ lives forever without change, He is able to save us to the uttermost in extent, time, and space
He appears before God on our behalf, praying that we may be wholly saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
Hebrews 7:26 goes on to say, 'Such a High Priest befits us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners'
In His ascension Christ 'has passed through the heavens' , and now He is not only in heaven but is also higher than the heavens
Because our High Priest is higher than the heavens, He is able, in His heavenly ministry, to rescue us and save us to the uttermost
Facts refer to certain things that have been accomplished but which are not yet designated until they are bequeathed
As the Ruler of the kings of the earth, Christ rules the whole earth that the gospel may be spread and the church may be produced
Now we need to do our part by being faithful to Him so that He may use us to spread the gospel and build up the church
In the divine administration Christ is also the High Priest, judging and purifying the churches and holding the messengers of the churches
Christ's feet being like shining brass indicates that His perfect and bright walk qualifies Him to exercise divine judgment
Revelation 1:16, 20 and 2:1 indicate that, as the High Priest, Christ is holding the messengers of the churches
The messengers of the churches are the spiritual ones in the churches bearing the responsibility of the testimony of Jesus
Revelation 212 says that Christ has the sharp twoedged sword and 218 that He has eyes as a flame of fire and His feet like shining brass
In dealing with the church in Pergamos, the worldly church, Christ refers to Himself as the One who has the sharp two-edged sword
He is also holding the responsible ones, the faithful ones, who are bearing the burden of His testimony on earth
We trust in Him and look to Him for His continued purifying and holding so that we all may go on in a pure way
In the divine administration Christ, as the Lion-Lamb, the overcoming Redeemer, opens the scroll of God's economy
These seven seals are the contents of the scroll, and the scroll itself is the new covenant, enacted with the blood of the Lamb
Because He has solved these problems for God, He is worthy to open the scroll of God's economy and its seven seals
The white horse with its rider is a symbol of the preaching of the gospel which is clean, pure, just, and approvable both to men and to God
The opening of the fifth seal discloses Christian martyrdom from the first century to the time near the end of this age
Whereas the first four seals of the scroll of God's economy are simultaneous, the fifth and sixth seals are consecutive
Revelation 8:1 says that when the Lion-Lamb 'opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour'
With the opening of the seventh seal the age of toleration is terminated, and another age is brought in-the age of God's wrath
We do not know what kind of seal this will be, but it will be a mark recognizable to the angels sent to judge the earth
The pillars indicate steadfastness and fire signifies the holiness of God according to which Christ will execute His judgment upon the earth
The little opened scroll is the scroll in 5:1, the scroll of God's economy, which only Christ is worthy to open
In His coming Christ will eventually shine over the whole earth to destroy Babylon the Great with great authority
The fall of Babylon pronounced in verse 2 is the fall of material Babylon, which will take place at the end of the great tribulation
We see Christ as the One leading His army to fight Antichrist and the kings under him and their armies at Armageddon
The first thing the Lord Jesus will do in His coming back will be to bring the firstfruit into His presence, into His parousia
We do not know whether the reaping of the firstfruit and the rapture of the overcomers will be one matter or two separate matters
Concerning two men in the field and two women grinding at the mill, we are told that 'one is taken, and one is left'
The householder here refers to the believer, and the house, to the believer's conduct and work that he has built up in his Christian life
Matthew 24:44 concludes, 'Therefore, you also, be ready, for the Son of Man comes in an hour that you think not'
To escape all these things is to be taken raptured before the great tribulation which will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth
The Lord promises the recovered church that He will keep her out of the hour of trial, not only out of the trial
After the firstfruit is reaped and the overcomers are taken up, during the tribulation Christ will descend with them to the air
The catching up of the majority of the believers in clouds is the reaping of the harvest in Revelation 14:14-16
All the believers since that time who have received Him as the seed of life have become the crop of God on earth
Christ's judgment of believers at His coming back will not be concerning their eternal salvation but their dispensational reward
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
The righteousness we receive for salvation is objective so that we may meet the requirement of the righteous God
The righteousnesses of the overcoming saints are subjective so that they may meet the requirements of the overcoming Christ
After being dealt with by the Lord in the kingdom age, they will participate in the New Jerusalem for eternity
Those who are regarded as goats will go with their leader, Antichrist, 'into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his angels'
On earth today there are three categories of people: the believers who comprise the church, Israel as God's chosen people, and the Gentiles
The millennium will be the last section of Gods kingdom on this earth in the old creation over the Godcreated fallen and restored nations
After the millennium Christ will do the work of judging all the dead, for He is the Judge of both the living and the dead
In the first death the soul and the spirit are separated from the body and perish in the suffering section of Hades
In the second death the soul and the spirit, after being rejoined to the body in resurrection, are cast with the body into the lake of fire
Revelation 20:15 concludes, 'If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire'
According to the context of this portion of the Word, the throne of God and of the Lamb is the center of the New Jerusalem
In the New Jerusalem the throne of the redeeming God will be in the center of the city, and His expression will extend to its circumference
The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it, and its lamp is the Lamb
The Lamb as the lamp will shine with God as the light to illumine the city with the glory of God, the expression of the divine light
Because such a divine light will illumine the holy city, it will not have need of any other light, whether created by God or made by man
In the millennium the light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun will be intensified sevenfold
Christ will shine with God as light, and this shining will be brighter than that of either the moon or the sun
For eternity in the new heaven and the new earth, all God's redeemed will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion
Christ as the tree of life, as the life supply, will be available along the flow of the Spirit as the water of life
