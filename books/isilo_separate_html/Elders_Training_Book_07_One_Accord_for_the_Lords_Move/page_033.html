<p>What should we do? Everyone who would take this new way must be a full-timer. Full-timers are of two kinds&mdash; job-dropping full-timers and money-making full-timers. All must be full-timers. Either you drop your job to preach, to teach, to visit people, and to work for the church full-time, or you remain in your job to make money for the Lord&rsquo;s move. Even if you earned two million dollars a year, you should not spend more than what is required for the need of your actual living. Suppose that you and your family only need two thousand five hundred dollars a month or thirty thousand dollars a year for your proper, actual living expenses. Then you should only spend that much and give the rest to the Lord&rsquo;s move. This is not a regulation and no one would regulate you. With your pure conscience and the indwelling Spirit you should regulate yourself to be a money-making full-timer. Even a mother of six children has to be a full-timer. She must do her best to help her husband, to take care of the family, to make more money, and to spend every cent besides the needs of her family for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONE ACCORD BROUGHT INTO BEING<br />
UNDER THE ONE LEADERSHIP<br />
BASED UPON THE UNIQUE TEACHING,<br />
THE DIVINE REVELATION</h2>
<p>All those who take this call to be full-timers have to learn how to be in one accord. This one accord could only come into being under the one leadership, and the one, unique leadership is altogether based upon the unique teaching, the divine revelation. We must admit according to the biblical truth that God is one, the Lord is one, the Spirit is one, and Christ&rsquo;s Body is one, which means the church is one universally and the testimony is one. Also, the work of the Lord is one, the teaching is one, and the leadership is one. Based upon all these &ldquo;ones,&rdquo; we surely have the one accord.</p>
<p>Whoever feels burdened and willing to take this new way&mdash;let us go on together. I want to stir up myself, and I want to stir up all of you. Wake up! Sleepers, rise up (Eph. 5:14)! Let us go the way of ones&mdash;one God, one Lord, one Spirit, one Christ, one Body, one church, one testimony, one work, one teaching, one leadership, and then one accord. Do not push others to go this way. Just go this way according to your burden by yourself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD OF LOVE, ADVICE, AND WARNING</h2>
<p>I am prepared to meet a situation in which some in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will not go this way. This will not surprise me. You and I should not consider these ones as strangers and should not cut them off from the recovery. We should still love them, respect them, and not despise them a bit. Do not consider them as another kind of people. Although they have not joined the army, they are still proper citizens.</p>
<p>To those who would not take this way, I would give a word of love, advice, and warning. Do not criticize, do not attack, and do not oppose. If you do, you will suffer the loss. This would mean that you would betray the recovery. You would become a betrayer, a traitor. Some may feel that they are not betrayers or traitors but protectors. According to their concept, they do not want to see that I am the unique leader to control the entire recovery. This is a very good cloak for them to put on. I have been with the recovery for fifty-five years, since 1932. In all these years I have not controlled anyone. I do not have the intention to control anybody or to exercise any control. But we need a proper leadership.</p>
<p>If anyone of you could rise up to render the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the proper leadership, I would be the first to follow you, to take your leadership. But what kind of direction can you give us? How much truth do you know? Could you open up the entire New Testament from Matthew to Revelation in a detailed way to bring the churches into the depths of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy? If I am boasting, I am forced to be a fool like the Apostle Paul (2 Cor. 12:11).</p>
<p>There is no hint in the New Testament telling us that in the Lord&rsquo;s move there could or should be more than one leadership. No one can deny this truth. Even the Devil, Satan, has to admit that two plus two is four. If you are going to express your opinion, you must annul the truth I put out. Do not express your opinion; express your knowledge of the truth. We all need to take the revelation in the holy Word and according to the pure Word. Do not twist the Word but cut straight the word of the truth (2 Tim. 2:15). Paul charged Timothy to cut the word as a carpenter in carpentry. Do not cut the Word in a crooked way with some biases. Do not fight, oppose, attack, or criticize anything which is according to the divine truth. You must first go to the Word. You also must study a person&rsquo;s background, his history, his doings, and his teachings to discern his qualifications for taking the lead. My point is this&mdash;since the revelation is here, the teaching is here, the leadership must be here. But the tragedy among today&rsquo;s Christians is that they only like to take the teaching not the leadership. Sometimes they even would give up the teaching.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> </body></html>
