   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Word of God makes it clear that the oversight of a church is not the work of apostles, but of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although Paul stayed in Corinth for over a year, in Rome for two years, and in Ephesus for three years, yet in none of these places did he assume responsibility for the work of the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Scripture we read of the elders of Ephesus, but never of the apostles of Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We find no mention made of the apostles of Philippi, but we do find reference to the bishops of Philippi.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Apostles are responsible for their own particular ministry, but not for the churches which are the fruit of their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the fruit of the apostles' work had to be handed over to the care of local elders.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In God's plan provision has been made for the building up of local churches, and in that plan pastors have a place, but it was never His thought that apostles should assume the role of pastors.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He purposed that apostles should be responsible for the work in different places, while elders were to bear responsibility in one place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The characteristic of an apostle is going; the characteristic of an elder is staying.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not necessary that elders resign their ordinary professions and devote themselves exclusively to their duties in connection with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They are simply local men, following their usual pursuits and at the same time bearing special responsibilities in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Should local affairs increase, they may devote themselves entirely to spiritual work, but the characteristic of an elder is not that he is a "full-time Christian worker."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is merely that, as a local brother, he bears responsibility in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Locality determines the boundary of a church, and it is for that reason that the elders are always chosen from among the more mature believers in any place, and not transferred from other places.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, the local character of the churches of God is preserved, and consequently also their independent government and spiritual unity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the usual conception of things, one would think it necessary for a considerable time to elapse between the founding of a church and the appointment of elders, but that is not according to God's pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first missionary tour of the apostles covered less than two years, and during that period the apostles preached the gospel, led sinners to the Lord, formed churches, and appointed elders wherever a church had been formed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The elders were chosen on the apostles' return journey, not on their first visit to any place; but the interval between their two visits was never long, at the most a matter of months.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On their return journey the apostles would naturally find some places progressing more favorably than others, but they did not reason that, because of the low state of any church, they would make an exception and appoint no elders.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They appointed elders in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some may ask, If all the members of a church are in a low spiritual condition, how is it possible to appoint elders among them?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It may solve the problem of many if they only consider the implication of the term "elder."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The existence of an elder implies the existence of a junior.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The word "elder" is relative, not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Among a group of men in their seventy-ninth year it takes a man in his eightieth year to be their elder; but it only takes a child of eight to be "elder" to a company of children of seven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even among the spiritually immature there are bound to be those who, in comparison with the others, are more mature and have spiritual possibilities, which is all the qualification they require to be their elders.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A church may come far short of the ideal, but we cannot on that account deprive it of the status of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our responsibility is to minister to it and so seek to bring it nearer the ideal.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, even the comparatively advanced ones in a locality may not reach the ideal of elders, but we cannot for that reason deprive them of the status of elders.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In comparison with the elders of other places they may seem very immature, but if they are more advanced than the other believers in the same locality, then in their own church they are elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must remember that the office of an elder according to Scripture is limited to a locality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Being an elder in Nanking does not qualify a man to be an elder in Shanghai; but even if his spiritual state is far from what it should be, provided he is in advance of his fellow believers in the same church, then he is qualified to be an elder there.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You can only have pattern elders where you have a pattern church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where a church is immature, the elders will naturally be immature; where a church is mature, the elders will also be mature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The model elders of 1 Timothy 3 and of Titus 1 are to be found in model churches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The appointing of comparatively spiritual brothers to be elders is a principle set forth in the Word of God, though it runs counter to the modern conception of things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But even while we recognize this principle, we must not seek to apply it in any legal way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>That would spell death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must force nothing, but must be continually open to the leading of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will indicate the right time for the appointment of elders in any church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Should there be no leading of the Holy Spirit, and circumstances not permit an immediate appointment of elders on the second visit of the apostles, then a Titus could be left behind to see to their appointment later.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the first subject dealt with in the book of Titus, and it is a most important one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul gives Titus injunctions to establish elders in every city in Crete Titus 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the appointment of elders the apostles did not follow their personal preferences; they only appointed those whom God had already chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That is why Paul could say to the elders in Ephesus, "The Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers" Acts 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The apostles did not take the initiative in the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They merely established as elders those whom the Holy Spirit had already made overseers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In a man-made organization the appointment of an individual to office entitles him to occupy that office; but not so in the Church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Everything there is on a spiritual basis, and it is only divine appointment that qualifies a man for office.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the Holy Spirit does not make men bishops, then no apostolic appointment will ever avail to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Church of God everything is under the sovereignty of the Spirit; man is ruled out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Elders are not men who think themselves capable to control church affairs, or men whom the apostles consider suitable, but men whom the Holy Spirit has set to be overseers in the Church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Those whom the Spirit chooses to be shepherds of the flock, to them He also gives grace and gifts to qualify them for spiritual leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is their spiritual call and their spiritual equipment, not their official appointment, that constitutes them elders.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In a spiritual sense they are already elders before they hold the position officially, and it is because they actually are elders that they are publicly appointed to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the early Church it was the Holy Spirit who first signified His choice of elders; then the apostles confirmed the choice by appointing them to office.</S>
