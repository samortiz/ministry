<h1 class="title">LIVING THE BODY LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:4; 12:4-5</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY LIFE ISSUING FROM<br />
WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ in Romans 12 issues from the experience of walking according to the spirit in Romans 8. According to Paul&rsquo;s view of God&rsquo;s economy, all the members of the Body of Christ should be persons who walk according to the spirit. In principle, if we do not walk according to the spirit, we cannot practically have the Body of Christ. All the believers are members of the Body of Christ, but the practicality of the Body depends on the believers&rsquo; walk. If the believers walk according to the flesh, although they are still members of the Body of Christ, there will be no Body in their experience. The Body life is annulled by a fleshly walk. There are millions of believers today, but there is very little of the Body life among them, because few walk according to the spirit. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the situation in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is somewhat better, yet we have to admit that even among us the Body life is lacking. We may have living meetings and stand on the proper ground of oneness, but the Body life among us is inadequate.</p>
<p>The Body life does not depend on the exercise of the spirit in the meetings but on the walk, the daily living, of the saints. The exercise of the spirit to sing, pray, and speak in the meetings helps the saints to live the Body life, but we need to realize that these things themselves are not the Body life. It is wrong to think that if we have a high meeting, we have the Body life. I have participated in many high meetings. During a revival in the church in Chefoo, the meetings were full of the Spirit. In some of the meetings the Spirit caused all the attendees to spontaneously weep. An older brother who visited those meetings was a director of the college where I had studied and a founder of an independent Chinese denomination. He had visited our meetings before but had not come out of the denominations. However, his children were in the church in Chefoo and strongly encouraged him to come and see what was happening when the revival began. After some time, he came. There were a few hundred saints in the first meeting that he attended, and all were spontaneously weeping. This older brother later testified that when he entered the meeting, he immediately began to weep. He could not control his tears. Afterward, he came the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in spite of the discouragement from his Christian friends, who were leaders in the denominations. Eventually, he became an elder of the church in Hong Kong. The meetings during the revival in Chefoo were so powerful that anyone who entered could not resist the Spirit, but that was not the Body life. The Body life comes from walking according to the spirit.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the revival in Chefoo was of the Lord, yet a revival is not the Body life. Revival is something temporary, but the Body life is lasting. A great revival began in Wales in 1904 through the ministry of Evan Roberts. That revival affected all of Wales, but it soon ended. This again shows that revival is not the Body life. What the Lord wants today is not to start a revival but to recover the Body life, the realization and living of the Body of Christ. In the revival in Chefoo all the saints&mdash;about eight hundred brothers and sisters&mdash;consecrated themselves, their families, and their possessions. They physically brought their belongings to the meeting hall, including the title deeds to their houses, to offer to the church. During that time we had everything in common. However, of those eight hundred saints, perhaps half have left the way of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Only those who walked according to the spirit remained in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>As elders, we must see that our work should be to take the lead to walk according to the spirit and to minister such a life to the saints whom we serve. If this is not our work, whatever we do will be in vain. I have never before or since seen a revival like the one in Chefoo. There were meetings every day for a hundred days, and every meeting was living and high. All eight hundred saints did not care for anything else. They had only one desire&mdash;to be prepared to be sent out as the army of the Lord. Afterward, for the sake of the gospel seventy migrated by boat to Inner Mongolia, and thirty migrated by boat to Andong in southern Manchuria. In spite of that great revival, only those who walked according to the spirit remained in the church life. Some even went back to the world. Therefore, the work of revival is altogether not trustworthy. I have learned this lesson.</p>
<p>I do not trust in any kind of revival work or in the release of the spirit in the meetings. This does not mean that I do not appreciate these things. I like to see the saints releasing their spirits, but I do not trust in it. In 1968 four couples in a certain church wanted to begin practicing pray-reading in the meetings, but the rest of the church opposed it. I encouraged the four couples not to insist on pray-reading in the meetings but to practice it at home. Today two of the couples are still in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and two have left. Practices such as pray-reading, calling on the name of the Lord, singing, and praising are helpful, and revival helps as well. However, we should not trust in these things. Many who have released their spirits strongly in the meetings have not remained in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Only those who have begun to walk according to the spirit have remained. We should not oppose any kind of release of the spirit, but neither do we need to emphasize these things. They help the saints, but in order to live the Body life, the saints must begin to walk according to the spirit. The release of the spirit in the meetings does not have the same spiritual value and weight as walking according to the spirit. If the goal of our work is merely to stir up the saints to release their spirits in the meetings, our work will be in vain. The condition of the meetings is like the weather, constantly changing. I have no trust in outward practices in the meetings. Whether a brother will be an elder should not be determined primarily by his exercise in the meetings. We do not trust in this. In some places we need revival, but we should not trust in that. Revival should usher the saints into walking according to the spirit. Romans 8 and 12 reveal that only such a walk will bring us into the practicality of the Body of Christ.</p>
