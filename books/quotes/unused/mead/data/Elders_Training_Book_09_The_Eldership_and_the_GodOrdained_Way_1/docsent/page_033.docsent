   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BURDEN TO STAY IN ONE PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DIRECTLY HELP BUILD UP A LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have a burden to stay in one place for at least nine months out of the year in order to directly help build up the local church there with some elders.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1922 Brother Nee raised up a local church in his city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Sixty-six years have passed and we have not seen a model of a local church built up entirely according to what we have seen from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Nee did not have the time to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Until now I have not had the time to do this either.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After leaving mainland China, I was in Taiwan for about ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But I spent most of my time to train the saints, and I spent more than one-third of my time in other countries.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We trained many new believers who were saved through our preaching of the gospel when we came to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many brothers who were saved through our preaching became elders.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We trained them and built them up.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then many of them became useful ones to bear responsibility in the church or in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some brothers who are now elders in Taiwan are the sons of these useful ones that were raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because I was so busy training the saints, I did not have the opportunity to build up a local church according to what I teach and according to what I have seen of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many brothers came to me asking for certain ways to do things, but I did not give them a way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I told them to bring this matter to the Lord in prayer and seek the Lord's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I did this because I learned a lot in my earlier ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In my earlier ministry, I could give people many instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, I discovered that very few of these instructions worked well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can illustrate this by the teaching of driving a car.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A driving teacher can impart the principles of driving to his students and even some details, but his teaching is not the application.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the driving teacher actually drives the car, his driving may be absolutely different from what he taught.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He only taught some principles with some details.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But quite often these principles do not fit in with the real situation of the road.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When he taught driving, he did not realize there would be a big dip on a certain road.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not anticipate that the roads would be flooded due to heavy rains.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He never dreamed that two cars would crash right in front of his car.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some of the brothers may say, "I drive according to Brother Lee's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Lee told me this."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But Brother Lee never spoke about "two cars crashing in front of you."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My point is this if the steering wheel of the church were in my hand, I might drive it absolutely different from what I taught you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This driving would be according to the present situation and condition of the church in order to bring the church safely to its destination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thus far, according to my observation, many of the leading ones are still building up the local churches in a "probing way."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They heard something and they received some teaching, but in their practice they are not so clear what to do or how to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why I have the burden to be involved in the direct building of a local church in a certain place if the Lord would give me time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I must be before the Lord as to whether or not I should do this and where I should do this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Please pray for me concerning this matter.</S>
