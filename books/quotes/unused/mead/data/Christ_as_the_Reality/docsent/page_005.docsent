   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Note: In order to be more accurate according to the original language, changes should be made in the above verses.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Change all the instances of "bring" to the verb "present" except in Leviticus 1:15; "the priest shall bring it unto the altar."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Also change "offer" to "present."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The word "offerings" should be changed to the noun "present," except when it reads "burnt offering."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Also in the phrase "an offering by fire," it should remain as "offering."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"Burnt sacrifice" should also be changed to "burnt offering."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have seen two things whereby God meets us and we meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is by the tabernacle that God comes to meet us, and it is by the offerings that we can meet God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is Christ coming and going.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God is in the heavens, and we are on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can God come to us?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Praise the Lord, it is through Christ being the tabernacle!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And how can we go to God?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is by Christ being all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Exodus shows us a tabernacle on the earth, and this tabernacle is of three parts.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is the outer court, which has a white linen fence enclosing the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then within the outer court, there is the tabernacle which is divided into two parts: the holy place, which is the outer part and the Holy of Holies, which is the inner part.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Within the Holy of Holies, there is the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These three parts comprise the tent of meeting, which is Christ enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ Himself is the ark individually, and when He is enlarged, He becomes the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This signifies the church; so it is called the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the tabernacle is erected, God is no more just the God in the heavens, but the very God on the earth among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ as the tabernacle has brought God down to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is now in the tent of meeting, in the midst of us, through Christ the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God is here, but how may we contact Him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is on the earth among the people, but look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are so sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How can we contact God?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the reason for the fence in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The white linen fence signifies the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God is righteous, and His righteousness is an enclosing fence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we would contact this very God who is now on the earth among His people, we need to pass through this fence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In other words, we must meet the requirements of this fence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The righteousness of God is a kind of requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Can we meet the righteous requirement of God?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In ourselves, we are nothing but sin and unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are not qualified to meet the requirement of God's righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But praise the Lord, we have Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ is God's righteousness; so He is qualified to meet the requirement on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Within the tabernacle, on nearly every side, there is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the boards on each of the four sides are overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is a golden place.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Gold signifies God's nature, which is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not only is the righteousness of God a requirement, but also His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we would meet with God, we must meet the requirement of His holiness as well as His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In addition, on the ceiling at the top of the tabernacle there are the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The cherubim in typology signify God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, there is another requirement, the requirement of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we would meet with God, we must meet these three divine requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is the requirement of divine righteousness, divine holiness, and divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God is now on the earth in the tabernacle, but do not think that He is on the earth in a careless way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is enclosed by His righteousness and holiness, and He is also covered by His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is the separating line of white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the first enclosure of the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God's righteousness is a separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It separates unrighteousness from righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The second enclosure is made of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Linen is the first boundary, and gold is the second.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Righteousness is the first requirement, and holiness is the second.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God is enclosed within these two requirements, and He is covered by His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we would enter the Holy of Holies to meet this righteous, holy, and glorious God, we need to meet all His requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do you think that you can make it?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you have the righteousness, the holiness, and the glory?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need Christ not only as the tabernacle, but also as the offerings.</S>
