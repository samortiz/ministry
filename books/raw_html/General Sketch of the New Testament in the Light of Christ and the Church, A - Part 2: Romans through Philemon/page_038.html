<h2 class=head2>Being a Slave as a Child-Conductor</h2><p>The law is no longer the most important item. Galatians 3:24 says that the law is our child-conductor unto Christ. The King James Version mistakenly translates this word as schoolmaster. Strictly speaking, the law is not a schoolmaster but a child-conductor. Conybeare tells us that in the ancient times there was not the system of schooling that we have today. At that time there were schoolmasters, to whose houses parents would send their young children. The more wealthy people at that time had slaves, so when parents sent their children to the schoolmaster’s home to study, a slave would accompany them. Since the children were young, they could get lost travelling from their parent’s home to the schoolmaster, so they needed the slave to care for them.<p>Certain versions of the Bible mistakenly cause people to understand that the law is the schoolmaster. The law is not the schoolmaster; the schoolmaster is Christ, and the law is the child-conductor. God’s intention is to bring us to Christ. However, just as parents used slaves to bring young, immature children to a schoolmaster, God used the law as a child-conductor to bring His people to Christ, the schoolmaster. Because children are young, foolish, and childish, they need a child-conductor. However, when they grow up, there is no need of a child-conductor. Hence, according to the context of Galatians 3, the position of the law is the position of a slave.<h2 class=head2>Being a Maidservant</h2><p>Galatians 4:21-31 shows us something more concerning the position of the law. Abraham had two wives. Sarah is a type of God’s grace, while Abraham’s maidservant, Hagar, typifies the law. The position of the law is the position of a maidservant, or concubine. Therefore, the position of the law is not positive. None of us would want to be the child of a concubine.<p>For this reason we know that the law is not something according to God’s final goal. The law helped toward the goal, but it does not belong to God’s ultimate purpose. Galatians 3:19 tells us that the law “was added because of the transgressions,” but it was not something originally intended by God. The law was not part of God’s original purpose, and it is not a part of His ultimate purpose, His ultimate consummation. Rather, it was added on the way. During the process of fulfilling God’s eternal purpose, something happened, so the law was added to correct and adjust the situation. We must be very clear about this.<h2 class=head1>THE PURPOSE OF THE LAW</h2><h2 class=head2>God’s Original Purpose and Ultimate Intention to Give Us Christ</h2><p>The book of Galatians reveals that the original purpose and ultimate intention of God is to give us Christ. God’s plan and God’s purpose is to give us Christ as everything. At the time of Abraham, God came in to promise him not the law and not seeds but a seed. That promise to Abraham is called the gospel in Galatians 3:8. Verse 8 says, “And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles out of faith, announced the gospel beforehand to Abraham: ‘In you shall all the nations be blessed.’” We may have thought that gospel preaching started after the Lord ascended to the heavens. However, according to Galatians 3 God began to preach the gospel to mankind at least in Genesis 12 when He promised Abraham a seed. The message of the gospel is, “In you shall all the nations be blessed,” and the content of this message is, “your seed, who is Christ.” Verse 16 says, “But to Abraham were the promises spoken and to his seed. He does not say, ‘And to the seeds,’ as concerning many, but as concerning one: ‘And to your seed,’ who is Christ.” God preached the gospel to Abraham, and its message was that all the nations would be blessed in him. The content of the message is that Christ is the unique seed because God’s intention and purpose is to give us Christ as everything.<p>At a certain point in time, before the fullness of the time (4:4), God came in to promise that He would give a seed, Christ. We must realize who this Christ is. Christ is all-inclusive. He is the very embodiment of God; all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him (Col. 2:9). He is the very reality of God; all that God is, all God’s fullness, is embodied in Him. Christ is such a One, yet He became the seed of Abraham. Therefore, He is a man. On the one hand, Christ as the seed is a blessing, and on the other hand, this seed is the one who inherits the blessing (Gal. 3:8-9, 14, 16). Moreover, He is the one who blesses. He is the very God who blesses, He is the promised blessing, and He is the seed who inherits the blessing. This is altogether wonderful! If we want to have a share in this blessing, we must be in Christ. In principle, God does not bless you or me; He blesses only one person, who is the seed. If we desire to receive the blessing, we must be a part of this one seed. We must be in Christ, be a part of Christ, and belong to Christ.<p>Galatians 3:29 says, “And if you are of Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.” The word seed is singular; the descendants of Abraham are many, but they are in Christ. You and I must be in Christ. Christ is everything. He is the one who blesses, the promised blessing, and the One who inherits the blessing.
