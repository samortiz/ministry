   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 1:19 says, "For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here it is not just the Spirit of Jesus but the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word for bountiful supply is a special word used by the Greeks when they referred to the supplying of all the needs of the chorus by the choragus, the leader of the chorus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In ancient times, according to the Greek custom, the leader, the choragus, of the chorus had to prepare and supply everything that the chorus needed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now the apostle Paul used the same word to describe the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans 8:9 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse interchangeably uses the Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE SPIRIT OF GOD IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>AND THE SPIRIT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we want to know what the Spirit is, we first have to distinguish the Spirit of God in the Old Testament from the Spirit in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the fifth chapter of his book The Spirit of Christ, Andrew Murray told us that in the whole Old Testament there is not such a title as the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the entire Old Testament you cannot find the title the Holy Spirit ascribed to the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Psalm 51:11 and Isaiah 63:10-11, Holy Spirit should be translated Spirit of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The title the Holy Spirit was used first in connection with the preparation for the Lord's coming through incarnation Luke 1:15, 35 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was at that time that the holy Scripture used the term the Holy Spirit for the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, this title the Holy Spirit is related to the fact that God mingled Himself with man through incarnation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such a mingling cannot be found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Old Testament mentions a number of times that the Spirit of God, or the Spirit of Jehovah, came down upon the prophets or upon a certain person Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>3:10; 6:34; 11:29; 13:25; 14:6, 19; 15:14; 1 Sam 10:6; 16:13-14; 2 Sam 23:2; 1 Kings 18:12; 22:24; 2 Kings 2:16; 2 Chron 18:23; 20:14; Isa 11:2; 63:14; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>11:5; 37:1; Micah 3:8; Zech 7:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thus, in the Old Testament there was God, and there was the Spirit of God who came down upon people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time the Spirit of God had merely the element of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We know that God passed through a wonderful process in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He became a man in incarnation, and His divinity was mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then He passed through human living, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In resurrection He was glorified and became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How many items are in this Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Son is in this Spirit, the Father is in this Spirit, and, of course, the Spirit is in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The man whom Christ became through incarnation is in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>His human living, the effectiveness of His death, His resurrection, glorification, ascension, enthronement, kingdom, and authority are all included in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 , the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Old Testament, the Spirit of God had merely the element of divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But today all the elements of God, man, human living, death, resurrection, glorification, ascension, enthronement, and the kingdom with the authority are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
