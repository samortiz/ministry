   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE THE STONE WITH THE SEVEN EYES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR GOD S BUILDING THE ENGRAVED STONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Zechariah 3:9 says, For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reference to engraving the stone indicates that this stone is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is difficult to understand this matter of engraving the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In brief, it means that the Lord Jesus, as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In one day, by that engraving on the cross, the Lord Jesus took away all the sins of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the equivalent of John 1:29, which says, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By the latter half of Zechariah 3:9 we know that the stone with the seven eyes is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE SEVEN EYES AND</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SEVEN LAMPS</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Zechariah 4:2 says, What seest thou?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>And I said, I have looked, and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Zechariah 3:9 the building stone has seven eyes, and in this verse the lampstand has seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we exercise our spirit in this matter, we shall surely understand that the lampstand equals the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Both the stone and the lampstand are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Obviously, the stone is for the building, and the lampstand is for light, for enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the stone there are seven eyes, and on the lampstand there are seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the seven lamps of the lampstand must be the seven eyes on the stone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Proceeding to Zechariah 4:10, we read, For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This verse begins with a reference to the day of small things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the eyes of men, the recovery of the building was not a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, no one should despise it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, the recovery of the church life today is not a great thing in the eyes of men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Rather, it is a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But no one should despise it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse also speaks of those seven, which refers to the seven lamps in verse 2.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then we are told that those seven are the eyes of the Lord, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This proves that the building stone with the seven eyes is simply Jehovah, the Lord God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Having this understanding, we come to the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I say again that most of the symbols and other crucial points found in Revelation are not new; they are further developments of items found in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Revelation chapters four and five, we have a new and further development of the seven eyes and the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Revelation 4:5 says, And out of the throne come forth lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire are burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Notice that the seven lamps here are not on the lampstand, but are burning before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The seven lamps that are burning before the throne are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Zechariah 3 and 4 we have the seven eyes and the seven lamps but not the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In Revelation, however, the seven lamps have developed into the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we have a new and further development of the seven lamps as the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 4:5 we are told clearly that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Revelation 5:6 says, And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lamb here has seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 4:5 the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, and in 5:6 the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here we have a further development over Zechariah, for the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes on the stone, but also the seven eyes of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a reference to Zechariah 4:10, where we are told that the seven eyes of the Lord run to and fro through the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Zechariah 3 and 4 we see the seven eyes of the stone, the seven lamps of the lampstand, and the seven eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, the Lord is the stone, and the stone is also the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The stone is both the lampstand and the Lord God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These three the Lord, the lampstand, and the stone are one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Zechariah, we see that the seven eyes are the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But as we come to the further development in Revelation, the seven lamps are no longer just on the lampstand, but are also burning before the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Eventually, these seven Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb who is in the very center of God s administration.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>May we all be deeply impressed with this picture.</S>
