   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In describing this victory, these verses say that God will divide Shechem, that He will measure out the Valley of Succoth, that Gilead and Manasseh are His, that Ephraim is the helmet for His head, that Judah is His scepter, that Moab is His washbowl, that upon Edom He will cast His sandal, and that over Philistia He will shout.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All this shows us God's victory in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A PRAYER OF DAVID,</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TYPIFYING CHRIST, IN HIS SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalm 109 is a wonderful psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because it is a psalm on Christ, those who read the Psalms in a natural way find it hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Written to describe the sufferings of David, Psalm 109 is a prayer offered by David about his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>David here is a type of Christ, and David's sufferings typify Christ's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A. Referring to Judas, Who Betrayed Christ</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 8 says, "May his days be few;/May another take his office."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Acts 1:20 this verse is quoted and applied to Judas, who betrayed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This quotation of verse 8 indicates that Psalm 109 is on Christ and that the sufferings described in this psalm signify the sufferings of Christ in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>B. Answered in the Next Psalm, Psalm 110</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>David's prayer concerning his sufferings typifies Christ's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The prayer in Psalm 109 is answered in the next psalm, Psalm 110.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since Psalm 110 is the answer to the prayer of David as a type of Christ in Psalm 109, Psalm 110 should be considered an answer to Christ's prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hebrews 5:7 says that Christ, in the days of His flesh, "offered up both petitions and supplications with strong crying and tears to Him who was able to save Him out of death."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God answered this prayer not only through resurrection but also in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Psalm 110 unveils Christ in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Psalms 107 through 109, therefore, usher us into Psalm 110.</S>
