   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>For the Believers to Be Partakers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Divine Nature That They May Be</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Glorified with the Divine Glory</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is for us to be partakers of the divine nature that we were made children of God and sons of God that we may be glorified with the divine glory 2 Pet 1:4; Rom 8:30c; Heb 2:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Every day we should partake of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we partake of beef, we partake of the nature of a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If every day we partake of beef, eventually, not only our skin but also our clothing will begin to smell like a cow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, if we eat salmon every day continually, our entire body will smell like salmon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our partaking of the divine nature must be constant.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Being partakers involves more than partaking in an occasional way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must partake of the divine nature every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must eat, drink, and even breathe the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In our human life we breathe more often than we drink, and we drink more often than we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our Christian life, we must breathe, drink, and eat the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We partake constantly of the divine nature so that we may be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To merely improve ourselves does not involve us with a different element.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, to be glorified, we must be involved with the element of God's glory, with the element of God's glorifying nature.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When metal is heated until it becomes red hot, as in welding, it is "glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The element of electricity enters into the metal and makes it hot.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thus, we may say that the electricity glorifies the metal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By partaking of God's divine nature, we are glorified with the divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were regenerated through the resurrection of Christ unto a living hope 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This hope is for our coming glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have been justified, and we will be glorified Rom 8:30c .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since we are now on the way to glory, Hebrews 2:10 tells us that God is leading us, His many sons, into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a young Christian, I was taught that to be glorified was to have our physical defects removed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With this understanding, I thought that for a crippled person to be brought into the Lord's glory meant that his being crippled would be removed at the Lord's coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I held this understanding for quite a time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, I came to realize that this was not the proper understanding of being glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we received the divine life and were regenerated, we became a new being.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This new being is a partaker of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Day after day we must partake of the divine nature, and this divine nature is the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, this divine nature will glorify us, causing us to shine with God's element.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Regeneration includes our upcoming glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, it is correct to say that our regeneration has not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have had a beginning, and now we are on the way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is still much of our being that has not yet been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may think that the process we undergo after our initial regeneration should be called sanctification or transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is certainly true, but in Romans 8:30 Paul mentioned only justification and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are only two of the steps in the long process from regeneration to glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul seemed to skip sanctification, transformation, and conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, the steps of sanctification, transformation, and conformation are included in the ultimate step of glorification, for these steps consummate in glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regeneration begins with justification and consummates in glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Although we have been regenerated, we may still lose our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our losing of our temper indicates that we have not yet been fully regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we lose our temper, we may wonder whether or not we have been regenerated at all.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Yes, we have been regenerated, but not fully.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have been regenerated, but we will not be thoroughly regenerated until we have been glorified.</S>
