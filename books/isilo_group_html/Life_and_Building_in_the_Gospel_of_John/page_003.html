LIFE AND BUILDING IN THE GOSPEL OF JOHN</h2>
<p>John&rsquo;s ministry is focused on life and building. We have seen the matter of life and building over the years, but the more I read the writings of John in his Gospel, Epistles, and Revelation, the more light, anointing, and confirmation I have, and the more I feel that God wants to release messages on life and building among His children in this age. I once did a concise study of the Gospel of John with the brothers and sisters in Manila, but now I am quite burdened to give messages specifically related to life and building on crucial topics in the first few chapters of the Gospel of John.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John is an exceedingly rich book; it would take at least three hundred messages to cover all its topics. Chapter 1, for example, contains many crucial terms and phrases, such as <em>in the beginning was the Word; in Him was life; the life was the light of men; as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God; who were begotten...of God; the Word became flesh and tabernacled; full of grace and reality; for of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace; the law was given through Moses;</em> and <em>grace and reality came through Jesus Christ</em> (vv. 1, 4, 12-14, 16-17). There are many crucial topics within just the first eighteen verses of chapter 1.</p>
<p>The most difficult phrase in this chapter is <em>in the beginning was the Word,</em> which refers to a beginning before there was a beginning in time. This topic cannot be exhausted in just one message, but I can speak only according to what I know and understand.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING</h2>
<p>The beginning spoken of in verse 1 precedes the beginning spoken of in Genesis 1:1, which says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; The beginning in Genesis is the beginning of time, but the beginning in John 1:1 refers to a beginning before the beginning of time. The beginning in Genesis 1:1 is the beginning of time, but the beginning in John 1:1 refers to eternity, which has no beginning in time. The Gospel of John shows that the matter of the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming to be our life was not from the time of John&rsquo;s writing or from the beginning of God&rsquo;s creation of all things but from the beginning of eternity, which has no beginning. This indicates that the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming to be our life should be viewed from the standpoint of eternity. The clothes that we wear or the house that we build are matters related to time; they are not eternal. In contrast, the Lord&rsquo;s entering into us is a matter related to eternity, even though it occurs in time. The beginning of this matter was in eternity, and it was decided in eternity. From our perspective and experience, the Lord&rsquo;s coming as life occurred in time, but from the Lord&rsquo;s perspective, it is eternal in nature.</p>
<p>Whenever we talk about spiritual matters related to God&rsquo;s life, we must realize that there is no limitation related to time. The Gospel of John is not limited to time. The only time that matters in the Gospel of John is eternity. Furthermore, the Gospel of John shows that the life we have received is an eternal life. In the Gospel of John there is no limitation of time; everything is eternal.</p>
<p>In the same principle, there is no issue of space in the Gospel of John. If we want to speak of space, we must speak in terms of God Himself. In the Gospel of John the only time that matters is eternity, and the only space that matters is God Himself. The space that we are in is God Himself. This is the reason that there are so many references to being in God in the Gospel of John (10:38; 14:10, 17; 15:4-5). The Lord even said, &ldquo;I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (14:20). God is our space. We need to remember that God&rsquo;s coming to be our life is a matter that was in the beginning, in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD</h2>
<p>How can God be man&rsquo;s life? This is a crucial matter. God is too wonderful and too mysterious. As the Spirit, He is too abstract for us to fathom or even describe. Nevertheless, John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; In a very simple yet profound way, this shows that God comes to us as the Word. This Word is not an ordinary or light Word but a great and serious Word.</p>
<p>The Word as it relates to the universe may be hard to understand, but humanly speaking we know that a word is a declaration, manifestation, and expression. With every utterance of a word, what goes forth is a declaration, a manifestation, and an expression. When we come to a meeting and listen to a message, some may laugh and others may cry in response to the words, and even when we dismiss the meeting with words, there is the response of standing up and leaving. Words move many things.</p>
<p>The universe originated from God&rsquo;s speaking. Psalm 33:9 says, &ldquo;He spoke, and it was.&rdquo; God created all things through speaking; as soon as He spoke, it was. Therefore, Hebrews 11:3 says, &ldquo;By faith we understand that the universe has been framed by the word of God.&rdquo; When God created all things, He did not use any material or method; He just spoke. His speaking was His method, and His word was His material. Even today God is &ldquo;upholding and bearing all things by the word of His power&rdquo; (1:3). The Word in the Gospel of John is the Lord Jesus, who came to be our life (1:1, 4, 14).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life and Building in the Gospel of John &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
