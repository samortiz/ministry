   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ANOINTING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Praise the Lord that the life-giving Spirit is now moving in us, acting in us, and anointing us!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The anointing of the Spirit may be compared to painting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As coat after coat of paint is applied to a chair, so through the anointing of the all-inclusive Spirit the divine element with the divine essence is applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit within us is continually anointing us, continually painting us with the divine paint, the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Holy Spirit as the ointment is the paint, and this paint includes the divine holiness and all the divine virtues and attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The anointing is the moving of this Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This anointing is actually the dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whether we call this anointing or dispensing, this is a matter of the processed Triune God being applied to us in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All we need to do is simply stay under this anointing, stay in this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let us stay under the divine dispensing and get soaked with the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>RECEIVING THE DIVINE DISPENSING</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because our need is to be soaked with the Triune God, we should not make up our mind to improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For example, we all have a problem with our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do you think that you are an exception and that you have a good temper instead of a bad temper?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The fact is that regarding the problem of temper, we are all the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as frogs have a croaking life and dogs have a barking life, we have a temper-losing life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you know why you complain and get angry?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You complain and get angry because you have that kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because we are what we are, we should not make up our minds to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A frog cannot stop croaking, a dog cannot stop barking, and we cannot improve our temper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This problem is rooted in our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Instead of trying to change your nature, simply receive the divine anointing, the divine dispensing, from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Keep yourself open to this dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you continually receive the divine dispensing, it will overcome your temper.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Actually, to overcome our temper or our besetting sins is not in itself a great matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is truly a great matter is for us to be saturated with the divine element through the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>REAL SANCTIFICATION AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This saturation with the divine element through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity is real sanctification and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, this dispensing will issue in conformation and consummate in glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This means that through the divine dispensing we shall be like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hallelujah, we shall be like Him not only in glory outwardly, but also with the divine element inwardly!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We shall be the same as He in element, essence, and substance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This will be the result of being saturated with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Year by year and day by day, we need to be soaked with the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the experience of the divine dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SPREADING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Romans 8:10 says that because Christ is in us, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to verse 6, if our mind is set on the spirit, the mind will also become life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, according to verse 11, if the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in us, this One will give life to our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These verses indicate that the soaking, the saturating, begins with our spirit, spreads to our mind, and eventually reaches our mortal body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hallelujah, our spirit is life!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our mind can also be life, and our body can receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The dispensing God is also the spreading One.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He spreads Himself from our spirit to our mind, and through our mind into our body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our God is living not only on the throne in the heavens; He is also living in us, in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is spreading Himself into every part of our being and saturating us with Himself until we are fully soaked with all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is God s full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The goal of God s salvation is to make us sons of God so that we may be the living members of the Body of His Son, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hallelujah for the dispensing of the Divine Trinity!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hallelujah for the goal of God s salvation!</S>
