   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ROCKY PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Those with shallow earth may still have a desire for deep roots, but there are rocks that block the way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are rocks where the roots are.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They may outwardly look the same as other soil; just like others, they are filled with dust and mud.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But within there are hidden sins and the self.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Outwardly, they look the same as everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They can listen as others listen and speak as others speak.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in hidden places, big rocks block the way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why they cannot be deep.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What are the rocks?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, rocks have many meanings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I can only mention one today, the hardened heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you want to be spiritual, you must not have a hardened heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many people have never received a blow to their will; their self has never been broken before God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They can say a great deal about God s will and provide many reasonings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They always have their own ideas about God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They always say I think that something should be done this way or that way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God has not yet destroyed their wisdom, nor torn down their will.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are still scheming and planning, but there are rocks underneath, so they cannot go deep.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Brothers and sisters, allow me to say an honest word: we cannot have real spiritual progress unless we allow ourselves to be broken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The cross is our only source of progress.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If God does not break us, we will never become useful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He must break the rocks beneath us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, we will never be deep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only one kind of people will go all the way down to the depths; they are the ones who are as soft as a child.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only one kind of people can take firm roots; they are the ones who fear and tremble at God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Unfortunately, a countless number of people have to think before they will make a decision concerning God s command!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They think that God s command requires discernment and selection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thank the Lord that there are also many here who have obeyed in a very simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thank the Lord that there are many who only care who is giving the command and never question why before they obey.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, a disobedient heart is a rock.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>May God shine His light on us, so that we may see the enormity of the rock within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The rocks are not only your self; they are your hidden sins.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In your life there is always one sin which has not been removed because of the high price; it remains there, and you are reluctant to remove it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you leave it there, you will never receive spiritual riches; you will never go deeper because of it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, you have to deal thoroughly with your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even the hidden sins have to be dealt with thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you have not dealt thoroughly with the hidden sins, and if the stubborn self is not thoroughly dealt with, your roots will never be deep.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, how many things has God pointed His finger at in you?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Are you unwilling to look at Him?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Are you fighting and refusing to surrender?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps there is already a problem between you and God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Perhaps you have seen God s will and are debating with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is what the Lord wants to show you today.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brothers, if you really want to serve Him and acquire the truth before Him, the large rocks must be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Otherwise, the earth will always be shallow, and the roots will not be deep.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you cannot remove the hidden sins, the stubborn self, and the opinions that are expressed as I don t want to and I will not, you will never acquire any spiritual power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there is a problem between you and God, it will be impossible for the earth to have any depth or the roots to be deep.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thank the Lord that in spite of this, He can still do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your heart is hardened, but the Lord can change you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I know that many people here have been smitten by God before.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But I also know that there are many here who are quite stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if the Lord can break others, He can also break you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the Lord was able to sit on a donkey that had never been sat on when He entered Jerusalem, He can sit on you as well.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Anyone who has ever sat on a donkey knows that a donkey that has never been sat on is the most difficult kind.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the Lord could do it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He could very safely sit on that donkey and enter Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the same way, He can sit on you.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although you are very stubborn before God, the Lord can break you, no matter how stubborn you are.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You should sincerely pray today, Lord, I am really hard within.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Many times I have held onto my own will and have insisted on my own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That is why so many times, I have been a shallow person.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Please break me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not know how shallow our life is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we allow God to break our hardened heart, if we do not live by our feelings or the environment, and if we ask God to give us more of a hidden life, we will see forward progress.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we deal thoroughly with every cross that comes our way and take up the cross every time it comes, we will become deeper and deeper, moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Although we have read two other passages of Scripture, I cannot cover them in detail today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I can only speak about them briefly because there is not much time left, and I have already covered much of what I wanted to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Let us cover these passages just a little to make up for what we have missed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In Hosea 14 Lebanon is mentioned three times.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First, it is mentioned in contrast to the lily.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Second, it is mentioned in contrast to the olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Third, it is mentioned in contrast to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lebanon is repeatedly mentioned; there is Lebanon in contrast to the lily, Lebanon in contrast to the olive tree, and Lebanon in contrast to the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Lebanon is repeatedly mentioned because there is a kind of cedar tree in Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Cedar trees are tall trees with very deep roots.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Very few trees have roots as deep as the cedar tree.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Bible considers the cedar trees of Lebanon to be the greatest trees in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>They signify those who will take deep roots.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not treasure what the world says to you, because the Bible shows that the Lord is only pleased with those who have roots that go downward.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In this passage the Lord shows us three things.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>First, He made a contrast between the lily and Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Second, He made a contrast between the olive tree and Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Third, He made a contrast between the vine and Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Why does the Lord make a contrast between the lily and Lebanon?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He makes the contrast because the lily is very attractive.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Christians should not have flowers that are grown in gardens, but in the valley.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Lilies grow in the wilderness, not in homes.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They grow in the valley and do not need gardeners to cultivate them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Rather, they are sustained by water from heaven; they are fully cultivated and sustained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The beauty of the lily lies in the wilderness; it lies before God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hosea 14:6 says also that Israel s splendor shall be as the olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>According to my consideration, there is absolutely no beauty in the olive tree.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It would be more plausible and real to say that its beauty shall be as the peony.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Saying that its beauty shall be as the olive tree does not seem too appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, God s beauty is not in appearance but in fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We know that the olive tree is a tree bearing fruit for oil; it is a tree that bears the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The beauty of the olive tree lies in its fruit, which typifies the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This is something inward; it is not something that appears before men.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Further on, it says that Israel shall grow as the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>I do not know how many of you have seen blossoms on a vine.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>We have grown a vine in our home every year since my youth.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But I have never seen anyone putting vine blossoms in a vase, and I have never seen vine blossoms.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Unless you look for them carefully, you cannot find the blossoms; the blossoms are as small as specks of dust.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Before they have fully blossomed, they become grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Why does it not say peach blossoms or plum blossoms instead of vine blossoms?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The one reason is that our flower is not for beauty, but for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>There are three kinds of flowers in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>One is for display only, like the chrysanthemum flower.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Another is both for display and for fruit, like the plum blossom.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The third is for fruit-bearing alone, like the blossoms on the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God has no intention that we be like the plum blossom or chrysanthemum flower, which are for display.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>God has only one requirement: we have to have roots that go downward.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Lebanon is mentioned three times, and each time we are told to take care of the hidden life.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Perhaps a life that bears spiritual fruit does not look that good.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The prayer life is not something that looks good.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>However, we are living to God and as long as God considers it to be good, that is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>A similar passage is found in the Song of Solomon 4:12, which says, A garden enclosed is my sister, my bride, / A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The word spring is translated well in the Chinese Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>A garden enclosed means that it is not a public garden; it is not a garden into which everyone can go.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Rather, it is a garden enclosed, reserved for special ones.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>The flower in our garden is set apart for Christ and is not for anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Not everyone can see it.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>A well shut up.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>There is a difference between a well and fountain.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>A well is something man-made, while a fountain is something natural.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Abraham always dug wells.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Whenever his servants found a source, he dug a well.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>However, a fountain is natural and has not been worked on by man.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The Lord says that we are a garden enclosed and that we are not open at any other time; the only time we are open is when we open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>We are also a well shut up.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>A well is for man s use.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>However, even though it is for man s use, it is still limited by the Lord and shut up for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The fountain signifies what we have received from God; it signifies the joy we have received from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The well is before man, while the fountain is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>None of these can be shown to others purposely; they are all concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>All of our experiences in prayer should be concealed and not made public.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Even the part that is for man is concealed.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>In short, all the good things that we possess should be locked up for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>All of the speaking today concerns only one thing, that is, to go down.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>We have no goal other than allowing the cross to do a deeper work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Brothers and sisters, there are too many superficial and shallow things.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>There are too many things growing outside, exposed on the surface, and seen only by man.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>What is lacking is a hidden part before God.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>What God is seeking today and the one thing that grips our heart, is a hidden life before Him, something invisible to man.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>The life that God wants is like the life of a sister, a life that is hidden in the background.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>God has no intention that we put everything on the outside and have nothing hidden and secret.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>May God grant us the grace to accept His demands and not be as we were before.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>May we ask and allow God to grant us a real breaking so that we can go on in the way ahead.</S>
