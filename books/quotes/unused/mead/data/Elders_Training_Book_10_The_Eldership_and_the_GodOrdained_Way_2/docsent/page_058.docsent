   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE TEST OF THE CHURCH IN LAODICEA</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BOASTING, "I AM RICH AND HAVE BECOME RICH</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>AND HAVE NEED OF NOTHING," NOT KNOWING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THAT IT WAS WRETCHED, MISERABLE,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>POOR, BLIND, AND NAKED</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>REVELATION 3:17</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>An opinionated and lukewarm church would always be proud and boast of its riches, thinking that it has need of nothing, but not knowing its wretchedness, miserableness, poverty, blindness, and nakedness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the loving and merciful Lord counsels such a church to buy, to obtain at a cost from Him, refined gold the tested faith for partaking of the divine nature , white garments the conduct approvable to the Lord , and anointing eye salve the anointing Spirit, the Lord Himself as the life-giving Spirit as their remedies v. 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The above items, XLI to LI, are all the negative items in which the seven local churches in Asia were different from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The seven churches as the seven golden lampstands were all identical in the positive things concerning the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But they were abnormally different in these eleven cases, all of which are serious tests that have done tremendous damage to the oneness of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, the Lord advised all seven churches to overcome all these tests that they might be rewarded 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Otherwise, they will be punished 2:5, 11 by implication 16, 22-23; 3:3, 11, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The seven local churches in Asia were sovereignly arranged by the Lord so that they might typify all the churches in the seven stages of the church age.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, regardless of what stage we are in as a local church, we should take care of all the eleven cases of negative things in the proper way as shown in Revelation 2 and 3.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May the Lord have mercy on us and afford us His grace and blessing that we might not be negligent and indifferent in dealing with all these oneness-damaging problems.</S>
