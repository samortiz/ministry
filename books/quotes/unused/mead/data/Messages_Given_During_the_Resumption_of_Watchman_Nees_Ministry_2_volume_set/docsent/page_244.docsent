   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>One brother asked: What should be our relationship with our family: Should we contend with them, or should we yield to them?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Brother Witness Lee: Concerning the disposal of money that you have handed over, you should not insist on doing anything if your wife, children, or parents raise objections to it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You cannot measure others by your own spiritual standard, and you cannot require others to be the same as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whatever others ask for, you have to give to them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If they want better clothing, you should do your best to satisfy them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You should only consecrate what you have when others are motivated to do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The more you contend for these things, the more tightly they will hold onto them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The more you yield, the more they will let go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nevertheless, as long as your heart is delivered from money and fleshly desires, you have done a great thing already.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One sister refused to go to the movie with her husband after she was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more her husband wanted her to do it, the more she would oppose, and the more she would give her husband a long face.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the husband came home at night, she would not open the door in order to let him know that she was not happy with him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One day, she came to me in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I told her, "Your attitude was totally wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your husband has not seen what you have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You cannot treat him this way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You should happily accompany him to the entrance of the cinema and say to him, Sorry, I cannot go in, but I will wait for you at home.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You can go in and watch the movie.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will go home and prepare some nice food for you.'</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the meantime, you should open the door and wait for him to come home."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Let me tell you, this is the proper Christian way.</S>
