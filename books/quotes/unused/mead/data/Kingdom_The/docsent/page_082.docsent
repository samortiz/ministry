   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The number twelve is not the result of addition but of multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If it were the result of addition, the number would be seven and not twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the early chapters of the book of Revelation, we see the addition of three plus four, giving us seven churches, seven lampstands, seven seals, and seven trumpets Rev 1:4, 12; 6:1; 8:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At the beginning of Revelation, three and four are added to make seven; at the end of Revelation, four and three are multiplied to make twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is quite meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the church today, we are the number seven because we are the creatures plus the Triune God in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Triune God in His resurrection life has been added to us, making us the number seven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church is the addition of God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, this is only the beginning, for the addition must be changed into multiplication.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Multiplication means mingling, the mingling of three with four, which signifies the mingling of the Triune God in resurrection with man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the time we were saved, God was added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thereafter, addition will be changed into multiplication until we reach the full multiplication which is the number twelve man multiplied by God, man mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The New Jerusalem is the corporate and consummate mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Why is there the number ten rather than twelve in the parable of the virgins?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that two are lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ten indicates the majority of twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Of the twelve tribes of Israel in the Old Testament, ten rebelled against the House of David.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only two tribes, Judah and Benjamin, were left.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>So ten out of twelve means the majority of twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We see the same thought in an instance in the Gospels: ten of the twelve Apostles had one concept, and the other two Apostles had a different concept Matt 20:20-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Again, ten represents the majority of the twelve, with two as the remainder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the number ten signifies the majority of the people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To find the remaining two you must read the preceding chapter Matthew 24:40-42.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These verses mention two men working in the field or two women grinding at the mill. In Matthew 25 we have the number ten; in Matthew 24 we have the number two.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The concluding word of these two portions is the same: "Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes" Matt 24:42; 25:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word of warning was given both to the two and to the ten, indicating that they go together.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The two plus the ten equal twelve, the complete number of God's people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord Jesus returns, the believers will be of two classes.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The primary division is ten and two.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because the two men or two women were working, they represent the believers who will be alive when the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The ten, on the contrary, were all asleep indicating that the majority of the believers will have died by the time the Lord returns.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do not consider that only the five foolish virgins slept while the five wise virgins did not.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible says that all ten were asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What does it mean for the believers in Christ to sleep?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Thessalonians 4:14-16 tells us clearly that for the believers to sleep means they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the eyes of God, the dead believers are not actually dead; they are sleeping, resting, and waiting for the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By this we can see that the ten virgins represent the dead saints; both the foolish and the wise have died because of the delay in the Bridegroom's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The foolish ones died and the wise ones, including Peter, John, Martin Luther, and many other saints, also died.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They were waiting and expecting the Lord's coming back, but He tarried so they all slumbered and slept.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The ten virgins represent the dead saints, and the other two represent the living saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the Lord returns, the majority of the saints will be among the dead ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The living saints will be the remainder, signified by the two.</S>
