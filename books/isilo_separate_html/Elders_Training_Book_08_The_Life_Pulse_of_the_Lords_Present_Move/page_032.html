<p>The real meaning of being full-time is to live to Him. To go full-time does not mean to drop your job and become a preacher. It does not mean that you give up your business and become one who preaches the gospel or who labors in the word all the time. A full-timer is one who lives to the Lord. Who should be such a one? Every believer, without one exception. As long as you are a believer, you have to realize you should be one living to Him. We have to live to Him because He is ours and we are His. To live to Him is based upon the fact that we are His. Not only is He ours, but we also are His.</p>
<p>After the wedding, a man and woman become a couple living together. They are living as one. Verse 3 of <em>Hymns</em> 473 says in two lines, &ldquo;All things are yours when you are His, and He and you are one.&rdquo; As a married couple, the husband and wife are one. They should not only live for one another but to one another. He should live to her and she should live to him.</p>
<p>When a husband tells a wife that he lives for her and does everything for her, he is not up to the standard. Actually, his heart is not one thousand percent for his wife. There is some reservation. If the husband would tell his wife that he lives <em>to</em> her, this makes a great difference. To live to the Lord includes living for, by, with, and in Him. This is one being two and two in one. There is not only no separation between us and the Lord but also no distinction when we are living to Him.</p>
<p>Because the husband is merely living for the wife, she has to get his permission to spend his money. But when the husband lives to the wife, that means he and his wife are one. His money is hers, and her money is his. When she is going to spend money, she does not need to get her husband&rsquo;s permission. Some couples may even argue because one used the money without the other&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p>When the Lord is going to spend your money, you may say, &ldquo;Lord, this money is for You, but not today.&rdquo; When we feel good and happy, we would give our money to the Lord. We are merely for the Lord. Because we are only for the Lord, the Lord is only for us. Whenever we want something of the Lord, we need to get His permission. You may ask the Lord for something, and the Lord may respond, &ldquo;Everything is for you, but not today. Today I am not happy with you. I will wait for a time when you make Me happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of us claim that we love the Lord and that we and all that we have are for Him. But whatever the Lord would require of you, He needs your permission. You have not gone up to the standard that you are living to Him. If you are living to Him, He does not need to get your permission for whatever He needs of you. Likewise, if the Lord is living to you, you do not need to get His permission for whatever you want of Him. You just use it.</p>
<p>To be full-time means that you live to the Lord. You do not live for Him but to Him. This is a great privilege. A full-timer does not mean what we may think. A full-timer is one who lives to the Lord; every believer, as one bought by the Lord with a price, should be a person living to the Lord. He is yours and you are His. He and you are one. He is to you and you are to Him. There is no distinction in anything. He does not need your permission to use you, nor do you need His permission to use Him. He is ready to be like this to you, but you may not be ready. You may be quite reserving and hesitating. The husband may have the confidence in the wife to be one with her and to be everything to her, but the wife may still be doubting. She may be thinking, &ldquo;If I tell him I am to him, he may take away everything I have. Then what shall I do? Do I have the security?&rdquo; This illustrates the present situation, mostly among us. Most of us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery do love the Lord, and we would say that whatever we are and whatever we have are all for the Lord. We do not realize, however, how subtle it is when we say that we are for the Lord.</p>
<p>Regardless of how much you say that you are for the Lord, the Lord has no right to touch anything of yours because it is yours. It is yours for Him and you for Him&mdash;not to Him. Suppose my wife brought me my lunch and said, &ldquo;I am bringing some food for you.&rdquo; This is not as good as her saying, &ldquo;I am bringing some food to you.&rdquo; Could you differentiate between these two expressions&mdash;&ldquo;I have something for you&rdquo; or &ldquo;I bring something to you&rdquo;? &ldquo;To me&rdquo; means that it immediately becomes my possession with me as the owner. When you say &ldquo;for me,&rdquo; who possesses it? To whom does it belong?</p>
<p>When you say that you are for the Lord and that you live for the Lord, you think that is good. Actually, it may not be so good. It is subtle. There may be a kind of subtle reservation within you. You could say you are for the Lord, but you dare not say you live to the Lord. Many of us have read the portions of the Word in the Scripture reading many times, but we have never paid attention to the difference between living to the Lord and living for the Lord. When you see a vision through your subtlety, you may realize that in the past you have always been living for the Lord and not to the Lord. Perhaps you have never lived to the Lord. I saw marriages in which the husband and the wife both kept things for themselves. When either of them wanted to use something belonging to the other, they had to have a long talk. Actually, they needed a long negotiation. They even negotiated in terms, in conditions. If the husband gave the wife something, he required the wife to give him something in return or in exchange. One particular person got married, but with a condition that his wife had no share of whatever he had gained. He may be living for his wife, but he is not living to her. I hope we are beginning to understand what it means to be for the Lord and what it means to be to the Lord. Are you for the Lord? This is subtle. Many saints throughout the years told me that they were for the Lord.</p>
<p>You are for the Lord at your pleasure. When you feel happy or when you feel it is convenient, you give something for the Lord and do something for the Lord. When you do not feel happy or that it is convenient, you do not do anything for the Lord. We must be enlightened to see that to be for the Lord is not adequate.</p>
<p>Marriage means that the sister is one couple with her husband. The real meaning of marriage life is not one for another but to one another. &ldquo;One for another&rdquo; is still two. &ldquo;To one another&rdquo; means that this couple became one at their wedding. Mary altogether lost her possession to John at their wedding, and John lost his possession, his ownership, altogether to Mary. They became a couple not for one another but to one another. Every believer should be like this to the Lord. You have been bought as slaves with a price. The Lord is yours and you are His. He is to you and you are to Him. Whatever you do, you do to Him. When you go to school to study, you study to Him. If you go to be a banker to make a lot of money, you make money to Him. As a wife who raises children, you raise up children to Him, not to yourself. Paul said &ldquo;none of us lives to himself&rdquo; (Rom. 14:7). We do not live to ourselves but to Him. This is what it means to be full-time. We all should be like this.</p>
<p>We have to recognize that we are Christians. This title or designation implies belonging. It does not only mean that you are a &ldquo;Christ-man&rdquo; but it also means that you are a man belonging to Christ. When the ancient Romans referred to the believers as Christians, they meant that these people belonged to Christ. Because you are His, everything about you must be to Him. The practical meaning of the title Christian is not that we are men for Christ but that we are men belonging to Christ. Because we absolutely belong to Him, we breathe to Him, we sleep to Him, we eat to Him, and we drink to Him. You do not need to say that you are doing something for Him because you belong to Him. Whatever you are, you are to Him; whatever you do, you do to Him; whatever you possess, you possess to Him; whatever you own, you own to Him; the money that you have, you have to Him. If you say that you have something for the Lord, you are still the owner. You still possess and keep it, but you keep it for Him. It is not to Him. To be to Him is much deeper.</p>
<p>When we are living to the Lord, we do not need to talk about consecration. Suppose that after Mary and John had been married for three days, Mary repented to John and said, &ldquo;John, for these three days I didn&rsquo;t do things for you. Now I want to consecrate and offer myself to you.&rdquo; John&rsquo;s response would be: &ldquo;Mary, it&rsquo;s too late. You are already married to me. You don&rsquo;t need to offer yourself to me. You belong to me already. I am your possessor, your owner. Why do you need to offer yourself to me? You are annulling our wedding.&rdquo; In like manner, sometimes your consecration really means a cancellation. It indicates that you have canceled your marriage with Christ. You have to realize that on the day you were saved, you got married to Christ, and He has already bought you. The most you can say is, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. When I was saved, I didn&rsquo;t realize that I got married to You and that from that day I belonged to You. Now that I realize this, I want to repent and live to You. I want to realize or resume the real marriage life from this hour.&rdquo; The Lord desires that we be to Him since we belong to Him already. Do not say that you are for Him. To say that you are for Him indicates that you still possess something under your ownership.</p>
<p>In our fellowship in this chapter, I believe we have touched the bottom of the significance of what it means to be full-time. The job-dropping full-timers may not have realized that they should be to the Lord. The most they may have realized is that they are for the Lord. They are not to the Lord. To be for the Lord means that you still could be away from the Lord. If you are to the Lord, you could never be away from Him. To be to the Lord means that you are one with Him. It means that we breathe to the Lord, eat to Him, walk to Him, and even exercise to Him. If you are practicing the real ownership of the Lord, you will do everything to Him.</p>
<p>I hope we all can realize the proper denotation of the spiritual term &ldquo;full-time.&rdquo; To be full-time does not mean that you need to give up your job. To be a full-timer means that whatever you do, you do to the Lord; whatever you are, you are to the Lord; and whatever you have, you have to the Lord. If you remain in a job, you remain there to the Lord. If you leave your job, you leave it to the Lord. As long as you are to the Lord you are a full-timer. Whatever you have to do practically all depends upon the One to whom you live. He leads you. Then you know whether you have to remain in a job or leave a job or whether you need to get married or remain single. It does not mean that if you remain single, you are full-time and that if you get married, you are not full-time. To be full-time simply means to live to the Lord.</p>
<p>Every dear saint who really means business with the Lord must be one all the way living to Him. Paul said that even when we die, we die to Him (Rom. 14:8). Thus, there is no problem concerning whether we live a longer life or whether we die today. If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. There is no difference. Whatever I do and whatever happens to me, I am to the Lord because I am one with Him. To think that only those who give up their job to do the Lord&rsquo;s work are full-time is a wrong understanding. This is still the understanding under the influence of degraded Christianity.</p>
<p>The matter of being full-time is implied in the cluster of the divine Word in the Scripture reading of this chapter. You realize that you have been bought by the Lord with His precious blood as the purchasing price. Now He is your Lord and Master, and you belong to Him. He is yours and you are His. Whatever you have, you have to Him. Whatever you do, you do to Him. Whatever you are, you are to Him. Everything is altogether to Him. This surely puts you in a position to take everything He has. You have the privilege. Because you are to Him, He is to you. As long as you are to the Lord every wrong will be adjusted. We cannot abuse the Lord&rsquo;s possessions as long as we are to Him. We have been wrong, wild, and so far from the central lane because we are always for the Lord. It is possible to debate with other brothers for the Lord. But you could not say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, I am debating with you to the Lord.&rdquo; If you can say that you are to the Lord, you will immediately be adjusted.</p>
<p>When you say that you are a full-timer, it means that you are to the Lord. If the Lord really wanted you to drop your job and you would not do it, you could still say that you were for the Lord. But deep within, you could not say that you were to the Lord. If you cannot say that you are remaining in your job to the Lord, this indicates you have to give up that job. Whether or not you should leave your job has to be checked. When you leave your job, do you have the feeling deep within that you are leaving your job to the Lord? When you remain in a job, are you remaining there to the Lord? Whether you leave your job or remain in it, depends upon whether you can say that you are to the Lord. Then you have the security. Do not ask someone whether or not you should leave your job. Just check within as to whether you can say you are leaving your job to the Lord or remaining in your job to the Lord. Whichever way you can say that you are to the Lord is where you need to be. If you cannot say &ldquo;to the Lord,&rdquo; you should not do it. This is a very deep test. Everyone among us is a full-timer. Since we are altogether to the Lord, our time and our money are also to Him. Nothing is to ourselves because none of us lives to ourselves but to Him.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
