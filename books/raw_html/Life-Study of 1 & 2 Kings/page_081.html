<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND KINGS</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REIGNS OF AZARIAH, JOTHAM,<br>AND AHAZ OVER JUDAH<br>AND OF ZECHARIAH, SHALLUM, MENAHEM,<br>PEKAHIAH, AND PEKAH OVER ISRAEL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 15&#151;16</H1><P>Second Kings 15 and 16 cover the reigns of Azariah, Jotham, and Ahaz over Judah and the reigns of Zechariah, Shallum, Menahem, Pekahiah, and Pekah over Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE REIGN OF AZARIAH (UZZIAH) OVER JUDAH</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Reigning for Fifty-two Years in Jerusalem</H2><P>At the age of sixteen, Azariah (Uzziah) began to reign over Judah in the twenty-seventh year of Jeroboam king of Israel and reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem (15:1-2; 14:21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Doing What Was Right in the Sight of Jehovah</H2><P>Azariah did what was right in the sight of Jehovah, according to all that his father Amaziah had done. But Azariah did not remove the high places, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places (15:3-4).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Stricken by Jehovah<br>so That He Became a Leper</H2><P>Due to his trespass in touching the priestly service, Azariah was stricken by Jehovah so that he became a leper until the day of his death (v. 5a; 2 Chron. 26:16-21). He did not keep God's ordinance that only the priests ordained by God could participate in the priestly service. Azariah overstepped and touched the priestly service. This was a great offense to God, and it led to Azariah's becoming a leper.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D.
