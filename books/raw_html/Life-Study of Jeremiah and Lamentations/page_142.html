<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. AFTER THE FALL OF JERUSALEM</H2><P>In 39:11-14 and 40:1&#151;44:30 we have a record of certain things that happened after the fall of Jerusalem.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Release of Jeremiah</H2><P>In 39:11-14 and 40:1-6 there is a word regarding the release of Jeremiah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. From the Court of the King's Guard</H2><P>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon commanded Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard to take Jeremiah and look after him and do no evil to him but deal with him just as Jeremiah would tell him (39:11-12). So Nebuzaradan and all the chief officers of Nebuchadnezzar sent men and took Jeremiah from the court of the guard and gave him to Gedaliah to take him home. And he dwelt among the people (vv. 13-14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. From the Chains among the Exiles</H2><P>While Jeremiah was bound in chains among all the exiles of Jerusalem and Judah, who were being exiled to Babylon, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard let him go (released him) from Ramah (40:1). He said to Jeremiah, "Now, behold, I release you today from the chains which are on your hands. If it is good in your sight to come to Babylon with me, come, and I will look after you; but if it is evil in your sight to come with me to Babylon, let it be so. See, all the land is before you; wherever it is good and right in your sight to go, there go" (v. 4). While Jeremiah still had not turned away, the captain of the bodyguard said that he should return to Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Then he went on to say that Jeremiah could go wherever it was right in his sight to go. After speaking to Jeremiah in this way, the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present and let him go. Then Jeremiah came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and dwelt with him among the people who were left in the land (vv. 5-6).</P>
