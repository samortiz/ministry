   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED THIRTY THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 15 Scripture Reading: Exo 28:31-38; 39:22-26, 30-31; Isa 6:1; Psa 133:2; Rev 1:13; Eph 1:23</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In typology garments signify expression.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is especially true of the priestly garments, garments that were for glory and beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Beauty and glory are both for expression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a foregoing message we pointed out that, humanly speaking, garments are for covering, for warmth, and for beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But in the record concerning the priestly garments, the emphasis is on beauty and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Beauty is human, and glory is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the priestly garments are the expression of Christ s human beauty and divine glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The garments worn by the high priest were unusual.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, there was a tunic, which may have reached the ankles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Over the tunic there was a robe, which reached to the feet, and upon the robe there was the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Upon the ephod there were the breastplate and the two shoulder-pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All these garments contain significant aspects of typology regarding Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE EXPRESSION OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The incarnated Christ is the embodiment of God, and this embodiment is an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one has ever seen God, but the Son of God, the only begotten, has manifested Him John 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This manifestation of God in Christ is God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that Christ is the expression of the invisible and mysterious God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As the expression of God, Christ makes God visible and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we contact Christ, we contact the visible, practical God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now God is no longer only mysterious and invisible; in Christ, He is practical and visible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ as God s expression has made God visible and practical to us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The expression of God is both individual and corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As God s expression, Christ is not only individual, but also corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Christ was on earth, He was the individual expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But after His death and resurrection, this expression became corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the four Gospels we see the individual Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But in Acts, the Epistles, and Revelation, Christ is no longer merely individual, for He has become corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the Epistles and Revelation we see the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this message we shall consider the robe worn by the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What does this long robe signify in typology?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To find the answer, let us turn to Isaiah 6:1: In the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to this verse, Isaiah had a vision of the Lord sitting in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word train here refers to the skirt of the Lord s long robe.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Isaiah does not tell us how long this skirt was, but he does say that it filled the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one has ever seen a bride whose wedding garment was so long that it filled the place where the wedding was held.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No bride has such a fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But because the Lord is so full, His skirt fills the temple, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What does this long train signify?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It signifies the expression of Christ s virtues see John 12:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord s fullness is shown in all His virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose the Lord was very much lacking in virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In that case He would not be expressed by a long garment with the train filling the temple, for He would not have any fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If someone were to wear a garment that did not properly cover his body, this would indicate that this person was short of virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if he is properly covered, this shows that he is full of virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord is full of virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, when He sits in His dwelling place, His long train fills the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This means that the Lord s dwelling place is full of His virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Psalm 133 also refers to the long robe of the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the divine anointing oil was poured upon Aaron, the high priest, that ointment ran down from the head to the beard and then to the skirts of his garment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, in Revelation 1:13, the Lord Jesus has a garment reaching to the feet.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is a sign that the Lord s virtues are so extensive that they become His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should never think that the Lord s long robe is devoid of significance.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Based upon biblical usage, such a long robe surely signifies the virtues of Christ, and these virtues are His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He expressed God in the divine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If His human living had been short of these virtues, it would not have been possible for Him to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God was expressed in Jesus through the divine virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As He walked on earth, He walked in a way that was full of virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>His expression certainly had a long train.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For example, when He was in that little cottage in Bethany, His train filled the room.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Likewise, when He walked on the streets of Jerusalem, His virtues filled the city.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>That was the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, in the Bible a long garment with a long skirt signifies the fullness of the virtues of the one clothed with that garment.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In this universe what is the fullness of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Ephesians 1:23 says that the church is the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>How great Christ is!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is all-inclusive and all-extensive, filling all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because He is so great, inclusive, and extensive, He surely needs a fullness to express what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This fullness is the church.</S>
