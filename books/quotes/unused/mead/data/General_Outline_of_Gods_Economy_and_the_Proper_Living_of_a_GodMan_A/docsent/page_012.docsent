   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Living and walking in and according to the mingled spirit Rom 8:4.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In everything taking Christ as the secret Phil 4:12.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This being: To live out the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To live out the pneumatic Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To live out the consummated Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This being equivalent to living in the resurrection denoting a person of the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This also being: To live out the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To become an unprecedented revival among all the Christ-pursuing God-men today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be the means for the Lord to close this age and bring in His kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Prayer: Lord, we have been under Your visitation for many years and have been brought into Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But, O Lord, we truly regret that due to our dullness we have hindered You.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have lived in the natural realm; we have lived in our religious understanding, our ethical understanding, and our own understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We ask for Your forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We really do not want to remain veiled as we were in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We pray to You as the blind man did: "Lord, that I may receive my sight!"</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today, since the age has changed, cause us to have a change that we may catch up with this age.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>O Lord, enable us to forget the things which are behind, as the apostle Paul did, that we may press forward to the things which are before us Your vision and revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We pray that You would visit us here again that we may earnestly pursue not only to see or know something but also to see a vision, even Your present vision.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>O Lord, grant us Your visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We also need the covering and protection of Your precious blood from the enemy's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We truly recognize that You have put us in the days of warfare to wage a long-term battle.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>O Lord, cover us again and resist the enemy's attack for us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Based on the fellowship in the preceding three messages, my burden in this message is to speak concerning the proper living of a Christ-pursuing God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Very few in Christianity have a proper understanding of the term "God-man"; some of them even oppose the use of this term.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They reject not only the teaching concerning our being God-men but also the teaching concerning Christ's being a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, if you do not believe that Christ is a God-man, this is tantamount to not confessing that Christ has come in the flesh 1 John 4:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only a small number of people confess that Christ is a God-man, and among this small number, there are some who do not acknowledge that today we are God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They say that we are Christians, believers, and saints but not God-men, and that to say that we are God-men is blasphemy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, there is a great debate regarding the truth concerning the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In A.D. 325, Athanasius, a young theologian who was a student under the church fathers and who assisted in the drafting of the Nicene Creed, made a statement: "God became man that man might become God." This statement became an aphorism in Christianity for generations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in the past several hundred years it has been seldom referred to in Christian literature.</S>
