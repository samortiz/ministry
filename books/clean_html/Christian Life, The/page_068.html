<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST'S DEATH AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS,<br>WITH WHICH THE SPIRIT HAS BEEN COMPOUNDED, BECOME PREVAILING IN THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Now we want to see the Spirit's application of Christ's death and its effectiveness. Christ's death and its effectiveness, with which the Spirit has been compounded, become prevailing in the Spirit. If Christ's death were not in the Spirit, His death could not be prevailing. If we enjoy and experience the Spirit, His death becomes prevailing in us. The death of Christ is in the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE COMPOUNDED SPIRIT<br>DWELLING IN OUR SPIRIT TO DISPENSE<br>CHRIST'S DEATH AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS<br>FROM OUR SPIRIT TO OUR SOUL<br>AND EVEN TO OUR MORTAL BODY</H2><P>The compounded Spirit dwells in our spirit to dispense Christ's death and its effectiveness from our spirit to our soul and even to our mortal body (Rom. 8:6, 9-10). This dispensing is the anointing (1 John 2:20, 27), and the anointing is the moving of the indwelling Spirit. Those Christians who love the Lord and maintain fellowship with the Lord, always have the feeling and sensation that something is moving within them. That moving is the anointing, and that anointing is the dispensing of the Triune God, of the death of Christ, and of the resurrection of Christ. That dispensing comprises all these elements: divinity, Christ's humanity, Christ's death, the effectiveness of His death, Christ's resurrection, and the power of His resurrection.</P><P>When we are under this dispensing, our natural life is killed, and our flesh is crucified. It is under this dispensing, this anointing, this moving of the indwelling Spirit, that we experience the death of Christ. When we are about to lose our temper, we may stop ourselves and go to pray. After our prayer, our anger is over. This is because our prayer activates the moving of the indwelling Spirit, and within this moving there is the killing power.</P>
