   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING SERIOUS AND DESPERATE TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we see that we have been charged by the Lord, we will have a heart to carry out a successful contact with the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must be serious, earnest persons.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We all have to do a job to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The sisters, as wives and mothers, have to take care of their households.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But if they have seen that they have been charged by the Lord, their hearts will not be fully occupied with their households.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although they take care of their responsibilities properly, their deep desire should be to go out to visit people with the gospel, to contact and gain sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord is hungry for sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In John 4 He told His disciples: "I have food to eat of which you have no knowledge" v. 32 . The Lord's food was to gain the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When He gained that immoral woman, she became His food.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That satisfied His hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We all must realize that the Lord is hungry and is waiting to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The lack of gospel preaching today in Christianity is shameful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christians may like to talk about many things in the Bible except fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 15 abiding is not merely for abiding.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Abiding is for fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus says, "Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes it away" v. 2 . To be taken away is to be cut off from the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians have already been cut off; they do not have the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some may say, "I have not brought one person to the Lord for six years, yet I enjoy the Lord very much."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is based upon their feelings, not upon the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fact is that they have not borne fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fruit-bearing is the real evidence that we genuinely enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His Word tells us clearly that if we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to realize that we have been charged by our Master, and then we must be serious and desperate to go forth, to bear fruit, and to keep our fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This depends upon the Lord's appointment in John 15:16.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This appointment indicates that He has prepared an environment to accommodate our every need so that we can bear remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord has prepared and arranged all of our situations so that we can carry out our appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verse 16 is like a mother telling her children, "I have cooked that you should eat."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they do not eat, they will miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today, many Christians are missing the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord has appointed; He has arranged everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Especially for those of us in the United States what a good appointment we have received!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have not been appointed to live alone on a high mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>People are everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, He has given many of us jobs for only eight hours a day, five days a week.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every evening we have three or four hours, and every weekend we have two days.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is according to the Lord's arrangement and appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In addition, the Lord has given us many relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is an environment and situation that is just right for us to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we meet the Lord, we will have no excuse because, by His appointment, He has prepared the environment with all the situations that we need for bearing fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The only problem is that we would not go forth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must take this very seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a matter of merely fulfilling our duty; it is a matter of life or death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must be serious, earnest, and desperate to go forth to gain people for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>PRAYING FOR THE SINNERS' SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To have a successful contact with sinners, we must be those who pray at all times 1 Thes 5:17; Luke 18:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While we are working, we must be praying for one or two of those with whom we work.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should pray: "Lord, remember these ones that I am burdened for.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You desire all men to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Remember them and visit them with Your salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must be persons who pray day and night without ceasing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's desire for man's salvation requires our prayer for it to be carried out 1 Tim 2:1, 4 .</S>
