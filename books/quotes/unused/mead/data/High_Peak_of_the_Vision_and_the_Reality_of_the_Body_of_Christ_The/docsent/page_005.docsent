   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TURNING OF THE LORD'S REVELATION AND VISION AND THE ARRIVING AT THE HIGH PEAK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Brother Nee the Lord's revelation and vision reached the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a wonderful coincidence that at about the time he went into prison in 1952, the Lord began to use me in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From 1950 to this day, it has been forty-four years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not blame me for speaking a proud word; I am not proud.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You know on what point I began in these forty-four years.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I began with Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many of the messages concerning these two points have been published in book form.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Among these a good number of the messages are on the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then a little over ten years ago, probably from 1980, the Lord showed me that in order to have the Body of Christ, the dispensing of Christ is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>So I began to speak concerning the dispensing of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If Christ does not dispense Himself into us, how can we become His Body?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that point I went higher and saw the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, beginning from 1984 I released many messages on the economy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then in the spring of this year actually I saw it last year I continued to go higher.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I saw that it is only by God's becoming man to make man God that the Body of Christ can be produced.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This point is the high peak of the vision given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually, early in the fourth century Athanasius, who was present at the Nicene Council, said that "He was made man that we might be made God."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At that time he was an unnoticed young theologian.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This word of his became a maxim in church history.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, later, gradually people in Christianity not only would not teach this but did not dare to teach this.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God is God, and He Himself has begotten us as His children.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever anything is born of, that is what it is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We cannot say that when sheep beget sheep, the old sheep are sheep but the little sheep are not sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since God has begotten us, we are the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, 1 John 3 says that God will work on us to such an extent that we will be like Him completely v. 2 . From the day God created man, this has been the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, what He created was man, yet He created man with the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Adam was created with God's image and likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then God set man before the tree of life, meaning that He wanted man, who had God's image, to receive God as his life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a result, if a man who has received God as his life is not God, then what is he?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the Lord also shows us clearly that we are God in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A father begets a son, and this son surely is the same as the father in life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Suppose the father is an emperor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We cannot say that all his children are emperors.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The children have only their father's life and nature but not his status; this is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God did this that He might produce a Body for Christ, that is, that He might produce an organism for the Triune God, the ultimate manifestation of which is the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the Chinese-speaking conference in February of this year, the brothers wanted me to speak, and my burden was to speak about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For twenty-seven years I had not written a new hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Several days before the Chinese-speaking conference I wrote a new hymn with four stanzas: What miracle!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What mystery!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That God and man should blended be!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God became man to make man God,</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Untraceable economy!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From His good pleasure, heart's desire,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His highest goal attained will be.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Flesh He became, the first God-man,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His pleasure that I God may be:</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In life and nature I'm God's kind,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Though Godhead's His exclusively.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His attributes my virtues are;</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His glorious image shines through me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>No longer I alone that live,</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But God together lives with me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Built with the saints in the Triune God,</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His universal house we'll be,</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And His organic Body we</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For His expression corp'rately.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jerusalem, the ultimate,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Of visions the totality;</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Triune God, tripartite man</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A loving pair eternally</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As man yet God they coinhere,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>A mutual dwelling place to be;</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God's glory in humanity</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Shines forth in splendor radiantly!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After singing this hymn, you can realize that it is a special hymn.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the two-thousand-year history of Christianity there is not one hymn that is of this category.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the unique hymn in this category of hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This hymn speaks very clearly concerning the high peak of God's vision.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today in the Lord's recovery, it is not that we will not preach the gospel anymore; but preaching the gospel is for begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>And it is not that we will not nourish the saints anymore or that we will not perfect the saints anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>All the begetting, nourishing, and perfecting are for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>However, what are we building?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Are we just building the local churches?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No. We are building the local churches for the building up of the Body of Christ, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then, does this mean that we just forget about the local churches?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>No. The local churches are the procedure for God to accomplish the building of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God still has to greatly use the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Thank the Lord, through this kind of fellowship I hope that we all know where we are today and also where we should be and what we should do.</S>
