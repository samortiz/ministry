of History in the Bible</h2>
<p>The history in the Bible contains spiritual meaning. For example, the history of Sarah and Hagar speaks of the difference between the old and new covenants (Gen. 21:1-14; Gal. 4:22-31), and the story of Mephibosheth describes God&rsquo;s salvation (2 Sam. 9:1-13).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Dispensations in the Bible</h2>
<p>We must distinguish among the different dispensations in the Bible. If we do not, many parts will seem contradictory and be difficult to explain. The period of time from the creation of Adam to the end of the millennial kingdom can be divided into seven dispensations. The position and condition of man and the responsibility borne by man in each dispensation are different. In each dispensation, however, man failed, and each dispensation ends in judgment.</p>
<p><strong>1. The dispensation of innocence</strong>&mdash;from the creation of Adam to his being driven out of the garden of Eden, at most 130 years (cf. Gen. 5:3).</p>
<p>This period is called the dispensation of innocence because man was without sin at the time of Adam&rsquo;s creation. Man lived before God and was ruled by God; God ruled man directly.</p>
<p><strong>2. The dispensation of conscience</strong>&mdash;from the fall of Adam to the flood. The dispensations of innocence and conscience span approximately 1,656 years.</p>
<p>This period is called the dispensation of conscience because man fell from God to his conscience and was ruled by his conscience. God ruled man indirectly through his conscience.</p>
<p><strong>3. The dispensation of human government</strong>&mdash;from Noah&rsquo;s leaving the ark to the dispersion at the tower of Babel, 427 years.</p>
<p>This period is called the dispensation of human government because during this time man fell further from his own conscience to being ruled by other men. He was under man&rsquo;s rule. God thus ruled man even more indirectly through other men. At this time God gave man authority to rule men (9:6). Man&rsquo;s authority over man began in this dispensation (Rom. 13:1). By this time man had fallen to the furthest extent. He fell from God to his conscience and then from his conscience to being ruled by other men. Thus, man fell from God&rsquo;s government to self government and from self government to human government. After man fell to this extent, he could fall no further. At this point, man truly needed God to come in and save him.</p>
<p><strong>4. The dispensation of promise</strong>&mdash;from Abraham&rsquo;s calling to the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, 430 years.</p>
<p>After man could fall no further, God came in and called Abram (Abraham), promising him that He would bless man through his seed&mdash;Christ (Gal. 3:16). This meant that He would deal with man by grace through Christ. God repeated this promise to the patriarchs. Therefore, this period is called the dispensation of promise.</p>
<p><strong>5. The dispensation of law</strong>&mdash;from the giving of the law on Mount Sinai to the ministry of John the Baptist, about 1,500 years (Luke 16:16).</p>
<p>Although God promised to deal with man by grace through Christ, man did not know himself. Instead, he thought that he could do good and be justified by God by virtue of his own actions. Therefore, God temporarily put aside His promise of grace and used the law to show man his sin and impotence. Through the law, man was shown that he could not do good nor be justified in himself so that he would seek God&rsquo;s grace. This period is called the dispensation of law because God dealt with man through the law at this time.</p>
<p><strong>6. The dispensation of grace</strong>&mdash;from the ministry of John the Baptist to Christ&rsquo;s second coming (Mark 1:1-5).</p>
<p>God used the law only to deal with man temporarily. His original promise of grace was not annulled by the law (Gal. 3:17). He placed man under law (for approximately 1,500 years) to completely manifest man&rsquo;s sin and impotence so that he would know himself and his sin in order to bow before God&rsquo;s judgment (Rom. 3:19-20). Then God sent the Lord Jesus to fulfill His promise of grace, enabling Him to deal with man through grace and enabling man to live under His grace. The law continued to the time of John the Baptist (Luke 16:16), but from that time until the second coming of Christ, God has dealt with man and will deal with man through grace. Therefore, this period is called the dispensation of grace.</p>
<p><strong>7. The dispensation of the kingdom</strong>&mdash;from Christ&rsquo;s coming to reign as King to the casting of Satan into the lake of fire, 1,000 years (Rev. 20:10).</p>
<p>When Christ comes back, the dispensation of grace will be over. His kingdom will be on earth, and He will reign for one thousand years. This period of one thousand years is the time of the authority of His kingdom, so it is called the dispensation of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Many Bible scholars use these seven periods. However, the Bible divides the time from the creation of Adam until the end of the millennial kingdom into only four dispensations:</p>
<p><strong>1. The dispensation of the fathers</strong>&mdash;from Adam to Moses, before the giving of the law (Rom. 5:13-14), 2,513 years.</p>
<p><strong>2. The dispensation of the law<strong>&mdash;from Moses to the first coming of Christ (John 1:17), about 1,500 years.</p>
<p><strong>3. The dispensation of grace</strong>&mdash;from the first coming of Christ to His second coming.</p>
<p><strong>4. The dispensation of the kingdom</strong>&mdash;from the second coming of Christ to the casting of Satan into the lake of fire, 1,000 years.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures, Vol. 3 &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
