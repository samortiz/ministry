   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPIRITUAL EDUCATION IN THE TRUTH BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SERVICE TO PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we desire to be useful to the Lord, we must learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Truth is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To preach the gospel, we need to learn the truth; to speak with others, we need to learn the truth; to help others, we also need to learn the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not know the truth, when people come to us with a problem concerning their marriage, we can only say, Our God is almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Pray and trust Him more.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He will definitely save you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If someone seeks our help concerning his business, we will also say, God is almighty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as you trust in Him, He will surely help you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Regardless of the person, matter, or situation, we will always give the same answer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What help can we render?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if we have sufficient knowledge of the truth, when people encounter a problem, we can speak to them according to the word of the truth that pertains to their particular problem.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can even strengthen the word with examples or experiences from the people in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we do this, we will render genuine help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should no longer use clich s to say things that do not even touch the point.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, when a sister has a problem with her husband, we should speak to her according to the word of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Afterward we should wait for her response and listen to what she says.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can then strengthen her by telling her the story of Ruth in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way she will receive help and be able to resolve the problem with her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If a brother speaks to us concerning his business, we should fellowship with him according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whether we can render genuine help to people depends on whether we are clear concerning the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we must have the spiritual education of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>MAKING A SCHEDULE AND</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>PRACTICING ACCORDING TO THE SCHEDULE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should make a schedule for the seven days of the week, that begins with rising in the morning and ends with going to bed in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The schedule should include our daily activities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because we have our own circumstances, we should make our own schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This schedule will naturally reflect the specifics of our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we love the Lord and pursue the Lord, we should make a schedule and practice according to our schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, we will not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Certain things must be included in our schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There must be a time to contact the Lord daily, whether it is five, ten, or fifteen minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should have a fixed time to have fellowship with the Lord daily.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In our contact with the Lord, we must confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Perhaps we have committed many sins unconsciously, yet we have no feeling concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when we fellowship with the Lord and He points out those matters and rebukes us, we should confess all the sins we are inwardly conscious of, one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should confess our sins every day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though we have confessed our sins in the morning, if we become weak before noon, we should confess our sins again at noontime.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Daily confession keeps our conscience pure and removes any barrier between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, we should constantly turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should say to the Lord, I truly believe in You.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You are the Spirit, and You are filling me inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Fill me now, Lord, like the air filling my whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should believe with our whole heart that the Lord lives in us and that what we speak through faith has authority, power, and boldness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our schedule must include these three things, and we must practice them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We must fellowship with the Lord daily, confess our sins, and ask the Lord to fill us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From today forward, we should endeavor to learn the truth, and we should exercise to have a schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not feel that this is difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We are absolutely sure that as long as we practice step by step according to our schedule, we will walk in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we practice these matters with persistence, considering them as part of our daily life, we will see the Lord s work.</S>
