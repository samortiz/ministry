In the first verse of the Bible in Genesis, God is revealed 'In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth'
The Gospel of John says that in the beginning was God, the Word, and the Word became flesh to dwell among us, full of grace and reality
In order to find Christ, we must come to the church, and the reality and practicality of the church are in the local churches
If you have the local church, you have the church; if you have the church, you have Christ; and if you have Christ, you have God
In other words God is expressed through Christ Christ is expressed through the church and the church is expressed through the local churches
By this life we have been regenerated, reborn, and by regeneration we have been produced as the members of the Body of Christ
Christ is the life of all the members of His Body, and eventually, this Body will be increased into the New Jerusalem
The river of life is simply the flowing of life, just as the current of electricity is the flowing of electricity
By death He was brought into resurrection, and through resurrection He finished the second step of His flowing
Now He is not merely able to be on this earth among human beings, but He is also able to enter into us, His believers
Now He is flowing in resurrection, and the way to receive Him is to drink Him in spirit by calling on His name 'O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus'
He flows into us, through us, and out of us to water the whole earth, to quench the thirst of all the needy ones
Romans 8:2 speaks of the Spirit of life, and 1 Corinthians 15:45b says that Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit
If you want to receive the flowing Triune God as your life, you have to open from the depths of your being to say, 'O Lord Jesus'
Water' was the central concept of the ministry of John the Baptist, that is, to terminate people of the old creation
There is the kingdom of man, the kingdom of humanity, and there is the kingdom of God, the kingdom of divinity
We all have been born into the kingdom of humanity, but we need to enter into the kingdom of divinity by being born again of God
We have entered into the kingdom of God by a new birth, by regeneration, by being born of water and the Spirit
John 3 goes on to tell us that Jesus would be lifted up just as the bronze serpent was lifted up by Moses in the wilderness
After He was resurrected, He came back to His disciples and breathed into them, telling them to receive the Holy Spirit
If you are really drinking of Christ, feeding upon Him, abiding in Him, and breathing Him in day by day, you will have the growth
To grow in life means to have the Spirit within you increasing all the time and the flesh without decreasing all the time
In other words, there is no American, Chinese, Canadian, Japanese, Mexican or any other race in the new man, but Christ is all and in all
All of us in our flesh are like ugly worms, but within us there is something beautiful, which is the spiritual, heavenly, divine 'butterfly'
The Lord came that we might have life for the purpose of producing the Body, and in the Body there is nothing old
The Father's teaching enlightens our mind that we may see the things in our concept and understanding that replace Christ
If we are going to know Christ and know the Father's intention, we must be submissive to take the Father's will
You may exercise to enjoy the Lord, yet you are not willing to be enlightened in your mind and subdued in your will
The proper drinking and eating of the Lord must be realized in the change of the mind and in a submissive and subdued will
If Christ is going to increase in you and you are going to decrease you need a change of mind in your concept and you need a submissive will
If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him'
In John 6 the mind is enlightened, in chapter seven the will is subdued, and in chapter fourteen the emotion is stirred up by the Lord
He did not rebuke Peter and tell him that his will was strong and stubborn and that some day his will would be subdued
The local church is not only a place where you can receive life but also a place where you can grow in life to be matured in life
The real growth in life is, positively, the increase of Christ within you, and negatively, the decrease of yourself
In John 1225 the Lord said He who loves his soullife loses it and he who hates his soullife in this world shall keep it unto eternal life
God's intention seen throughout the Bible is that man would receive Him as life to become His expression in this universe
Just as a glove was made in the image of a hand in order to contain a hand, man was made in the image of Christ in order to contain Christ
In the last two chapters of the Bible, the tree of life appears again, and it appears in a river, the river of water of life
Gold, pearl, and precious stone seen in Genesis 2 are for God's building, which is consummated in Revelation 21 and 22
In order for Eve to come into being, God put Adam to sleep and took a bone, a rib, out of his side, with which He built a woman
In the first two chapters of the Bible are the tree of life, the river, three kinds of precious material, and the bride
The first two chapters of the Bible, before Satan came in, are continued by the last two chapters of the Bible, after Satan is cast out
Today we are in the experience of Revelation 12, where there is a struggling between the old serpent and the wife, the woman
After the tree of life gets into you, there is a living river flowing within you and a spring of water within you gushing up all the time
By the tree of life with the flowing river, we men of clay, of dust, will be transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones
In Revelation 21 and 22 the gold, pearls, and precious stones are built together as one city, one bride, the consummation of the church
They think that the more doctrines they give people, the more the church will be built up, but this is not true
The first half of 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit, but the second half speaks of the Spirit of the Lord
Verses 7 through 9 say, 'If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him
The Lord showed him that He was one with the Father and even was the Father, because when you saw Him, you saw the Father
In the following portion of John 14, the Lord went on to say that another Comforter would come to abide within the disciples
After His resurrection the Lord came back to His disciples to be with them forever, thus not leaving them as orphans
God the Father is in Christ the Son, Christ the Son is realized as God the Spirit, and God the Spirit is within us
God the Father is within God the Son as the Lamb, and out of the throne of this Lamb-God flows God the Spirit as the river of water of life
It is a wrong concept to think that if we are properly instructed, corrected, and adjusted, we will be able to have the church life
Now this Wonderful One in three persons is indwelling the deepest part of our being, that is, our human spirit
The more the Triune God as the inner life flows within us, the more our whole being will be saturated with Him
In the verses referred to in the Scripture reading there are two main concepts the growth in life and the building up of the Body
Corinthians is a precious book which follows the book of Romans in God's sovereign arrangement of the books of the Bible
Chapter one tells us that we have been called into the fellowship, the participation, the enjoyment, of this wonderful One
For our past Christ is our righteousness; for our present He is our sanctification; and for our future destiny He is our redemption
According to our natural being, we are wood, grass, and stubble, but we are being transformed into precious material for God's building
We were reborn with gold, and we are being transformed into silver and precious stones by being watered and by our growth in life
1 Corinthians 3 shows us the planting, watering, growing, transforming, and the producing of precious material for God's building
We cannot organize a church, but we can plant and water so that God can go along with our ministry to give the growth in life
Ephesians 4 says that we need to hold Christ as the reality that we may grow up in all things into Christ as the Head
Colossians 2:19 says that the real building of the Body depends on the growth, and this growth comes from the growth of God
The growth of the Body of Christ has nothing to do with the doctrinal knowledge of the Bible, the way of worship, or any such matter
When Paul was defending himself before King Agrippa, the Roman politician Festus exclaimed, 'You are insane, Paul
We grow not by the increase of gifts, the increase of knowledge, or the increase of moral or ethical attainment
God's hand was upon him, not to do some outward correcting or adjusting work but to do an inner transforming work
One brother may consider in his mind about the other brother, thinking that this brother's attitude toward him has not been good
We also need to give Him the ground to take over our emotion so that our emotion can be filled with His desires and feelings
In chapter two we have to remember three things: the Lord of glory , the depths of God, and the mind of Christ
We are God's farm and God's building, and we are growing in life on God's farm to be produced as precious material for God's building
By growing and being transformed we become the gold, silver, and precious stones, and we are built up together to be the temple of God
All things, including the heavens and the earth with all the plants, animals, and human beings, are for the church
Surely we hate Satan and the demons, but in His sovereignty God uses even them for the building up of the church
The Corinthian believers foolishly said that they were of Paul and of Apollos, but Paul said that both he and Apollos were theirs
All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ , Christ is in the church, and the church is the center of the whole universe
Verse 4 says, 'In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus'
The apostle's spirit was so strong that his spirit was assembled with them to carry out his judgment upon an evil person
Verse 12 says For even as the body is one and has many members yet all the members of the body being many are one body so also is the Christ
Also, chapter eleven says that women can pray and prophesy , but chapter fourteen says that the women have to be silent
For 'the rest' we need to seek the Lord's leading, based on and governed by the principles set forth in the New Testament
In 1 Corinthians 16 Paul pointed out that certain faithful ones refreshed both his spirit and the spirits of all the saints
Still in his first Epistle you can see that he is a person behaving, acting, working, moving, and having his being in the spirit
If Paul had used the word and, that would mean that all the saints were standing on the same level as the church
If we are not in a local church, we do not have the proper standing, qualification, or position to understand it
His spirit was so strong that he attended the Corinthians' meeting in his spirit even though he could not be there physically
If we remain in the spirit, regardless of our environment or circumstances, we will be taken over by the Spirit and become different persons
The possibility for the church life is in our spirit, but the practicality of the church life is with our body
In 1 Corinthians 2 and 3 Paul deals with the spirit, the soul, and the flesh, and in chapter six he deals with our physical body
He has been made to us righteousness for our past, sanctification for our present, and redemption for our future
Finally, in chapter fifteen He is the firstfruits , the second man , the last Adam , and the life-giving Spirit
Today all the items of what Christ is are the elements the components of the lifegiving Spirit who dwells in our spirit to be our portion
In chapter one Paul said that the Corinthians had been enriched by Christ in everything, especially 'in all utterance and all knowledge'
The gifts are many in number, but at the end of chapter twelve Paul advised the Corinthians to earnestly desire the greater gifts
Whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease; or knowledge, it will be rendered useless'
If our love is merely out of our heart, that is a natural love, not the divine love which is the expression of Christ
In chapter fourteen Paul charges us, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy'
He said to pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, but he made clear that we need to desire the best gift, which is to prophesy
In chapter five Paul told the Corinthians that when they came together, he would meet with them, not in his body but in his spirit
In this assembly he judged a sinful person in the name of the Lord, in the spirit, and in power by delivering such a one to Satan
In chapter four Paul asked them whether he should come to them with a rod or in love and in a spirit of meekness
To be a spiritual man does not mean that you have the Holy Spirit descending on you in a miraculous way to speak in tongues
He said in chapter seven that he did not have the Lord's commandment, but as one who had obtained the Lord's mercy, he gave his opinion
If you have the gift of speaking in tongues without love, you are as sounding brass and a clanging cymbal, making empty sounds without life
In order to realize life, we have to learn how to exercise our spirit, because the essence of life is Christ Himself
Today Christ is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit, so we have to learn to walk, to behave, and to have our being in our spirit
If we enjoy Christ in the spirit and minister Christ to one another, the local church will be built up and there will be no division
Today we are in the age of the recovery of the local churches by Christ being enjoyed by us to be our nourishment for our growth in life
Now we want to compare what has been spoken concerning Christ in 1 Corinthians with what Paul said in 2 Corinthians
When the Lord met him on the road to Damascus, He said to Saul, 'It is hard for you to kick against the goads'
He went from city to city to preach Christ as one in the train of vanquished foes to celebrate the victory of Christ
While we are preaching, others should have the impression that we are captives in the celebrating train of vanquished foes
We have to be constrained to such an extent that we lose ourselves, forget about ourselves, and live to Christ
Christ was made sin for us to be judged and done away with by God that we might become God's righteousness in Christ
Someone may tell you to look at how gentle and meek Christ was on earth and that you need to learn of Him, but this does not work
Far, we have seen that we are the captives of Christ, the letters of Christ, the mirrors of Christ, and the vessels of Christ
At that time Paul had a thorn which was piercing him, troubling him, hurting him, and giving him pain all the time
Paul wanted this enjoyment along with the love of God and the fellowship of the Spirit to be with us in our experience
In 1 Corinthians we saw that there are four lines the line of Christ the line of the gifts the line of the spirit and the line of the church
Healings, miracles, speaking in tongues, interpretation of tongues, and knowledge are not mentioned in 2 Corinthians
The Lord did use Paul to perform some miracles, but the Lord would not perform a miracle to remove the thorn in his flesh
If the Lord changed this brother's wife, there would be no opportunity for him to experience the Lord as the sufficient grace
When we are in the elementary stage we may desire the gifts but when we are advanced in Christ we care for the deeper experiences of Christ
Everything in 2 Corinthians has been developed in a deeper way, and all of the outward teachings and gifts are over
If we mean business with the Lord and go along with the Lord, we will experience Him through sufferings, hardships, and trials
We can never be divided by the experience of Christ in the spirit, but it is easy to be divided by teachings and gifts
If we pay our attention to increasing the gifts, there is the danger that these increased gifts will become dividers to divide us
Chapter twelve speaks of the gifts of the Spirit and says that we have been baptized in the Spirit and are drinking of the one Spirit
When we consider all these aspects of the Spirit in 1 Corinthians, we can realize that they are mentioned with a lack of experience
We are being transformed into the glorious image of the Lord from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit
In our experience, how much we have been attached to Christ depends on the amount of anointing we have received
The anointing Spirit day by day anoints us with the ingredients and the constituents of God, the divine elements of God Himself
Day by day if we will simply walk and behave according to this anointing, God will be added into us, imparted into us, more and more
When people contact you, they will have the sense that with you there is the image of God and something of God formed within you
He has not only imparted His elements into us but has also impressed us with His own image with the form of the living Spirit
God gives His Spirit to us as a foretaste of what we will inherit of God, affording us a taste beforehand of the full inheritance
We taste the Spirit as a foretaste, and this is a sample of the full taste of the Spirit to come on a greater scale
The more we experience the Spirit in such a hidden, deep, high, rich, and inner way, the more we will be delivered from being divisive
The more we experience the gifts in an outward way and the more doctrinal teachings we receive, the more puffed up and divisive we will be
There should be something living within us all the time as evidence that Christ is being written into every part of our inner being
We need to always return to our spirit because it is in our spirit that we sense and experience the imparting of life
They needed to take away all the veils, which means that they had to get rid of their old knowledge of the written code
The Holy Spirit anoints us with the divine essence, just like a painter paints a house with the essence of paint
The anointing brings in the essence, and the sealing shapes what the anointing brings in into a definite form and image
The sealing Spirit follows to make this substance into a form so that we have the image, impression, and likeness of God
Following this the Spirit becomes the pledge the foretaste the earnest the down payment the first installment the sample for us to taste
The Pharisees, the scribes, and the Jewish leaders at Jesus' time knew all the right doctrines in the Old Testament
The magi, however, went to contact Christ, not just according to the right teaching but according to the living star
The Lord Jesus told the Jewish religionists that they researched the Bible, but they would not come to Him for life
People may be bothered at the noise in our meetings, but the Bible tells us to make a joyful noise to the Lord
The Christian life and the church life are not a matter of what is right or wrong, but a matter of what is dead or living
In John 5:21 the Lord said, 'For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills'
Many times when you try to study the Bible, you are deadened because you get a lot of doctrinal knowledge without life
Balaam's donkey received the gift of speaking in a human language, of speaking in tongues, but that was not a ministry
A ministry is produced in a person because Christ has been wrought into him for many years, not just overnight
When you experience Christ through sufferings, the ministry of Christ with you is enriched, strengthened, and uplifted
Paul ministered Christ so richly because something of Christ had been wrought into him and built into him to become one with him
If you listen to certain speakers, you may feel that you only receive knowledge without anything watering or feeding you
You may listen to someone who is not so eloquent, yet you have the deep feeling that you are nourished, watered, and vivified
The Lord said that all that the Father is and has was given to Him, and whatever He received was passed on to the Spirit of reality
We need to be unloaded and emptied so that we can freshly receive Christ Himself in the newness of His living presence
When we have an unveiled face, we are liberated from religion, old doctrines, and traditions to behold and reflect the living Christ
As we behold Christ face to face, we mirror Him, and we are being transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree
We have pointed out that the aspects of the Spirit mentioned in 2 Corinthians are different from those mentioned in 1 Corinthians
The oil is composed of only one element, the element of the olive, but the ointment is composed of oil plus a number of elements
The compound ointment is composed of one basic element, olive oil, blended and compounded together with four kinds of spices
The Old Testament gives us the pictures, whereas the New Testament gives us the definition and description of these pictures
The olive oil is the base, and it is mixed, blended, and compounded with four spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia
From these numbers we can see that both humanity and divinity are compounded in the Spirit of God, the heavenly olive oil
One signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of the Lord's death; the other signifies the precious resurrection of Christ
As we have seen, three is the number of the Godhead, and there are three units of five hundred shekels in the ointment
The second unit of five hundred shekels is split in half, indicating that the Second of the Divine Trinity was split on the cross
Three the number of the Triune God and five the number of responsibility the number of God added to man are the numbers of Gods building
Verses 14 and 15 say that the hangings on either side of the gate were to be fifteen cubits with three pillars and three sockets
The tabernacle could never have been a divine building until every part of it was anointed with the holy compound ointment
The building of God is established and built up by the anointing of the compound ointment, the compound Spirit
In this ointment there is the effectiveness of Christ's death to kill all the divisive germs and negative things within our being
We know how the Son, who had from eternity been with the Father, entered upon a new stage of existence when He became flesh
The Holy Spirit could come down as the Spirit of the God-man most really the Spirit of God, and yet as truly the spirit of man
He is the Spirit not merely with divinity but the Spirit both of God and of man with a renewed, uplifted, developed, new holy human nature
We have seen that all the parts of the tabernacle with all its contents were not holy until they were anointed
The word sanctify means to join something with God, to make something have the divine essence and nature of God
All of the priests as well as the entire tabernacle with all of its parts were under the anointing of the compound ointment
Without this anointing, none of them could have been holy, that is, none of them could have been attached to God, joined to God
Under the anointing of the compound Spirit, there is the dwelling place of God, the church life, the priesthood, and the real serving body
Regardless of how perfect you are, if you are not one with God and if God is not one with you, you are not holy
Romans 10 says that there is no need to go to the heavens to bring Christ down or to go to the abyss to bring Christ up
He has become the living word, the Spirit, to be in our mouth like the air, the breath, that can be taken into our being
According to the priestly service in the tabernacle, the priests had to light the lamp and then burn the incense
We have to turn away from the doctrinal teachings and cleave ourselves to calling upon the name of the Lord that we may be anointed
Similarly, if we are anointed with the Spirit continually, everyone will be clear that we belong to God, because we will be His expression
The more we are anointed, the more we have the mark of the Spirit as the living seal, causing us to bear God's image
The more we are anointed, the more we receive the pledge, the guarantee, the enjoyment, the foretaste, of the Spirit
If we are going to have a proper church life, to be built up together, and to serve the Lord as the priesthood, we need the anointing
The result is the building up of the tent of meeting, the dwelling place of God, and the priesthood in today's church life
The lines of Christ, the spirit, and the church in 2 Corinthians are spoken of in a very deep and subjective way
We want to continue our fellowship on the line of the spirit in 2 Corinthians, the line of the divine Spirit with the human spirit
We have pointed out that there are nine aspects of the wonderful, all-inclusive, divine Spirit in 2 Corinthians
In chapter three there are another five aspects: the writing, life-giving, Christ-ministering, liberating, and transforming aspects
No doubt, the apostle Paul wrote 2 Corinthians with the thought of these eight aspects of the deeper work of the all-inclusive Spirit
The more we are anointed, painted, with the compound Spirit, the more the elements of Christ's person and work are dispensed into our being
God anoints us paints us with Himself for the purpose of transforming us to make us the real sons of our Father with the image of the Father
We may be taught much about the death of Christ, but what we need is the substance and reality of the death of Christ itself
When we are about to lose our temper, we can call on the Lord's name, and the killing power of Christ's death is there to kill our temper
The more that we try to reckon ourselves dead, the more we will be defeated, because this reckoning is the exercise of the mind
When we forget about the exercise of the mind and exercise our spirit by calling on the name of the Lord, we touch the compound Spirit
The anointing becomes the sealing within us , giving us the mark and the impression of the image of God to show that we belong to God
He transmits all the heavenly things and elements of Christ into us not for our mental knowledge but for us to taste, to enjoy
We need to be those who are continually tasting the heavenly, spiritual, eternal things by the compound Spirit
In 2 Corinthians 1:21 the apostle Paul said that God was the One who 'firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us'
After the compounding of the ointment in Exodus 30, God told Moses to anoint all the parts of the tabernacle and Aaron and his sons
We are assuming the position and function of priests because we have been attached to Christ, the anointed One
We have become the priests of the divine priesthood because we have been attached to the Head Priest, and we have been anointed by God
The anointing is the painting of all that Christ is, all that He has done, and all that He has attained into our being
Paul was anointed, so he was an apostle; the Corinthians had been inscribed with the Spirit, so they were the letters
The Spirit as the compound ink adds the substance of Christ into us and saturates us with the essence of Christ
The more we are written on with the heavenly compound Spirit, the more we receive the essence of the life of Christ
He transforms us, not by correcting or adjusting us, but by putting more and more of the life essence of Christ into us
We have the life power of Christ to shape us with His life essence so that we can be shaped into His life form
As an illustration, the life power of the peach life shapes the peach with its life essence to produce the form of a peach
One day we will come into full blossom, and that will be the glorification and manifestation of the sons of God
That freedom of the manifestation and glorification of the sons of God will be the consummation of our transformation
Finally, we need to experience the ministry of the Spirit and enjoy Him as the liberating and transforming One
Corinthians speaks about the human spirit, but the second Epistle speaks about the human spirit in a deeper way
In our service to the Lord, He may open a door for us to go on, yet we may feel deep within that we have no rest
Some may say that they have a door widely opened to them in the mission field, but do they have the rest within?
You may argue that the door has been opened by the Lord for you, but you still have an inner strain and feel bound within
Your arguing in a vindicating way is according to the consideration in your mind, not according to the registration in your spirit
To argue may give you a certain kind of pleasure, but you lose the Lord's presence; you do not have the rest with the Lord
As the saints are functioning in the meeting, you may say to yourself things like this: 'This one is too poor'
In 2 Corinthians 6 Paul said that he and his co-workers commended themselves as ministers of God 'in a holy spirit'
In the next chapter Paul said that we have to purify ourselves from all defilement of the flesh and of the spirit
We can be defiled in our spirit not just with outwardly sinful things but with something which is right, but other than God
In 2 Corinthians 7:13 Paul said, 'We rejoiced more abundantly over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you'
Many times when you are with a certain brother or sister, after a while you feel the refreshment in your spirit
If you are in a certain kind of trouble or trial, someone may sympathize with you and say something good to you
We need to refresh others' spirits; we need to have our own spirit refreshed by others; and we need to be joyful in others' refreshment
As we have pointed out, 2 Corinthians is an improvement over the first book in the experience of Christ, in the spirit, and in the church
We all must improve from knowing the church in a general way or a socalled universal way to knowing it in a local specific and practical way
Many Christian teachers have spoken many messages and have written many expositions on the book of Ephesians regarding the church
In 2 Corinthians 1:1, the church is mentioned in the singular number, but that is the church which is at Corinth, not in the universe
In chapter sixteen there is the church, while in chapter eighteen there is the church in a locality, the church to which you can go
In the book of Acts, we see the growing up of this seed into all the local churches the church at Jerusalem , the church at Antioch , etc
The book of 1 Corinthians tells us something about the local church, but it is not very extensive, and it is mostly in the way of teaching
The lab is where the lecture is put into practice, and it is certainly an improvement, practically speaking, upon the lecture
Timothy could be on the same level as the apostle Paul, but the saints could not be on the same level as the church
In one city there could be one church; but in one province there must be many churches, because in one province there are many cities
The church in Los Angeles may praise you, but what about the church in San Francisco and the church in Sacramento?
In a sense, each of the churches is local in its administration, but we need to realize that all the churches should be one
We are not unified or organized to be one, but if we mean business to practice the real church life, all the local churches will be one
It is not just a matter between you and the Lord, nor between you and your local church, but between you and the local churches
In the church life you cannot tell a brother to his face that he is good, and then behind his back say that he is not good
Sometimes, as the leading ones, it is necessary to speak, not with the intent of criticizing, but with the burden of bearing responsibility
In the beginning of this century, the Lord recovered something more, that is, the spiritual principles, the spirituality, of the church
Eventually, those who see the spirituality of the church criticize the matter of the practicality of the church
Christ is our righteousness for the past, our sanctification for the present, and our redemption for the future
Because he had experienced the comfort of Christ through much affliction, he had this comfort with which he could comfort others
Paul said that they were always being put to death and that in their body they bore the putting to death of Jesus
The apples produced by the apple tree come from the growth in life, and the growth in life is experienced through sufferings
We have the foretaste for our enjoyment today, and we are waiting for the full sonship, which is the redemption of our body
In chapter eleven he commended himself as a minister of Christ by speaking of his sufferings in following the Lord
Many of you young brothers and sisters love the Lord, but be assured that the way you are taking is the way of suffering
In 2 Corinthians 6:8 Paul said that he commended himself as a minister of God not only through a good report but also through an evil report
With the apostle Paul there were the evil reports, and if we are following the Lord in an absolute way, our experience will be the same
Paul said that his commendation was 'through glory and dishonor, through evil report and good report; as deceivers and yet true'
In verse 9 Paul said, 'As unknown and yet well known; as dying and yet behold we live; as being disciplined and yet not being put to death'
The apostles were unknown in the sense of not displaying themselves, but well known in the sense of witnessing to the truth of God
On the one hand, the apostles were dying in suffering persecutions, but on the other hand, they were living in the Lord's resurrection
In verse 10 Paul said, 'As made sorrowful yet always rejoicing; as poor yet enriching many; as having nothing and yet possessing all things'
It is through this way of suffering that a ministry will be produced with you so that you can really minister Christ to others as life
When he came to chapter twelve he spoke of a thorn in his flesh, which refers to a very subjective, physical suffering in his body
Paul did not consider himself to be a preacher or an expositor but a minister of Christ, dispensing Christ as life to others
If we forget about the gifts and pay our full attention to the ministry of life, we will always be kept in oneness
If you are a Christian worker and you are always trying to argue with others, this proves that you merely have a gift
If you are really in the hand of the Lord, the Lord will form a ministry with you through all kinds of sufferings
Through the suffering, Paul experienced the Lord as the sufficient grace, which was the perfect power in his weakness
Another may be awkward in his speech but you realize that there is something weighty with what he speaks because he has the ministry of life
We all need to continue in the growth in life that we may have more ministries among us for the building up of the church
