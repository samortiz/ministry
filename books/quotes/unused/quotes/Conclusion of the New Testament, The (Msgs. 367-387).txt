In redemption He accomplished the purification of man's sins and is now sitting on the right hand of God in the heavens
The Old Testament was of the law in letters and forms, of man, earthly, temporary, and by sight and issued in a religion called Judaism
The New Testament is of life, spiritual, heavenly, permanent, and by faith and is focused in a person who is the Son of God
Christ, the Son of God, is God Himself as well as the Lord; hence, He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth
As the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Christ is the origination and the source of all the created things
As creatures, the angels are much inferior to the Son, and as the Creator, the Son is much superior to the angels
The universe refers not only to the heavens and the earth but also to all the ages in the heavens and the earth
These ages did not take place merely by human development or natural evolution; rather, they were founded, instituted, by Christ
If there were only the heavens, the earth, and all things, without the succession of ages, then no events could have happened
God the Father in the Son and through the Spirit needed to make the universe in order to impart Himself in His trinity into us
Verse 10 says, 'You in the beginning, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands'
Since Christ is not only the Son of God but also the Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is His possession
Christ, as typified by Isaac, the son of Abraham, will inherit the earth , the kingdom , the throne , and all things
Since He is not only the Son of God but also the legal Heir of God, all that God the Father is and has is for His possession
Separating the effulgence from the glory may be likened to separating the shining of the sun from the rays of the sun
Just as the sun can reach us by the shining of its rays, Christ, the Son of God, is God Himself reaching us and coming into us
When God speaks, life is imparted, and this life includes all the divine attributes and human virtues of Christ
In the Old Testament, God spoke in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets, in men borne by His Spirit
Now at the last of these days, that is, in the New Testament age, God has spoken to us in the Son, in the person of the Son
The evil intention of the Jewish religionists was to terminate the Son of God, Jesus of Nazareth, by crucifying Him
After His crucifixion, the Lord entered into the realm of resurrection, and in resurrection He became the Head of the Body
Before His crucifixion and resurrection, the Lord Jesus was restricted by the flesh; it was not possible for Him to be universal
On the day of Pentecost Christ came down as the all-inclusive Spirit upon His disciples to make them members of His Body
Now, just as our whole body speaks whenever we speak, so the Body of Christ speaks whenever Christ speaks as the Head
In the four Gospels the Son came to speak God, not only with clear words but also with what He was and what He did
God speaks in the Son, the Son becomes the speaking Spirit, and the speaking Spirit is one with the church speaking for God
God speaks in the Son, the Son speaks as the Spirit to the churches, and ultimately, the Spirit speaks with the church
In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son of God who is better than the angels
Christ made purification of sins and sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high until God makes His enemies a footstool for His feet
Christ is sitting at the right hand of God until God makes all His enemies and adversaries serve Christ as a footstool for His rest
The book of Hebrews stresses the fact that Christ has accomplished everything for God and us, leaving nothing for us to do
John 3:16, a verse familiar to every Christian, says that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son
After His resurrection, since the many sons of God have been produced, He became God's firstborn Son with many brothers
He had the divine nature-that was the Son of God-but He also put on the human nature-that was not the Son of God
When He brings again the Firstborn into the inhabited earth, He says, 'And let all the angels of God worship Him'
In other words, when God brought Christ to earth the first time, He came in His status as the only begotten Son of God
In such a status He became the Son of Man in His incarnation and as the Son of Man He was begotten to be the Son of God in His resurrection
Hebrews 1:4 speaks of Christ 'having become as much better than the angels as to have inherited a more distinguished name than they'
Romans 1:4 says that Christ 'was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead'
In God's economy Christ is the One appointed by God to accomplish God's plan, and we are Christ's partners in the divine interest
We should remember our status as Christ's partners and declare that we are partners of Christ in His great enterprise
God the Spirit poured Himself out as the anointing oil upon this appointed Heir, anointing Him to be the operator of God's divine operation
We are not only the partakers of Christ who enjoy Him but also the partners of Christ who share in His operation
In God's economy, Christ is the Heir appointed by God, and in verse 9 we see that this appointed Heir has been anointed
Verse 8 says, 'Of the Son, 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom'
The throne is under Him, and the scepter of the kingdom, which signifies the authority of the kingdom, is in His hand
According to 1:14, as the heirs of salvation, we are much superior to the angels, for the angels are our servants, and we are their masters
Hebrews 2:5 says, 'It was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak'
Psalm 2:8 says that God has given to Christ the nations to be His inheritance and the limits of the earth as His possession
Revelation 11:15 says, 'The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever'
In other words, God never ordained the angels, but instead ordained man, to rule over the earth in the coming age
According to the Bible, at the time of creation God determined that man should exercise His authority over the earth
God has ordained man to rule over the earth because God needs a realm, a sphere, a dominion, in which He can exercise His authority
Without such a dominion in which He can exercise His authority, it would be difficult for God to express His glory
We should consider the conclusion of the Lord's prayer: 'For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory'
The writer of Hebrews argues in this way: 'It was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth, concerning which we speak'
These verses refer to Genesis 1, which tells us that God set Adam, the man created by God, over the works of God's hands
While He was with Martha and Mary in Martha's home, He could not be with others who were staying elsewhere at that time
The man Jesus, in the fulfillment of the prophecy in Psalm 8, was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death
He took on a physical make-up that was inferior to that of the angels for the purpose of suffering death for us
The whole creation needs to be freed from the slavery of corruption, so the whole creation needs Christ's redemption
Christ died on the cross for all the items of the creation so that He could reconcile all these items back to God
Because we human beings are sensitive and have strong feelings, we are very concerned about and threatened by death
The Greek word translated destroy in Hebrews 214 may also be rendered bring to nought make of none effect do away with abolish annul discard
After the devil, the serpent, seduced man into the fall, God promised that the seed of woman would come to bruise the head of the serpent
Death has been abolished; Satan, who holds the power of death, has been destroyed; and we have been released from slavery
Because of the allinclusive crucifixion of Christ there is no more death no more sin no more devil no more fear of death and no more slavery
Now through experience we realize that death sin the devil the fear of death and slavery were all truly crossed out in Christs crucifixion
After resurrection Christ was glorified, not only in the manifestation of His divine nature but also in the ascension into God's glory
We saw Him on the cross on earth with the crown of thorns, but now we see Him on the throne in heaven crowned with glory and honor
From the earthly viewpoint, it was an ascension from man, but from the heavenly viewpoint, it was an exaltation by God
After Christ had been crowned with glory and honor in His ascension, God gave Him the dominion over all things in His exaltation
Adam lost the dominion that God gave to him, but according to the prophecy of Psalm 8, Christ recovered what Adam lost
We were born in the first man and lost everything with him, but since we have been reborn in the second man, we have regained everything
The second man has been glorified, crowned with glory and honor, and entrusted with the divine dominion that was lost by the first man
On the one hand, He already was the Lord because He was God; on the other hand, in His humanity He was crowned to be the Lord of all
The anointed One is the appointed One, and the appointed One is the One who runs God's universal corporation, Christ and the church
The Greek word for Leader, translated 'Prince' in the King James Version, is the same Greek word that is rendered 'Author' in Hebrews 2:10
In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the Son of Man who is better than the angels
The writer of Hebrews mentions suffering because at the time this Epistle was written the Hebrew Christians were suffering
For this reason, He called them brothers, declared the Father's name to them, and sang hymns of praise unto God the Father
According to John 20, the resurrected Christ as the firstborn Son of God came to meet with the disciples as His brothers
Both the firstborn Son and the many sons of God are born of the same Father God in resurrection and have the same divine life and nature
The Firstborn can sanctify us because He, like us, has two natures and because we have the same natures that He has
The firstborn Son declared the Father's name to His brothers after He resurrected from the dead, when He met with the Father's many sons
The church mentioned in Hebrews 2:12 is referred to as a corporate composition of the many brothers of the firstborn Son of God
He was the one grain of wheat falling into the ground, dying, and growing up to bring forth many grains, which we are
He was the one grain, and we are now the many grains, His many brothers, brought forth by Him in His resurrection
In His resurrection Christ not only brought forth many brothers but also came to His brothers and declared to them the Father's name
In his second Epistle Peter says that we are partakers of the divine nature having received all things which relate to life and godliness
We have received the divine nature, and all things pertaining to life have been given to us because we were all born of the Father
On the day of resurrection the Lord came to them to declare the Father to make them know the Father as the source of life
According to that prophecy, after His resurrection Christ came mainly to His disciples to make the Father known to them
In resurrection Christ not only declared the Father's name to His brothers but also praised the Father in the church
Individually speaking, they are His brothers, and collectively speaking, they are the church brought forth in His resurrection
In the church meeting the Lord not only declared the Fathers name to His brothers but He also praised the Father in the midst of the church
When we, the many sons of God, meet as the church and praise the Father, the firstborn Son praises the Father in our praising
It is not that He praises the Father apart from us and alone; rather, He praises within us and with us through our praising
The more we sing to the Father, the more we enjoy His presence, His moving, His anointing, and His life-imparting within us
As Matthew 18:20 tells us, where there are two or three gathered into the Lord's name, there He is in their midst
Throughout all the centuries the firstborn Son has been continually singing hymns of praise unto the Father in the church
The more we praise the Father in the church meetings, the more He praises the Father in our praising, and the more we enjoy Him and gain Him
The positive purpose is to be our merciful and faithful High Priest who has the human nature, that He may sympathize with us in all things
The first two chapters of Hebrews mainly cover two points-that Christ is the Son of God, God Himself, and the Son of Man, man Himself
We may even say that He is more than like us, for He suffered in His human life some things that we have not suffered
In order to be qualified to be a merciful High Priest, He became like us, sympathizing with all of our weaknesses
Although, as the many sons of God and as the many brothers of the Firstborn, we are divine as well as human, we are not almighty
Our High Priest, Jesus Christ, the Son of God and the Son of Man, is both merciful and faithful because He is both God and man
The Lord Jesus made propitiation for our sins to reconcile us to God by satisfying God's righteous demands on us
Chapter 1 says that Christ is at the right hand of God, but chapter 2 says that Christ is with the children whom God has given to Him
We see these two titles of Christ in 3:1 where we are told to 'consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus'
As the Apostle, Christ came to us with God to share God with us that we might partake of His life, nature, and fullness
As the High Priest, Christ went to God with us to present us to God that we and all our case might be fully cared for by Him
He was sent by God to bring God to man, to impart God into man, and to dispense all that the Triune God is into God's chosen people
Hebrews 3:5 says, 'Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken later'
Hebrews 2:17 tells us that He is faithful as the High Priest, whereas 3:2 tells us that He is faithful as the Apostle sent from God to us
Christ builds up the church by bringing us through the soulish life into our spirit where He abides as the rest, the good land
Our concept may be that God sent Christ to us as an Apostle greater than Moses in order only to take care of our needs
He is the foundation stone , the cornerstone , the topstone , and the living stone to produce us as living stones
Moses was an apostle sent from God to constitute God's house on earth, and Christ is also the Apostle doing the same thing
In Old Testament times the house of God was the house of Israel , symbolized by the tabernacle or the temple, which was in Israel's midst
The Greek word rendered 'house' may be translated as 'household,' or using the modern term folks, the members of a family
Where the house of God is, there is the family of God, and where the family of God is, there is God the Father with His life and reality
Christ is not separate from all the members of the Body, for as the Head of the Body, Christ indwells all the members
We may enjoy Him in other aspects, for He is great, kind, and very merciful, and He will do many things for us
In order to enjoy Christ and know Him, we must realize that He is our Builder and that we are a part of the house of God
Verses 8 and 9 continue saying For if Joshua had brought them into rest He would not have spoken concerning another day after these things
Although thousands of Christians have been saved, so many of them remain in the wilderness; they have never entered into the good land
The house of God under the care of the Son of God is our rest, home, homeland, land of Immanuel, and good land flowing with milk and honey
Not only is He walking among the churches, but as Revelation 2 and 3 reveal, He is the Spirit speaking to the churches
In Hebrews 4 through 7, we see that Christ is the One better than Aaron, who as a high priest is a type of Christ
The Christ who is in the Holy of Holies is not merely our Savior, Redeemer, Apostle, or Captain of salvation; He is our High Priest
He also wore the breastplate in which were set twelve precious stones engraved with the names of the children of Israel
Of removing that thorn, the Lord imparted Himself into Paul as grace, enabling the apostle to know how precious and sufficient He is
We should not be content to remain as outer-court Christians; neither should we be Christians staggering in the Holy Place
Romans 8:34 says that Christ is at the right hand of God interceding for us, and Romans 8:10 says that Christ is also within us
There are not two Christs, one in the heavens and one within us; neither is it a matter of one Christ at two different times
Just as the electricity in the power plant is joined to our homes, so the Christ in the third heaven is joined to our spirit
Hebrews 4:14 says, 'Having therefore a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God'
Verse 11 of chapter 9 speaks of Christ as a High Priest of the good things; 10:21 speaks of Christ as the great Priest over the house of God
He not only knows the things of God and the things of man; He also is in the things of God and the things of man
He has given us the Sabbath rest in the church age, and He will bring us into the Sabbath rest of the kingdom age
His attainment is so high that He entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and was crowned with glory and honor
He is no longer on earth bearing the crown of thorns; He is now in the highest heavens wearing the crown of glory
Our High Priest, Christ, who is great in His person, qualification, work, accomplishment, and attainment, has passed through the heavens
After He was crucified and before He was resurrected, Christ walked through Hades, having a good sightseeing tour
Although Satan and all the powers of death tried to hold Him, at the time of His resurrection, He rose from the grave
Hebrews 7:26 says that 'such a High Priest was also fitting to us, holy, guileless, undefiled, separated from sinners'
As the One who has been tried in all respects like us, our High Priest, Christ, is able to sympathize with our weaknesses
He is easily touched with the feeling of our weaknesses and quickly enters into a fellow-suffering with us in our weaknesses
Though not encompassed with weakness like the high priest taken from among men Christ as our High Priest was tempted in all respects like us
Being touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, He is able to exercise compassion toward us, the ignorant and erring ones
We will meet Christ in our spirit, be in His presence, and experience Him as the High Priest who sympathizes with our feeling all the time
Verses 4 and 5 say, 'No one takes the honor upon himself, but only as he is called by God, just as Aaron also was
He did not glorify Himself to become a High Priest; He was ordained by God in His resurrection, according to the order of Melchizedek
In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the One better than Aaron
According to Hebrews 5:6, God says to Christ, 'You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek'
Hebrews 5:6, a quotation from Psalm 110, says, 'You are a Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek'
Melchizedek ministered bread and wine to Abraham, and the Lord Jesus ministered bread and wine to His disciples
Although Melchizedek was a king, he did not come as a king but as the priest of the Most High God, coming to Abraham with bread and wine
He was processed on the cross that He might be our life supply with the redeeming wine to quench our thirst under God's condemnation
According to the book of Hebrews, Christ offered Himself as the unique sacrifice for sin and solved the problem of sin once for all
He brought His blood into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and sprinkled it in the presence of God, thereby accomplishing redemption
It unveils Christ who no longer is only a Redeemer offering the sacrifice for sin to God and shedding His blood for our sins
The Christ revealed in this book is also the One who, after accomplishing redemption, comes to us in a mysterious way in our spirit
It is an endless life, being the eternal, divine, uncreated, resurrection life that has passed through the test of death and Hades
We know that this life is indestructible because it has been tested by everything and by every kind of situation
According to the type in the Old Testament, God's people were weak and sinful, under the conviction that they could do nothing to please God
The power of an indestructible life is the eternal Spirit, and the eternal Spirit is the reality of resurrection
Christ, our High Priest, is actively taking care of our case in the heavens and transmitting Himself into our spirit
We must come simply and boldly to the throne of grace to contact Him, to look to Him, to receive mercy, and to find grace for timely help
As the only begotten Son and the firstborn Son of God, Christ became the High Priest with the taking of an oath by God
Although in His divinity Christ was the Son of God, in His humanity He learned obedience through His sufferings
Such an eternal salvation is not limited by time and space but is all-embracing with the divine element and nature
The person of Christ as our High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek is the source of our eternal salvation
As our Melchizedek, the source of eternal salvation, He ministers Himself to us as bread and wine, and we eat and drink of Him
May we all be helped to see that the table symbolizes that our Christ today is our Melchizedek who ministers to us the bread and the wine
In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the One better than Aaron
According to Genesis 14, after Abraham defeated God's enemies, Melchizedek came to meet Abraham, bringing out bread and wine
At the Lord's table meeting, Christ as Melchizedek comes to us with the processed Triune God as bread and wine for our enjoyment
It must have been through his intercession that Abraham was able to slaughter the four kings and gain the victory
After we have finished our slaughter of the kings, our Melchizedek will come to us, meet with us, and celebrate our victory
Christ will be made manifest by our slaughter of the kings, and the whole world will be surprised at His coming
To the overcomers, Christ's second appearing will not be a surprise, but to the worldly people it will be a great surprise
Our victory gains the spoils, and the offering of our spoils to Christ always declares the greatness of Christ
According to verse 2 Melchizedek is interpreted as the king of righteousness and he is mentioned as the king of Salem which is king of peace
Melchizedek was also the king of Salem, which means the king of peace, signifying that Christ is also the King of peace
The first time that the Bible speaks of the priesthood, it tells of a wonderful person who was the king of peace
In Genesis 14:20 Melchizedek said, 'Blessed be God the Most High, / Who has delivered your enemies into your hand'
According to Genesis 14:22, before Abraham went out to fight the battle, he lifted up his hand to the Most High God
After Abraham had slaughtered the enemies and Melchizedek had come to meet him, there was righteousness and peace
As we previously pointed out, while Abraham was slaughtering Chedorlaomer and the other kings, Melchizedek must have been praying
As we are fighting during the day, slaughtering the negative things, Christ, the High Priest, is interceding for us
It was in such an environment and condition of righteousness and peace that Melchizedek ministered the bread and wine to the victor
We have righteousness and peace, but righteousness and peace alone cannot satisfy us; we need something to eat and drink
Based upon God's righteousness and peace, our Melchizedek ministers the bread and wine for us to eat and drink
While the Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin, the kingly priesthood ministers God to us, as our enjoyment for our daily supply
When we mention God, we must think of Him as the One who has been processed and imparted to us to be our daily supply
In God's eternal plan, God intended to dispense Himself into man to be man's everything so that man might become His complete expression
Because of man's fall, sin came in to frustrate and damage God's purpose of ministering Himself into man as man's daily supply
The Aaronic priesthood solves the problem of sin, whereas the kingly priesthood fulfills God's eternal purpose
Unlike us, Christ is presented as One who has no human father or mother, no genealogy, no beginning of days or end of life
He whose genealogy is not counted from them has taken tithes from Abraham and has blessed him who has the promises
When Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek, the Levitical priests, who as descendants of Abraham were in his loins, also paid tithes to him
All the Levitical priests are lesser than Melchizedek, and the order of Aaron is inferior to that of Melchizedek
In this message we will continue to consider the experience and enjoyment of Christ as the One better than Aaron
He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him, since He lives always to intercede for us
He appears before God on our behalf and prays for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
Because He lives forever without any change, Christ is able to save us to the uttermost in extent, in time, and in space
Offering solves the problem of sin, ministering imparts the processed God to us as our daily supply, and saving rescues us to the uttermost
At this point, we need to consider why there is the need for the third aspect of the priesthood, the divine priesthood
According to the broadest understanding of death in the Bible, death includes vanity, corruption, sighing, groaning, and decay
The whole universe has been polluted by death, which is the result of the sin that came in through Adam, the head of the old creation
Because of the issues of death, we need the divine priesthood, which is the presence of life and the absence of death
When others come to our home, there should be praising, reality, building up, and growth, not groaning, vanity, corruption, and decay
The Son of God was incarnated, lived on earth, passed through death, was resurrected, and has been fully perfected forever
Christ, the perfected One, is able to save us from all of these by-products of death and to bring us into His perfection
As our Forerunner, Christ has already entered into that complete perfection, and we also will be brought there
Regardless of our situation or the condition in which we may find ourselves, we have the divine priesthood to take care of us
When we come forward to God through Christ our High Priest He saves us in the power of His resurrection and by the law of the Spirit of life
He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God's eternal purpose
Hebrews 8:2 speaks of Christ as 'a Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man'
These verses reveal that Christ as a High Priest is a Minister of the holy places in the heavens before the face of God
We have a Minister in the heavens who has entered into the Holy of Holies in the heavens and appears now before the face of God for us
It refers to all the holy places in the tabernacle; strictly, it refers to the Holy of Holies, the holiest of all the holy places
As the High Priest, He is interceding for us so that everything that He accomplished might be wrought into our being
He ministers the life supply from heaven into the believers that they may receive the enjoyment to function as members of the Body
Hebrews 9:26 tells us that Christ 'has been manifested for the putting away of sin through the sacrifice of Himself'
Since Christ has put away sin in His first appearing , His second appearing will be apart from sin, having nothing whatever to do with it
In other words, Christ appeared the first time to take away our sin and our sins, and He will appear a second time apart from sin
The salvation which Christ will bring to us in His second manifestation is for the redemption, the transfiguration, of our body
At Christ's second coming for the completion of the salvation of our entire being, He will transfigure our vile body into a glorious one
That will be the redemption of our body , the first aspect of Christ's appearing 'unto salvation' in His second manifestation
At His second coming, Christ will free us from this vanity and slavery and deliver us into the freedom of the glory of the children of God
At His second coming, Christ will glorify us ; that is, He will bring us into His glory to fulfill the word in Hebrews 2:10
The more we are transformed in our soul, the more we enjoy the sonship which has been given to us in our spirit
When He sees that the building up of this wonderful salvation has been accomplished, He will appear the second time
In the ministry of His priesthood, Christ is ministering to us all the divine riches in the heavenly atmosphere
To go on to this ministry, we must learn how to follow the Pioneer, the Christ who has become the Forerunner within the veil
The Lord as the Pioneer and Forerunner is the example, the model, of a person who has entered into God's glory
By His growing up, His whole being, including His humanity and His human nature, was brought into the glorious expression of God
He is the example, the model, because He was the first One who pioneered into glory, the One who paved the way
On the one hand, this wonderful One is within the veil, dwelling there in the expression of God and as the expression of God
He entered within the veil as the Pioneer the Forerunner entering into the glory which is the full glorious expression of the Divine Being
Since He was the first to enter into glory, He, as our Forerunner, is fully qualified to be the Captain of our salvation
The Greek word translated 'have fled for refuge' means to flee intensively; it refers to an intensified fleeing
He fled everything to enter into the presence of God within the veil, where we anchor our hope with full assurance
We must flee everything into the Holy of Holies where our Forerunner, Jesus Christ, has entered within the veil
We must flee until we have nothing else to flee from, until we are directly touching God and are face to face with Him
After showing that the heavenly Christ is within the veil, the book of Hebrews encourages us to enter within the veil
The Bible reveals two orders of the priesthood: the order according to Aaron and the order according to Melchizedek
The order of priests according to Aaron was a matter of man bringing his needs to God, because these priests were chosen from among men
He is the High Priest according to the order of Aaron and also the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek
On the one hand, according to the order of Aaron, Christ as the Son of Man was chosen from among men to go to God with all the needs of man
On the other hand, according to the order of Melchizedek, Christ as the Son of God came from God to impart God into us and bless us with God
As our High Priest, the heavenly Christ is not according to the order of Aaron but according to the order of Melchizedek
It is no longer a matter of offering sacrifices for sin but rather a matter of ministering bread and wine for our enjoyment
Today Christ on the throne is not the sacrifice-offering High Priest; He is the bread-and-wine-ministering High Priest
In the book of Hebrews Christ is presented as the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant, the new covenant
Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge that everything in that covenant will be fulfilled
That Christ has become the surety of a better covenant is based on the fact that He is the living and perpetual High Priest
The new covenant, the covenant enacted on the law of life, can never fail because Christ Himself is the surety of this covenant
Christ is not only the consummator of the new covenant; He is also the surety, the pledge that everything in it will be fulfilled
According to Hebrews 8:6, Christ is also 'the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises'
In His heavenly ministry Christ as the Mediator is the Executor of the new covenant the new testament which He bequeathed to us by His death
The Lord Jesus established this new covenant in His own blood, and He also executes this covenant through His incorruptible life
The items of the covenant are things that Christ has already accomplished, and there are no conditions or terms for their completion
By shedding His blood, Christ enacted this deed, the covenant, and through His death He left this title deed to us as a will, a testament
Hebrews 9:16-17 says, 'For where there is a testament, the death of him who made the testament must of necessity be established
For a testament is confirmed in the case of the dead, since it never has force when he who made the testament is living'
A covenant is an agreement made by the giver, which is in effect while he is alive, while a testament is a will
As a covenant Christ is the surety and the Spirit is the pledge to guarantee that God embodied in Christ is the inheritance to His people
We have not only the items of the new testament in our mind but also the reality of this covenant, who is Christ, in our spirit
To be made partakers of Christ means that we have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, the reality of Christ
In Hebrews 721 we see that Christ as the Mediator of the new covenant became the living and perpetual High Priest with the taking of an oath
As the only begotten Son and the firstborn Son of God, Christ became the High Priest with the taking of an oath by God
Hebrews 8:2 says that Christ is a 'Minister of the holy places, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man'
In the old covenant the high priest was a mortal man, and his ministry was a shadow of the good things to come
Just as the motor runs to transmit power into the machine, the interceding Christ in the heavens is transmitting the heavenly power into us
According to Romans 8, Christ is interceding not merely for poor sinners to be justified but for the believers to be glorified
As we pointed out in one of the previous messages, to be glorified is to have our being completely saturated with Christ's divine priesthood
When we pray for the Lord's interests on the earth, we have the deep sense that the Lord's intercession is empowering us from within
Christ's heavenly ministry is not a ministry that takes care of pitiful sinners; it is the more excellent ministry operating God's economy
The new covenant is better than the old covenant, just as the reality of a person is better than his photograph
The Bible is composed of two wills-the Old Testament, which is the old will, and the New Testament, which is the new will
The old covenant had fault and became old, decrepit, and near to disappearing, and the new covenant was consummated to replace it
The forgiveness of sins, being the putting away of sins, is better than the covering of sins, which never removed the sins
In the new covenant there is the law of life, the blessing of having God and of being His people, and the inward ability of knowing God
The old covenant was made with the outward law of letters, whereas the new covenant is enacted with this inward law of life
Since we all, great or small, have the law of life, we do not need outward teachings that are according to the law of letters
The blood by which the new covenant was enacted purifies our conscience from dead works to serve the living God
To worship in dead religion or to serve any dead thing other than God does not require that our conscience be purified
Whenever we have a feeling that we are sinful or wrong, our conscience is dirty and needs the blood to purify it
When God in heaven condemns, the conscience within us also condemns, and when God in heaven releases, our conscience also releases
Paul also tells us that in order to come near to God to contact Him we must have a heart sprinkled from an evil wicked or defiled conscience
We need the blood to bridge the gap between us and God so that we may come into His presence by exercising our spirit to contact Him
We should make a thorough confession of our sins so that our conscience would be purified by the blood of Christ
Through the redeeming blood of Christ, we have life and have been brought into the presence of God to serve Him
We have seen that after the Lord left the covenant with us it became the new testament containing all the accomplished facts as our bequests
While the Lord is resting on His throne in the heavens, He is concerned for all the heirs of this new testament
Because He is so concerned, He is interceding that we will have the full realization of all the bequests contained in His bequeathed will
Most Christians understand God's salvation in a low way according to the natural human concept, not in the way of bequests
If we know God's economy, we will praise the Lord and thank Him for all that He accomplished and bequeathed to us
We simply need to take with thanks to the Lord what has already been given to us in such an extraordinary way-in the way of the new will
When our eyes are opened to see this matter of the bequests in the new testament, our whole concept will be changed
The testament, the will, has been confirmed and validated by Christ's death and is being executed and enforced by Christ in His resurrection
The heavenly Intercessor is motivating and energizing us day by day that we may partake of all the riches of His will
In Matthew 23:35 Abel is called 'righteous Abel'; in Acts 7:52 and 22:14 the Lord Jesus is called the righteous One
We have not only the redeeming blood, the cleansing blood, and the covering blood, but also the speaking blood
All the sacrifices and offerings in the Old Testament are types of Christ as the unique sacrifice and offering in the New Testament
Through Christ as the offerings, we and God, God and we, have a mutual enjoyment, the fellowship of co-enjoyment
Christ offered Himself not only as a sacrifice for sin but also as a gift to please God and thereby make Him happy
God's not delighting in and not requiring sacrifice and offering points to the termination of His economy in the Old Testament
Christ is our sacrifice to deal with sin and sins, and He is our offering, our gift, presented to God for God's satisfaction
Christ came to be the real sacrifice and living offering, who offered Himself on the cross as the reality of all the offerings
He is the reality of the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering
Whenever we sin, we ask God to forgive us, taking Christ, God's Son, as our sin offering and trespass offering
Today God's desire and pleasure are not in animal sacrifices; God's desire and pleasure are altogether in one person-Christ
The Old Testament saints were centered around the sacrifices and the offerings, which meant everything to them
Christ came to do God's will by replacing all the sacrifices and offerings in order that He could be everything to us
The sin offering signifies that Christ was made sin for us that through His death on the cross, sin might be condemned
The meal offering typifies Christ in His humanity and in His human living, which was proper, even, tender, fine, balanced, pure, and sinless
In Himself Christ is the reality of the offerings, but He cannot be this reality to us apart from His being the life-giving Spirit
We need to live a life according to God's heart and will by daily enjoying Christ as the reality of all the offerings
Hebrews 10:10 tells us that by the will of God 'we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all'
As the Initiator of a new and living way, Christ opened the way for us to enter the Holy of Holies by His blood through the veil, His flesh
The Holy of Holies is the place within the veil, where we may enjoy Christ, ministering the riches of God in the heavenly atmosphere
When we receive such riches of the divine being into our being, we enjoy Christ as the Initiator of a new and living way
Without the key of our spirit, Christ would only be objective to us, and we would have no way to enter into Him
On the one hand, we need to have an objective vision of Christ as the One who is superior to Judaism in every aspect
On the other hand, we must realize that today He is the eternal Spirit, the Holy One, who brings Himself into our spirit
When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He fulfilled all the requirements of God's glory, holiness, and righteousness
Through the redemption of the Lord Jesus, the way has been opened for us to contact the tree of life once more
In Hebrews 10 we are told that now, in the New Testament age, there is a new way of entering into the Holy of Holies
Because the Lord has opened the way and brings us in, we may enjoy God in the Holy of Holies and daily be infused with Him
If we care for our fellowship with the Lord and desire to enter into the Holy of Holies, we will immediately sense a condemnation within
When we call upon the name of the Lord, we have the sense that we are in the presence of God and that God is within us
For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls'
All the overcoming saints in the Old Testament are only witnesses of faith, whereas Jesus is the Author of faith
Because Christ Himself is faith, the apostle Paul speaks of the faith of Jesus Christ , the faith of the Son of God , or faith in Christ
When we are impressed with Christ as a figure, an appreciation of this figure is spontaneously produced within us
As we are preaching, what we have received of the Lord will enter, like electricity, into those who are listening
Although they may shake their heads, not consenting to our preaching, deep within they will believe what we are saying
If he is charged and charming, as he stands in front of the people, he will have the sense that something is being transfused into them
We are charged with the divine element, and then in the ministry we radiate that divine element into others in a charming way
Even if we try to deny the Lord, we ultimately find ourselves unable to do so, for Christ as faith has been infused into our being
While we are denying Him, nevertheless there remains the believing element and ability deep within us, which nothing and no one can remove
It is upon this base that we have been blessed and have received all the spiritual, divine, and heavenly things prepared by God
We do not live by our own faith but by the faith of the Son of the living God who has faith and who Himself is faith to us
If we look to Him continually, He will finish and complete the faith that we need for the running of the heavenly race
To enjoy the heavenly Christ we need to look away from all things on earth unto Him who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God
The Greek word translated 'looking away unto' denotes 'looking with undivided attention by turning away from every other object'
The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor , is the greatest attraction in the universe
He transfuses us with Himself, working Himself into us, until He, a living person, becomes the believing element in our being
When we look away unto Christ, we give Him the opportunity and the freedom to work Himself into us as the law of life
If we give the law of life the opportunity to work continuously in our mind, emotion, and will, its working will produce great faith in us
As the law of life works within us to bring about the expression and testimony of God, the first issue of its working is our believing
When the law of life operates within us to make us the reflection, expression, and testimony of God, we find it easy to believe
As we take the Christian way, which is full of suffering, shame, and contradiction, we should look away unto Jesus
When we look away unto Him, He is perfecting, finishing, the faith within us, infusing Himself into us as the believing element and ability
Rather, we need to look away from all our problems unto Jesus and compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself
We should remember that the writer of the book of Hebrews spoke this word after Christ ascended to the heavens
Hebrews 13:12 says, 'Therefore also Jesus, that He might sanctify the people through His own blood, suffered outside the gate'
Christ's body suffered the death of the cross outside the gate, and His blood was brought into the Holy of Holies for our sanctification
The book of Hebrews unveils to us that God's heavenly calling is to make us a holy people , a people sanctified unto God
By participating in Him in this way, we are enabled to follow Him outside the camp on the sanctifying pathway of the cross
Since Jesus suffered outside the gate, those of us who enjoy Him as the sin offering must also be outside the gate
The more we are in our spirit enjoying the heavenly Christ the more we will come outside the camp of religion following the suffering Jesus
Being in our spirit to enjoy the glorified Christ enables us to come outside the camp of religion to follow the rejected Jesus
To enter the veil is to enjoy the heavenly Christ in our spirit, and to go outside the camp is to give up organized religion to follow Jesus
The more we enjoy Him as the heavenly Melchizedek in our spirit, the more we will step outside the camp and give up organized religion
When we testify for the Lord and work for the Lord in our outward living we can be likened to Abigail wandering with David in the wilderness
Inwardly, we have the enjoyment of the Shulammite in the secret place, and outwardly, we have the public living of Abigail
Philippians 3:10 says, 'To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death'
No one can take the way of the cross by himself; neither can he follow the footsteps of Jesus the Nazarene by himself
Within the veil we behold the glorified Christ so that we may be attracted to follow the suffering Jesus outside the camp
The Holy of Holies, the pathway of the cross , and the kingdom are three crucial matters set forth in the book of Hebrews
Hebrews 1315 says Through Him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise continually to God that is the fruit of lips confessing His name
When we bear the reproach of Jesus and suffer on His behalf, we often groan and do not offer any praise to God
Christ as the life-giving Spirit, praises the Father in our spirit, and we, by our spirit, praise the Father in His Spirit
Through the Christ whom we have experienced and enjoyed, we need to offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually
The praises out of our experience and enjoyment of Christ-the spiritual praises about Christ-are the best praise to the Father
Doing good refers to giving, and fellowshipping refers to sharing, that is, having fellowship in the needs of the saints
Today Christ as the High Priest is the Shepherd who takes care of us for the church as we pass through the sufferings of Christ
God raised up our Lord from the dead to be the great Shepherd to consummate the New Jerusalem according to God's eternal covenant
Because of the blood sprinkled in the Holy of Holies, he could enjoy God, behold His beauty, and receive His infusion
22:14 says, 'Blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter by the gates into the city'
We see that through the washing of the blood, we have the right to come to the tree of life and enter into the city, New Jerusalem
God is doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ that we may be able to do His will
In this message we will begin to consider the aspects of the experience and enjoyment of Christ revealed in 1 Peter
To speak of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ is to expound, define, and apply the matter of redemption
According to the teaching of the New Testament, God's salvation is first composed of the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
After a person repents and believes, the first thing God applies to him is the 'sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ'
In keeping with this, the Lord Jesus said in John 12:24 that if a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it bears much fruit
The resurrection of Christ bringing in life and the gift of the lifegiving Spirit is that which potentiates the new birth unto a living hope
Only the divine life can enable us to grow in the divine life until we grow into the reality of the hope that is brought to us by that life
Because creation is our inheritance through birth, we can enjoy the earth, the sunshine, the air, the atmosphere, the rain, and the wind
At the second coming of Christ, our soul will be saved to the uttermost and will be brought into a higher enjoyment of Christ
According to Matthew 25, Christ at His coming back will say to the believers who are faithful slaves, 'Enter into the joy of your master'
The blood of Christ is also the redeeming blood that redeemed us from our vain manner of life, bringing us out of the vanity of human life
As a general principle, the blood of Christ has redeemed us from sins, transgressions, lawlessness, and all sinful things
Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we should pass the days of our sojourning in fear
In order to pass the time of our sojourning in fear, we need a deep realization concerning the redemption of Christ
The blood of Christ is a material substance, yet its effectiveness, function, worth, power, and authority are eternal and incorruptible
The blood of Christ, by which we are sprinkled and thus marked out from common people, is more precious than silver and gold
The highest price has been paid for our redemption that we might be redeemed from a vain manner of life to a holy life
Through this comparison, Peter indicates that the price paid for us by Christ was related to something of life and to something organic
Blemish is a term often used for impurities, foreign bodies, or elements of mixture found in precious stones and gems
We can see from the typology in the Old Testament that the animal sacrifices were to be without blemish and without spot
Among all the human beings who have ever lived on earth, there has been only one man-the Lord Jesus Christ-who is without mixture or blemish
We all have received many wounds to our ethical and moral being; we all must admit that we have not been preserved perfect
The expression without blemish and without spot is an Old Testament term used with respect to sacrifices offered to God
According to both divine and secular law, the Lamb of God was examined and found to be without mixture and without spot
Peter refers to the Old Testament typology, while simultaneously indicating that Christ is the real passover Lamb
He is our sin offering and our trespass offering, the One offered for the propitiation of the sins of God's people
We need to spend a substantial amount of time alone with the Lord to consider the precious blood of Christ shed for us on the cross
If we would live in this way, we need to realize that we were redeemed, purchased, with the high price of Christ's precious blood
In the eternal view of God, from the foundation of the world, that is, since the fall of man as a part of the world, Christ was slain
God's foreknowledge, therefore, means not only that He knew us in eternity past; it also means that He ordained us
God ordained Christ to be the anointed One, the One commissioned to fulfill in time all that had been planned by God
In an eternal ordination ceremony before the foundation of the world, we all were ordained when Christ was ordained
It is a marvelous spiritual fact that we and Christ were foreknown and foreordained by God the Father in eternity past
With God's foreknowledge and foreordination as the basis, Christ came to the earth to be our Redeemer and to accomplish God's purpose
Because we were foreordained by God, the Spirit came to us and did whatever was necessary to cause us to believe in Christ
Christ had already been ordained to be Christ, and we had already been ordained to be Christians in eternity past
One day we heard the preaching of the gospel, repented, believed, called on the Lord, and thanked Him for all He had done for us
Day by day we should enjoy all these items of Christ as the element of Christian experience as revealed in 1 Peter 1
According to Genesis 2, man was placed in front of the tree of life, which was put in the garden of Eden out of which a river flowed
He also is the cornerstone that joins the two walls, one wall being the Jewish believers and the other being the Gentile believers
To the nations, He is the smiting stone that will smite and break into pieces the aggregate of human government at His coming back
To the Pharisees and to all the others who opposed Him, the crucifixion of Christ was a sign that God had rejected Him
Luke 23:35 says, 'The rulers also sneered, saying, He saved others; let Him save Himself if this is the Christ of God, the Chosen One'!
The Greek word rendered 'precious' in 1 Peter 2:4, the same word that is used in verse 6, also means 'held in honor'
There the word denotes preciousness in essence; here it indicates preciousness that is recognized and held in honor
There is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given among men in which we must be saved'
The resurrection and exaltation of Christ are strong signs both that God has chosen Him and that He is held in honor by God
At regeneration we received the seed of the divine life, which by its growing in us transforms us into living stones
In 1 Peter 1:23 Peter said that we have been regenerated through the living and abiding word of God as the incorruptible seed
In 2:4 Peter changed his metaphor from a seed, which is of the vegetable life , to a stone, which is of the minerals
Although some believers visit them and encourage them to come to the meetings, they do not want to attend the meetings
The New Testament believers are priests of God not individually but corporately; they are a body of priests, a priesthood
We all need the corporate service in the spiritual house in order to fulfill God's purpose and satisfy God's desire
Romans 12 speaks clearly of the members of the Body of Christ functioning together in all kinds of ministries and services
It is a dreadful thing to attempt to serve the Lord apart from the proper church life, apart from being built up with others
As we stay in this flow, the current will carry away our natural substance and replace it with Christ as heavenly, divine minerals
Feeding on Christ by taking in the nourishing milk in the word of God is not only for growing in life but also for building up
When we are transformed into the image of Christ and express Him fully, our individualism will disappear automatically
In the New Jerusalem there will not be any clay, for all the clay will have been transformed into precious stones
As the all-inclusive stone, Christ is the centrality of God's move for the building up of His eternal habitation
Everything Christ is, everything He has done, and everything He is doing is due to the fact that He is the cornerstone
In contrast Christ is the foundation stone the cornerstone and the topstone not to be our supply but to be the material for Gods building
In a negative sense, Christ will be a crushing stone to the unbelieving Gentiles and a stone of stumbling to the unbelieving Jews
In verse 8 Peter speaks of those 'who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed'
It is the word quoted by Peter in verses 6 through 8, the word regarding a chosen stone, a cornerstone held in honor, being laid in Zion
Sometimes we may have spoken with certain believers regarding the matter of Christ being both the building stone and the stumbling stone
They have replied that because the Lord Jesus is merciful and has a broad heart, He would never be a stone of stumbling or a rock of offense
Because we in ourselves cannot be without guile, Peter specifically says that no guile was found in the Lord's mouth
He lived a life absolutely under God's government, and He committed everything related to Him to God's judgment
According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross, God took all our sins and put them on this Lamb of God
Through Christ's death we were crucified with Him to sins so that we might live to righteousness, that is, live to God righteously
Apparently, being kept away from sin terminates us; actually, it enlivens us so that we may live to righteousness
According to Genesis 315 the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent and the serpent will bruise the heel of the womans seed
Christ put our sins upon Himself and bore them on the tree, the cross, where He suffered God's righteous judgment for all our sins
Because of the life of Christ within us, we live always with the intention toward righteousness, the inclination toward righteousness
The life-giving Spirit is working within us continually to carry out the subjective aspect of Christ's cross in our being
Daily we are undergoing the inward working of the cross of Christ, and daily we are being made alive so that we may live to righteousness
Peter 2:25 says, 'You were like sheep being led astray, but you have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your soul'
As such, He is able to guide us and supply us with life that we may follow in His steps according to the model of His suffering
From our spirit Christ reaches the parts of our soul-the mind, emotion, and will-and takes care of all our problems, needs, and wounds
All the believers, from the youngest to the most mature, sense that they need such a Shepherd to take care of them
Our problem was that we were like sheep being led astray, but now we have returned, turned back, to the Shepherd and Overseer of our souls
A shepherd takes care of the physical needs of his flock, and Christ our Shepherd takes care of the needs of our soul
Unbelievers have no one to lead them and guide them in making decisions, but we have a Shepherd to lead us and guide us
Leading, like a road map, points us to a destination, whereas guidance directs us to the exact place where we want to go
These disciples were going in one direction, but the Lord went with them in order to turn them to go in another direction
As He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, 'their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him'
Christ's shepherding of His flock includes His caring for their outward things and also their inner being, their soul
Christ indwells us to be our life and everything, but He is also overseeing, observing, the condition and situation of our inner being
In verses 19 and 20, Peter says, 'This is grace, if anyone, because of a consciousness of God, bears sorrows by suffering unjustly
The word this in verse 21 refers to the unjust sufferings, the suffering for doing good, mentioned in verses 19 and 20
Probably very few of us, whether young or old, have realized from verse 21 that we have been called to suffer unjust treatment
We become the reproduction of the original writing copy, not a mere imitation of Him produced by taking Him as our outward model
If we live by Christ as our inward life, that is, by the indwelling Christ Himself, we will become a reproduction of Christ
At the same time we will experience Him as the Substitute saving us as the Shepherd leading and guiding us and as the Overseer caring for us
Verse 18 says, 'Christ also has suffered once for sins, the Righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, that He might bring you to God'
The fact that Christ the righteous One died on behalf of the unrighteous indicates that Christs death was for redemption not for martyrdom
Peter 3:18 goes on to tell us that Christ was 'on the one hand being put to death in the flesh, but on the other, made alive in the Spirit'
The Spirit in which He was made alive is not the Holy Spirit but the Spirit as the essence of Christ's divinity
The crucifixion put Christ to death only in His flesh-which He received through His incarnation -not in His Spirit as His divinity
According to the flesh, He is the seed of David, a man; according to the Spirit of holiness, He is the Son of God
He was designated the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness out of the resurrection of the dead
In John 12:24 the Lord said that He was the grain of wheat which bears much fruit by falling into the ground and dying
The Spirit of holiness resurrected the humanity of Christ and, at the same time, uplifted the humanity of Jesus into divinity
The Lord's going here indicates and proves that Christ, after dying in His flesh, was still active in this Spirit
Throughout the centuries great teachers of different schools have had varying interpretations concerning the spirits in prison
For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection'
In 1 Peter 3:20 Peter says that in the ark prepared by Noah eight souls 'were brought safely through by water'
The Greek word translated 'brought' means 'arrive safe into a place of security through difficulty or danger,' as Acts 27:44
In the Old Testament the waters of the flood at the time of Noah and the waters of the Red Sea both typify baptism
The ark saved Noah and his family from God's judgment, from the punishment of God's condemnation that came by the flood
The water saved them and separated them from that corrupted age and brought them into a new age to begin a new life on a new earth
If the ark of Noah did not represent the Christ of resurrection, how could the ark pass through the water and come out safely?
The ark's passing through the water and coming out of the water signifies Christ's resurrection, since the ark itself is a type of Christ
According to Acts 2:24, death could not hold Christ, but when any other person enters into the realm of death, he is held there
Christ not only entered into death and passed through it; He even deliberately stayed in the realm of death for three days
In His resurrection Christ became the life-giving Spirit to come into us and to impart His resurrection life to us
Now this resurrection life with the life-giving Spirit makes every aspect of Christ's death real and effective to us in our experience
Apart from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we could not have resurrection life, and we could not have the life-giving Spirit within us
It is through the resurrection of Christ that we are brought into the Triune God to have an organic union with Him
It is through the resurrection of Christ that we genuinely experience with assurance the reality of what is figured in baptism
Peter 322 tells us that Christ is at the right hand of God having gone into heaven angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Him
Immediately after mentioning the baptism, Peter speaks of the angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Christ
Through the organic union we are brought not only into Christ's resurrection but also into His ascension and exaltation
We need to sanctify Christ as Lord first in our hearts inwardly and then with a good manner of life in Him outwardly
First in our hearts we respect Him as the Lord; then in our behavior we express Him as the Lord in a good manner of life in Him
If we are terrified and troubled by the persecutors , it will appear that we do not have the Lord in our hearts
In our suffering of persecution, we should make Christ particular; we should show that He is magnificent, absolutely different from idols
Sanctifying Christ as Lord in our hearts is not a matter of outward activity to set Him apart from what is common; it is an inward matter
To sanctify Christ as Lord in our hearts means that when we are under persecution, we have the Lord in our hearts
If we are bold, sanctifying the Lord in our hearts and expressing Him in our faces, others will realize that we do have something within us
Since the conscience is a part of our human spirit , to care for our conscience is to care for our spirit before God
If we would have a good manner of life and sanctify the Lord in our daily life, we must take care of our conscience
We should not be satisfied that we are justified by the community, by the brothers, or even by the entire church
A renewed conscience enlightened by the indwelling Spirit is trustworthy in its testimony and accurate in its judgment
The reason the enlightened conscience of the regenerated spirit can be an inner judge is that it cooperates with the indwelling God
Peter 4:1 says, 'Since Christ therefore has suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind '
In verse 1, Peter advises us to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ, who has suffered in the flesh, that we might cease from sin
One main purpose of 1 Peter is to encourage and exhort the believers to follow the footsteps of Christ in their suffering of persecution
Many Christians think that as long as we love God and do His will, we will be under His blessing and will not suffer in any way
If we have the mind of Christ, we will realize that we are living in a rebellious age and in a crooked, perverted generation
Because the age is rebellious and the generation is perverse, the more we love God and do His will, the more we will suffer
According to Peter's word in 4:1, we need to arm ourselves with the mind of Christ in order to fight against the flesh with its lusts
If we try to arm ourselves with the same mind without having Christ as our life, we will merely be imitating Christ in an outward way
If we have a strong mind to suffer, although we may suffer for the Lord's interests, nothing of poverty or suffering will stumble us
Today we rejoice when we share in the sufferings of Christ because at the unveiling of His glory we will participate in His glory
If we were not Christians, we certainly would not suffer the kind of persecution described in verses 12 and 13
Paul could even say that he made up what was lacking of the sufferings of Christ for the sake of His Body, the church
We may face fiery ordeals, but these are the sufferings of Christ in which we have the privilege to participate
Peter 414 goes on to say If you are reproached in the name of Christ you are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you
The believers having believed into Christ and having been baptized into His name that is into Himself are in Christ and are one with Him
When they are reproached in His name, they are reproached with Him, sharing in His sufferings , in the fellowship of His sufferings
Peter tells us in verse 14 that if we are reproached in the name of Christ, the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon us
When we are willing to suffer for Christ, deep within we sense the Spirit of glory and of God-the Spirit expressed as glory-resting upon us
We should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ, because the Spirit of glory is resting upon us
With the martyrs, usually at the moment they suffer martyrdom, there is a condition showing that God is expressed
When Christians suffer for the Lord, the Spirit of Christ rests upon them to express and release God from within them
Christians are not like this, because the indwelling Spirit, who is also the Spirit of glory, rests upon them to manifest the glory of God
If we are willing to be persecuted for the Lord and suffer under Gods governmental dealing the Spirit of glory and of God will rest upon us
When we are reproached in the name of Christ, the Son of God, we are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God the Father rests upon us
When the believers of the Son are reproached, the Triune God is enjoying His rest by staying with them in their persecution
In 1 Peter 4:16 we are told that 'if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name'
The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire
One who worshipped the emperor the Caesar or Kaisar was called Kaisarianos which means an adherent of Kaisar a person who belongs to Kaisar
When people believed in Christ and became His followers, some in the Empire came to consider Christ a rival of their Kaisar
At Antioch they began to call the followers of Christ Christianoi , adherents of Christ, as a nickname, a term of reproach
Today we should be witnesses and partakers of Christ's sufferings so that we will be partakers of His glory to be revealed
He was a leading witness, a martyr, one who was willing to sacrifice his life to testify of the sufferings of Christ
If we are willing to be martyred, if we are willing to risk our lives, then surely we will be partakers of the glory to be revealed
If we are not willing to sacrifice our lives, then instead of partaking of glory at the Lord's coming, we will probably be rebuked by Him
Committing our souls to a faithful Creator is effective only if we are engaged in well-doing, that is, if we are doing noble deeds
Because Peter was a noble witness, a noble martyr, he had the assurance that he would be a partaker of the coming glory
If we are willing to sacrifice in this way, then we will be witnesses of the sufferings of Christ and partakers of the coming glory
He leads us to feed, look after, teach, and guide the flock of God according to God's intention and to become patterns of the flock
When we shepherd, it should be Christ shepherding through us; it should be He who is in us urging us to shepherd others
The reward to the elders will be the unfading crown of glory, which they will receive at the manifestation of the Chief Shepherd
It will be a portion of the glory for the overcomers' enjoyment in the manifestation of the kingdom of God and Christ
After we have suffered a little while, the God of all grace will personally perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us
When we consider all these precious items of Christ revealed in 1 Peter, we can see a view of the rich enjoyment that we may have in Him
