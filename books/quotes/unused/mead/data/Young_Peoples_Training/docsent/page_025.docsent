   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEARING SPIRITUAL CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND CARING FOR THEM</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>People cannot take things in once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those who acquire a college education spend at least sixteen years in school: six years in elementary school, three years in junior high school, three years in high school, and four years in college.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you want to obtain a masters degree or a Ph.D., you will need even more time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to Paul s pattern, we should not only help people to be saved, to be forgiven of their sins, and to be regenerated; we must also help them grow.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A mother not only gives birth to her child but cares for her child daily for at least eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do not cling to the concept that as long as a person is saved everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is like a mother neglecting her child as soon as he is born.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you do this, you are cruel and have no kindness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must love our babes and care for them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul said, For though ye have ten thousand teachers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel 1 Cor 4:15, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>. He even speaks of Timothy as his true child in the faith 1 Tim 1:2, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>. We all should adopt this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who are converted, being our children, should be precious to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If, beginning now, we are all impressed that this is the Lord s way of outreach in His recovery and practice this way, a year from now we all shall have a child in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is a human desire for married people to want children.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But in the eyes of God this is not as crucial as having children in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Children in the flesh are only good to cross us out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I crossed out my mother time and time again, and I have been crossed out many times by my own children.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Praise the Lord that there is another kind of child a true child in the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A child in the faith is dear and precious.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope that in a few months many of us will be pregnant, and that by the end of the year many will give birth to a child.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Lord delays His coming back, you may deliver a child in faith every year.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, some of them may become elders in the churches or ministers of the Word in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How wonderful this would be!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must practice this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Humanly speaking, we need much learning and, spiritually speaking, we need a great deal of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then we shall be able to help people and to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you have this learning and revelation, you will know the proper time to give the supply to the one on whom you are working.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I hope that many of you will practice this way, not only by yourselves but in groups, coming together to pray, to fellowship, and to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe that the Lord will afford us the grace we need.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then in His recovery we shall have a solid foundation for a proper increase.</S>
