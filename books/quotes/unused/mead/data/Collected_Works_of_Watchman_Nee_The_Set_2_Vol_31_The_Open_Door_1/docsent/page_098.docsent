   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Three God's Attraction</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank and praise the blessed God!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>His faithfulness, love, and mercy enable me to live joyously during these days.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Indeed, He is the only precious One.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Giver is much greater than all the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His forgiveness is more abundant than our experience of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He Himself is superior to His grace and love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is very good for us to enjoy His grace and love, but it is so much better to personally enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I want to completely and absolutely enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reality of my present condition is actually the opposite of what you expected because I have not progressed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the contrary, I fail daily.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What He gives me is like a spring breeze, but my experience is like the fallen leaves and dry, dead branches of the middle of winter!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not know whether this is a suffering or a joy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You must know it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Are there not many old things in me?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the wise God continues to trim me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I look back on my experience, I will be dragged into a den of tears!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thankfully, He attracts me with nothing but Himself and upholds me.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our Attitude toward Those with Different Light</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We cannot say that we will never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should also be careful for the sake of others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My past experience and today's light show me that my errors have been more than my obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am afraid that our living unwittingly becomes a stumbling block to others!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I really have nothing that is better than others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not submit more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything that I have comes from bathing in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There are still many areas where I need the Lord's forgiveness, mercy, grace, enlightenment, instruction, and perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For this reason, I need the cross and the deeper work of the Holy Spirit in my attitude toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only when I have new light will my experience become more real.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then I will be acceptable before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The flesh is hasty and lacks love!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I need to wait and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord needs to give us a proper attitude to receive others' opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am afraid that it is easier for those who have received the light of the truth to fall into coldness and unkindness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I was this way before, so I hope you will be careful in this matter!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord gave a good testimony concerning the truth before Pilate.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one could find any fault in Him hardness or impoliteness with which to condemn Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May we live Him out.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The preceding two portions are excerpts from a letter written by a certain sister to a sister in K'un-ming Editor.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY BROTHER WATCHMAN NEE</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Four years ago, I publicly answered a letter from Brother Wang Kai-sen about a group of brothers being called the "Open Brethren" and whether or not they were a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Not long ago when I was in Southeast Asia, a brother an Englishman in Tai-Ping wanted to prove that these brothers were not a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After listening to him, I still believe that much of what I wrote before is correct.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is one point that he mentioned, however, that certainly is true.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He pointed out that the phrase Christian Missions in Many Lands does not represent a mission board, because "missions" is plural.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, the word "in" is used instead of the word "of."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although I have seen people who consider this group an organization and abbreviate it as C.M.M.L., I believe my brother's word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, I am making a statement concerning this matter so that all the brothers will know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We know that the churches in the Bible are local, so we cannot say and we have no need to say who is and who is not a denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All we have to ask is whether a church is a church in the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We cannot say whether the Brethren in a certain place are a denomination or not.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should determine this by the condition in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May God give us grace, and I ask the brothers to forgive my inaccuracy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please read The Normal Christian Church Life when it is published.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>March 5, 1938</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>in Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>INTRODUCING THE NORMAL CHRISTIAN CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise and thank God that although the ages pass away and environments change, His works are eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The truth He ordains cannot be worn away by time.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The gifts He has given in Christ are new in every age.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, in every age He raises up witnesses who are according to His heart to testify of His Son Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must thank and praise God for this!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Many witnesses and specific testimonies are needed in all the churches today, but the most urgent testimony is a scripturally-based ascertaining of God's work, the church's organization, the principles of the apostles' work, and the establishment of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The main goal of this book is to meet this need and to resolve many difficult questions concerning the various aspects of the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The title of the book is Rethinking Our Work The Normal Christian Church Life ; it was written by Brother Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Its value is priceless, and its nature is special.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is based purely on the special revelation of God and the special light of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In my opinion this book can be called a constitution among the churches of God today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>It is the outline of the organization of the local churches and a bright light to the apostles who go out for their work.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is a guiding star for Christian unity.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>My crude phrases cannot give a good introduction to the highlights of the book.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I only hope that the readers will read it from cover to cover several times to obtain all the truth and blessings in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>There are ten chapters in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Every section of every chapter is based on scriptural facts and proofs.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It explains the New Testament work during the apostolic age and the principles for establishing churches.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>It also provides detailed answers to many important questions about the work and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The nature of this book is particular, and its messages are important.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We who serve the Lord full-time must read it.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The elders who bear responsibility in each locality must also read it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Even more all the children of the Father should have a copy, and they should read and consider it again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May all the brothers who read this book gain the light of the Holy Spirit, and may they realize that God's goal is not just for Christ to be the individual Christ but the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The center of all of God's work is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He is the Lord of all, and He is worthy to be praised eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The readers should also know that God is still the rewarder of those who seek Him with all their heart.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>For this reason, I hope that all the brothers would not only receive the light of the truth but also become channels of life in the church today to the glory of God the Father until the Lord Christ returns.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is my earnest hope.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Philip Luan,</S>
