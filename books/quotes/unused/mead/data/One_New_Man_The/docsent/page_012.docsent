   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Raising Up of Great Britain for the Spread of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For fulfilling His purpose to spread the gospel to the whole world, God needed to defeat Spain.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For this, God raised up Britain.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From the time that the British navy defeated the Spanish Armada in 1588, Britain became the leading power on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Britain became Great Britain, and was called the nation without sunset, for throughout the whole earth there were British colonies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Great Britain maintained a peaceful order over the world for the spreading of the gospel in the way of Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By God's sovereignty, world influence shifted from Catholicism to Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God raised up Britain for His purpose, to send His gospel to Asia, Africa, and many other places, without the dark influence of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If China had been too much influenced by Catholicism, the Lord's recovery could not have had such a start there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, Christianity in China was not under Catholicism but under Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The pure situation there was used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this it is clear that Britain was used by God for spreading the gospel to every corner of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Raising Up of the United States for the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By the beginning of this century the gospel had been spread to every corner of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, God's purpose was not only gospel preaching but the perfection of the one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Britain was not so useful for this end, so through the two world wars, God somewhat put Britain down and raised up the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was through the United States that these two wars were ended.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first world war was ended through the intervention of the United States, and in the second world war the United States was crucial in defeating the axis powers both in Europe and in Asia.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All this happened under God's sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through these two wars the United States was raised up for the perfection of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today this country is at the geographic center, the crossroads, of the whole earth, and is like a giant eagle with the two biggest oceans as its two wings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Roman Empire was raised up for the formation and propagation of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then Spain was raised up temporarily for the spreading of western culture, even though it was under the influence of Catholicism, which was unsuitable for God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Britain defeated Spain and became the leading power of the world for the spreading of the gospel to every corner of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Fourth and last, the United States was raised up as the center of the inhabited earth for the purpose of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This new man is not of any one race; it is of all the races.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because of this, one country had to be raised up by God in the very center of the populated earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The United States is not composed with a single race.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is a nation composed with many peoples, a "melting pot."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to recent immigration laws, this country may receive 300,000 immigrants yearly 130,000 from the Western Hemisphere and another 170,000 from outside this hemisphere.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of race or country of origin, anyone may apply for entry.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since the new immigration law, many thousands have come from China, Italy, Greece, the Philippines, India, and other nations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Second, this country conducts much cultural exchange.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The United States does not like to remain private; it shares many of its good things with other peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There are many exchange students in the United States for the blending of the human races.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In this way the United States is working for God, and this country is being used by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Also, in all of history there has never been such a country that helped other nations as this one does.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Billions of dollars in American economic and military aid go out to many countries.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Fourth, the American dollar is the standard among the world's currencies.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Neither German marks or Japanese yen are the standard today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even in Japan, wealth is counted by the accumulation of American dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The whole world spends American money.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By this we may realize the sovereignty of our Father for the purpose of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these things indicate that we are surely near the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If God perfects the new man at this time, there will be nothing more for Him to do in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Geographically speaking, the Lord has raised up a country for His purpose in the very center of the whole inhabited earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As an American citizen holding an American passport, you may travel throughout the whole world, in the same way that Paul, as a Jew with Roman citizenship, could travel throughout the Roman Empire cf.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Acts 22:25-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When mainland China was lost to the Communists in 1949, I could not sleep or eat well.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I was very sorrowful over the loss of that country and hundreds of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But now, since I have realized the situation today, I am happy that I am here in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To be here is much better than to be in my hometown in mainland China.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We all have to give thanks to the Lord that we are in the United States, in the center of the inhabited earth for the perfection of the new man that God intends to have in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Throughout all the centuries the Lord has blockaded Russia and confined it to the cold region.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Russian czars tried their best to get out of the Black Sea and into the Mediterranean, but God used Britain to close the outlet from the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Russia tried as well to use the Suez Canal to get into the Indian Ocean, but God again used Britain and Egypt to close the way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Later, the czars attempted to build the Siberian railway to provide access to the Pacific Ocean, but were not able to.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Instead, they invaded Manchuria, the territory of China, to get the right to build the Manchurian Railroad.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The czars were happy because they had gained access to the Pacific, but they were later driven out of Manchuria in the Russo-Japanese War.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Although today the Russian fleet is in the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, they will still not have convenient access to the Suez Canal due to the relationship between Egypt and Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our God has blockaded and confined Russia to the "refrigerator" in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He would not tolerate Russia gaining any part of the two major oceans, the Atlantic and the Pacific.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God is sovereign in keeping the world really free for the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now we are right in the center of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must grasp the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Within a short time the new man will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be a Christian in the Lord's recovery for the new man is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all have to forget about today's religion and see the vision of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God has done everything to bring all the peoples together, especially in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Everything is for the new man.</S>
