   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE WAY FOR THE PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:1-2; Rom 16:16; 1 Cor 14:33; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:11; 1 Cor 1:12-13; 3:4-8, 21-23; 4:1, 6; Acts 28:30-31</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With any kind of practice there is the need of two things: the life and the way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the preceding chapters, we have seen the life for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the life of Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have this life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we need the way to match this life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the next few chapters, we will cover the proper way for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may liken the life to the wine and the way to the wineskin Matt 9:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When you have the wine, you need the wineskin to contain the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may also liken the life to the tea and the way to the teacup.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you have the tea, you need the teacup.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We appreciate the tea and we are going to drink the tea, but we also need the teacup.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why we are burdened concerning the way for the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE CHURCH OF GOD, THE CHURCHES OF CHRIST, AND THE CHURCHES OF THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to help us understand this matter in an adequate way, I would ask you to read a number of passages from the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, we want to read 1 Corinthians 1:1-2: "Paul, a called apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother, to the church of God which is in Corinth..."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this passage I would ask you to pay attention to this term "the church of God...in Corinth."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostle used two phrases to qualify the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First, it is the church of God, and then it is the church in the place where the saints are.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The saints of Corinth were in the place of Corinth, so their church was called the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, we have "the church of God...in Corinth."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then Romans 16:16b says, "All the churches of Christ greet you."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, 1 Corinthians 14:33 says, "As in all the churches of the saints."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So in these three passages we have three terms: the church of God, the churches of Christ, and the churches of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God, Christ, and the saints these are the owners of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is owned by God, by Christ, and by the saints because the church is called the church of God, the church of Christ, and the church of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Scripture you cannot find a passage that says the church is the church of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You cannot find such a term because the church or the churches are not something of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is something of God, of Christ, and of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostles are not the owners of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are servants or ministers of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God and Christ are the Owners of the churches, and the saints are also the owners of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>ONE CHURCH FOR ONE CITY,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>ONE CITY WITH ONE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Acts 8:1 we have this expression "the church which was in Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the early days, the church in Jerusalem had more than ten or twenty thousand members Acts 21:20 note 201 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One day they had about three thousand baptized Acts 2:41 , and then on another day they had about five thousand 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are also told that the believers were all the more being added to the Lord and that they multiplied greatly 5:14; 6:1, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They had such a big membership and they met in many homes, "breaking bread from house to house" 2:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yet they were still called the church, the one church not the churches , in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now let us turn to Acts 13:1.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse says, "Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers..."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Here it does not say "in Antioch, in the local churches," but "in Antioch, in the local church."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This indicates that in one locality, in one place, in one city, there is only one local church.</S>
