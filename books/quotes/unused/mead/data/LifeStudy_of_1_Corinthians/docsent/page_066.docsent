   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PLANTS ON GOD S FARM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the members of the church are plants on God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They have been planted by the ministers of Christ, God s fellow-workers, they have been watered by other ministers, also God s fellow-workers, and they are made to grow in life by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We become members of the church not by the way of joining a social organization, but by being planted.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 6 Paul says, I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul planted the believers at Corinth into the church, which is God s farm, so that they might grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is a very significant matter to be a plant on God s farm.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is no need on the farm for a teacher to instruct the plants.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A plant does not need anyone to tell it what to do or how to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, among Christians today a great deal of teaching is given to the plants.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, the believers are regarded not as plants, but as students, as learners.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before I came into the church life, I was a student in the Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although I learned a great deal about the Bible, I was dying for the lack of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of living like a plant, I was living like a student.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am even concerned that in some local churches there is a school instead of a farm.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There may be teaching, but very little watering of the plants.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all should practice the church life in the way of farming, in the way of planting, watering, cultivating, and trimming.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must learn when to water the saints, when to feed them, and when to trim them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>GROWING MATERIALS FOR GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Planted, watered, and made to grow v. 6 are all related to the matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This indicates that the believers are God s farm to grow Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As plants on God s farm, the church, we need to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without growth, we are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some of the plants in my garden at home are living, but they do not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In like manner, there are many believers today who are alive spiritually, but they do not grow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Of course, it is better to live than to die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as we are alive, we have the opportunity to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I hope that no one in the Lord s recovery will be content to live without growing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all must grow to produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the saints in the Lord s recovery must be desperate to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should pray, Lord, grant me the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The purpose of our growth on God s farm is to produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Just as it is the goal of a vineyard to produce grapes, it is the goal of God s farm to produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The central point of these messages on 1 Corinthians 3 is growing to produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a help in growing Christ, we need to consider chapters one and two again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you read and pray-read these chapters, you will be watered and nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The very element and substance of Christ will be imparted into your being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then spontaneously you will grow and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The issue of your growth will be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Paul s intention in 1 Corinthians 1 and 2 is to present Christ as our portion, enjoyment, life, living, content, and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Christ should be our one choice, preference, taste, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should enjoy Christ to such an extent that we do not care for culture of any kind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead of living culture, we live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ becomes everything to us in our daily living our culture, our ethics, and our morality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we grow properly, Christ will be produced in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then whatever we grow of Christ will become the materials for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is built only with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the church is not built with the objective Christ, with a Christ who is in the heavens or who suddenly descends from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>On the contrary, the church is built with the Christ we experience and who is even the produce grown by us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, for the building of the church, we must have the Christ who is produced through our growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Life-study of Exodus we pointed out that the materials used for the building of the tabernacle were called heave offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that the materials created by God had to be gained, possessed, enjoyed, and treasured by God s redeemed people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then the people were to bring these materials and present them to God as heave offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Only materials gained, possessed, and offered in this way could be the proper materials for the building of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This signifies that we need to gain, possess, and enjoy the riches of Christ until they become our treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we need to bring what we have experienced of Christ to the church meetings and offer this Christ to the Lord as a heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Christ will then become the materials used for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because today s Christians do not experience Christ and produce Christ, there is no building among them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Building the church is not merely a matter of preaching the gospel, saving sinners, and bringing these newly saved ones into a so-called church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not the building up of the church; it is the piling up of raw materials.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Among most believers today the best that can be seen is such a piling up of building materials.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But where is the genuine building?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There is no building because there is no experience of Christ, no growing of Christ as the material for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now that we have seen that we are God s farm, we must grow in the divine life to produce Christ.</S>
