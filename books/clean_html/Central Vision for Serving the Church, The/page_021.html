<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE CENTRAL LINE CLOSELY</h2>
<p>There is only one central vision in the Bible. When I took part in the Lord&rsquo;s work in China, I never gave my own messages; I followed Brother Nee. Even though I learned many things after my salvation and I could have said much concerning biblical types and prophecies, I saw the central vision that the Lord had shown Brother Nee. From that point forward, I did not speak anything different from Brother Nee even if I saw something. Even if I had tried, I could not have thought of a new trick or new way to lead the churches other than Brother Nee&rsquo;s way. We have only one Bible, and there is only one central vision in the Bible. Furthermore, God has only one purpose, one way, in the universe. I followed Brother Nee because he did not deviate from this central vision. Today I have an absolute assurance related to our way. Even some brothers in the United States, who felt that they could do things by themselves, eventually saw this vision and began to take this way.</p>
<p>I am not afraid of letting people compare our goods; I am only afraid of people not having an eye for the goods. If we have gold, but someone else has only brass, it is foolish for him to insist that brass is better. A wise person will drop the brass and take the gold. The saints who have entered into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the United States have an eye for the goods. They want only what is real and genuine. We must see that there is only one Bible, one mystery, one purpose, and one way. We cannot say that God has not given us a clear vision. We have many books and messages; we are rich indeed. If we set these things aside and look for something new, we will find only &ldquo;fig leaves&rdquo; that cannot satisfy our hunger, quench our thirst, or cover our nakedness (cf. Gen. 3:7). This will only waste our time and be a disservice to ourselves and others. Eventually, we will still need to turn and be under this vision.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPENDING TIME TO ENTER INTO THE LORD&rsquo;S RICHES</h2>
<p>Since we have so many truths and have published so many messages, the co-workers should fellowship with the elders in every locality and pray and pursue these messages together. By spending time to work the content of these messages into us and by leading the churches according to this content, the churches in every locality will be able to take this vision as their way and goal.</p>
<p>Educational programs throughout the world are developing in comparable ways. After a century of experience, a practical system of education has been discovered. Today everyone learns by passing through an elementary, high school, and college program. In different countries the system of learning is quite similar because there is no system superior to this. Though countries may be different, their system of educational progression and their educational content are similar. Thus, it is possible for one to graduate from a high school in Taiwan and study at a university in the United States. In both developed and underdeveloped countries, there is a consistency in their educational programs. In order to bring the church into the Lord&rsquo;s desire so that the Lord can accomplish His purpose, we must be consistent and faithful to the truth of the central mystery that the Lord has entrusted to us. Even if food is cooked differently, the ingredients must be the same. Beef can be cooked in different ways, but we still must eat beef. If we have beef, we should not prepare the bark and roots of a tree as food. This will result in death due to malnutrition. We should feed the saints healthy food, such as beef, bread, rice, vegetables, and fruit.</p>
<p>I hope that the co-workers will see that we must lead the church according to the Lord&rsquo;s desire. The Lord has had mercy on us for many years by clearly showing us the central line of His desire. Thus, the elders and co-workers must come together to study the Bible and our books little by little to supply the saints. New tricks are useless. We must provide beef, bread, rice, vegetables, and fruit every day of the year so that the saints may have healthy meals. Once the church is richly supplied and well nourished, every &ldquo;germ&rdquo; will be killed, and the church will be strong.</p>
<p>I hope that the co-workers and the elders accept this fellowship and go on steadfastly and practically. Not only have we been giving these messages for nearly fifty years; we have published almost all of them in books. Hence, we must spend the time to enter into them in order to know our way. If we can only speak the words of these messages, they will be of little use. We must be the first ones to enter into the practicality of these words by living according to them and by releasing the riches in them through fellowship. This will supply the church by dispensing the riches into the saints.</p>
