In your most recent going out to visit people by door-knocking, you baptized more than one hundred persons, and some of the teams even baptized more than ten. This rate is amazing, and it proves that you have become very proficient through practice. This reminds me of the time when I first came to Taiwan. Taiwan did not produce pears and grapes, so the Americans came to help by forming the Agricultural Restoration Committee solely for the purpose of researching the cultivation and improvement of the various kinds of fruit trees. Their practice was to first find the good seeds and then find the most suitable way to grow them. Consequently, today Taiwan produces delicious pears and grapes. This shows us that regardless of what we do, we need to research and improve.<h2 class=head1>GOOD SEEDS</h2><p>Now no doubt in the Lord&#8217;s recovery we have the best &#8220;seeds,&#8221; The Mystery of Human Life being one of them. It is likely that we still can produce even better booklets. This requires our research and improvement.<p>Seventy years ago when I was just beginning to learn things, due to the high infant mortality rate, the average life expectancy of the Chinese was only about fifty. Now the average life expectancy of the Chinese is over seventy; the reason is that the child mortality rate now is very low due to the advancement in medicine and diet. Although the United States is rich, the people there are negligent in the matter of diet; it is as if they are committing a slow suicide. I am not a physician, but I was sick with tuberculosis forty years ago and spent two and a half years recuperating before I completely recovered. Hence, I also learned some medical knowledge. Actually, there are three things that the Americans should not consume. The first thing is tobacco. Even the United States government requires tobacco companies to place a label on cigarette cartons warning that &#8220;smoking may cause cancer.&#8221; Now it further requires that the label be changed to say that &#8220;smoking will cause cancer.&#8221; The Americans, however, are not afraid to die, and a great number of them are still smoking.<p>The second thing that people should not consume is cured pork; this is according to the research of the United States government. Twenty years ago, the medical profession, based on the autopsy of soldiers killed in the Vietnam war, discovered that many of these young soldiers had about two-thirds of their blood vessels blocked. This indicates that the majority of young Americans have this condition. Accordingly, we may infer that they may die before the age of fifty due to blockage of the blood flow. The third thing is desserts. Young people in America may listen to their parents when they are still very young, but as they grow up, they do not eat a good breakfast but rather eat doughnuts and other sweet things. The more they eat sweets, the sooner they die. These are statistics from the medical field which we cannot help but believe.<p>In the Lord&#8217;s recovery, our seeds are all good; we have neither &#8220;cured pork&#8221; nor &#8220;desserts.&#8221; In 1954 I had a summer training in Hong Kong, and I told the saints clearly that there is nothing in Christianity today. When you go to the Christian bookstores, you cannot buy any &#8220;food&#8221;; even if there is some &#8220;food,&#8221; it is just &#8220;small candies.&#8221; But the truths which I have received from the Lord and the messages which I have released do not contain any &#8220;sugar&#8221;; they are like authentic Shangtung steamed bread. When the southerners make steamed bread, they always add sugar to it. But the really tasty steamed bread does not need anything added to it; it is made in such a way that the fragrance of the wheat comes out. Today&#8217;s so-called Peking cuisine, which previously was the imperial cuisine, is actually the Shangtung cuisine, which is the highest art of cooking in China. The reason that the Shangtung cuisine is so good is that it does not have added ingredients; rather, it brings out the original flavor of the things created by God. Like the Shangtung cuisine, the messages I give are of the real natural flavor, without other things added and without eloquence. I simply serve the original flavor of the revelations given to me by the Lord.<p>Why is your visitation by door-knocking so speedy and effective? It is because the materials we gave you are good seeds. To use The Mystery of Human Life as the seed is right, but I hope that we can still improve it. I would like to see The Mystery of Human Life enriched with a small amount of &#8220;protein&#8221; and &#8220;aged ginseng.&#8221; Protein is very nutritious and can make one restful; the &#8220;aged ginseng&#8221; can strengthen and sustain one&#8217;s life. I have been told that when someone is about to die, if he eats a slice of aged ginseng, he will be sustained for five days; hence, it is precious. If The Mystery of Human Life contains these two ingredients, then your door-knocking surely will be even more effective.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_063.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_065.html">Next</a> </body></html>
